The brain depends on its arteries to bring fresh blood from the heart and lungs. The blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain, and takes away carbon dioxide and cellular waste. If an artery is blocked, the brain cells (neurons) cannot make enough energy and will eventually stop working. If the artery remains blocked for more than a few minutes, the brain cells may die. The most common problem is narrowing of the arteries in the neck or head. This is most often caused by atherosclerosis, or gradual cholesterol deposition. If the arteries become too narrow, blood cells may collect and form blood clots. These blood clots can block the artery where they are formed (thrombosis), or can dislodge and become trapped in arteries closer to the brain (embolism). Another cause of  stroke is blood clots in the heart, which can occur as a result of irregular heartbeat (for example, atrial fibrillation), heart attack, or abnormalities of the heart valves. While these are the most common causes of ischemic stroke, there are many other possible causes. Examples include use of street drugs, traumatic injury to the blood vessels of the neck, or disorders of blood clotting.

ALD is a disease in a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. Adrenoleukodystrophy progressively damages the myelin sheath, a complex fatty neural tissue that insulates many nerves of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Without functional myelin, nerves are unable to aid in the conduction of an impulse, which leads to increasing disability.\n\nThere are several different types of the disease which can be inherited, but the most common form is an X-linked condition. X-linked ALD primarily affects males, but about one in five women with the disease gene develop some symptoms. Adrenomyeloneuropathy is a less-severe form of ALD, with onset of symptoms occurring in adolescence or adulthood. This form does not include cerebral involvement, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of all males with adrenal insufficiency. Although they share a similar name, X-linked ALD and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), a peroxisome biogenesis disorder, are completely different diseases.\n\nPatients with X-linked ALD have defects in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family D (ALD), member 1 transporter protein, which is encoded by the ABCD1 gene. The ABCD1 (aka ALDP) protein is indirectly involved in the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) found in the normal diet. Lack of this protein can give rise to an over-accumulation of VLCFAs which can lead to damage to the brain, adrenal gland, and peripheral nervous system.\n\nAlthough this disorder affects the growth and/or development of myelin, leukodystrophies are different from demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis where myelin is formed normally but is lost by immunologic dysfunction or for other reasons.\n\none of a group of genetic disorders called the\u00a0leukodystrophies\u00a0that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. People with ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex because they do not produce the enzyme that breaks down these fatty acids in the normal manner. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of ALD. ALD has two subtypes. The most common is the\u00a0X-linked form (X-ALD),\u00a0which involves an abnormal gene located on the X-chromosome. Women have two X-chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X-chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X-chromosome, they are more severely affected. Onset of X-ALD can occur in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. In the milder\u00a0adult-onset form,\u00a0which typically begins between ages 21 and 35, symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia.

They can be caused by deficiencies of enzyme activities ( SPHINGOMYELIN PHOSPHODIESTERASE) or defects in intracellular transport, resulting in the accumulation of SPHINGOMYELINS and CHOLESTEROL. There are various subtypes based on their clinical and genetic differences (MeSH).\n\nNiemann-Pick disease refers to a group of diseases passed down through families (inherited) in which fatty substances called lipids collect in the cells of the spleen, liver, and brain.\n\nThere are four most commonly recognized forms of the disease: Types A, B, C, and D. Types A and B are also called Type I. Types C and D are also known as Type II.\n\nEach type involves different organs and may or may not involve the central nervous system or respiratory system. Each one can cause different symptoms and may occur at different times throughout life, from infancy to adulthood.\n\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\n\nNiemann-Pick disease Type A and B occur when cells in the body lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASM helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell of the body.\n\nIf ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This leads to cell death and makes it hard for organs to work properly. Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities, but higher rates are seen in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jew population.\n\nNiemann-Pick Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and excessive amounts of other lipids in the brain.\n\nThere may be reduced ASM activity in some cells. Type C Niemann-Pick disease has been reported in all ethnic groups but it is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.\n\nType D Niemann-Pick involves a defect that interferes with the movement of cholesterol between brain cells. It is now thought to be a variant of type C. This type of Niemann-Pick disease has only been found in the French Canadian population of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.\n\nThere may also be an adult-onset form of Niemann-Pick disease. It is sometimes referred to as Type E disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nType A usually begins in the first few months of life. Symptoms may include:\n    Abdominal (belly area) swelling within 3 - 6 months\n    Cherry red spot in the eye\n    Feeding difficulties\n    Loss of early motor skills (gets worse over time)\n\nType B symptoms are usually milder and occur in late childhood or adolescence. Abdominal swelling may occur in early childhood, but there is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some patients may have repeated respiratory infections.\n\nType C usually affects school-aged children, but the disease may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood. Symptoms may include:\n    Difficulty moving limbs (dystonia)\n    Enlarged spleen\n    Enlarged liver\n    Jaundice at (or shortly after) birth\n    Learning difficulties and intellectual decline (dementia)\n    Seizures\n    Slurred, irregular speech\n    Sudden loss of muscle tone which may lead to falls (cataplexy)\n    Tremors\n    Trouble moving the eyes up and down (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy)\n    Unsteady gait, clumsiness, walking problems (ataxia)\n\nSymptoms of Type D are similar to Type C.\n\nType E occurs in adults. Symptoms include swelling of the spleen and brain and nervous system (neurological) problems. Little is known about this rare type of Niemann-Pick disease.\n\nSymptoms and disease progression of all forms of Niemann-Pick vary from person to person. Other, more common, diseases may cause symptoms similar to Niemann-Pick.\n\nA person in the early stages of the disease may show only a few symptoms. Not every symptom will be seen in the later stages of the disease.\nSigns and tests\n\nType A and B are diagnosed by measuring the amount of ASM in white blood cells. The test can be done using a blood or bone marrow sample. Such testing can tell who has the disease, but does not reveal who may be carriers. DNA tests can be done to diagnose carriers of Type A and B.\n\nA skin biopsy is usually used to diagnose Type C and Type D Niemann-Pick. Laboratory scientists will watch how the skin cells grow and study how they move and store cholesterol. DNA tests may also be done to look for the two genes that cause Niemann-Pick disease Type C.\n\nOther tests might include:\n    Bone marrow aspiration\n    Liver biopsy (usually not necessary)\n    Slit-lamp eye exam\n    Sphingomyelinase assays", "reference": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002187/", "annotations": {"hasDbXref": [{"identifier": "hasDbXref", "language": "undefined", "value": "http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF/Dysfunction/NIF-Dysfunction.owl#birnlex_12538", "type": "label"}, {"identifier": "hasDbXref", "language": "undefined", "value": "birnlex_12538", "type": "label"}], "IAO_0000115": [{"identifier": "IAO_0000115", "language": "undefined", "value": "A group of autosomal recessive disorders in which harmful quantities of lipids accumulate in the viscera and the central nervous system.

A protein is described as being amyloid if, due to an alteration in its secondary structure, it takes on a particular aggregated insoluble form, similar to the beta-pleated sheet.

A compelling reason for this decision is that the term 'amyloid' is historically applied loosely in the medical literature.

Common initial manifestations include paranoia; poor impulse control; DEPRESSION; HALLUCINATIONS; and DELUSIONS. Eventually intellectual impairment; loss of fine motor control; ATHETOSIS; and diffuse chorea involving axial and limb musculature develops, leading to a vegetative state within 10-15 years of disease onset.

It typically becomes noticeable in middle age. HD is the most common genetic cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called chorea. It is much more common in people of Western European descent than in those of Asian or African ancestry. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation on either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin, which means any child of an affected parent has a 50% risk of inheriting the disease. In the rare situations where both parents have an affected copy, the risk increases to 75%, and when either parent has two affected copies, the risk is 100% (all children will be affected).

This seems to be a good thing to me!\nPerhaps your concern is that the current textual definition stipulates that the disease be CAUSED by the autoimmune process.  On this reading, we probably would not want a neurological disease whose realization includes an autoimmune process that is of only peripheral interest/importance to the disease to be included among the children of 'autoimmune neurological disease'.  In this regard, we might need a more restrictive logical definition in order to capture the intended extension of the current textual definition.  I think that we would need a new relation that captures the proper sort of causation that is at work here.  The relation 'has material basis' captures a sort of causality, but is not applicable to processes.  Perhaps we can develop a similar relation to connect diseases to processes.  Of course, the 'realizes' relation seems to already have a sort of causality built into its meaning so we would need a way to distinguish the two relations.\n-APC", "type": "label"}]}, "superClasses": ["44"], "subClasses": null, "name": "autoimmune neurological disease", "type": "default", "score": 0, "annotation_list": []}, {"id": "55", "iri": "55", "baseIri": "55", "instances": "55", "attributes": "55", "label_IRI-based": "ND_0000182", "label_undefined": "genetic neurological disease", "body": "Genetic neurological disease is a neurological disease caused by a genetic mutation.", "annotations": {"IAO_0000115": [{"identifier": "IAO_0000115", "language": "undefined", "value": "Genetic neurological disease is a neurological disease caused by a genetic mutation.", "type": "label"}], "IAO_0000114": [{"identifier": "IAO_0000114", "language": "undefined", "value": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000123", "type": "iri"}], "IAO_0000411": [{"identifier": "IAO_0000411", "language": "undefined", "value": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000420", "type": "iri"}], "IAO_0000117": [{"identifier": "IAO_0000117", "language": "undefined", "value": "Mark Jensen", "type": "label"}, {"identifier": "IAO_0000117", "language": "undefined", "value": "Alexander P.
