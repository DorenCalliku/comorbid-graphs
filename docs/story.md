### Why to create something like this?
I am a Ms. student of psychology and neuroscience. I am interested in neuro-psychology and related fields, and had difficulties in mentally visualizing the field, and differentiating scopes. Questions that I am trying to answer:  
- What are the main elements in neuropsychology? 
    - Can I automatically discover them through analyzing text and combining it with pre-existing Ontologies?
    - How would one define these elements?
    - Can we use the properties of these elements to understand disorders and pathologies?
- More mental or physical?
    - How to integrate mental-disorders info with neurological and neuro-psychological data?
    - Which kind of tests need to be done?
    - What are the tools available related to this differentiation?
- How do you personalize therapy based on a case data?
    - Is there a best therapy type for depression for a patient A? What about patient B?
    - Can I guess what kind of data do I need to make a better decision?   
    - What are the most problematic `cognitive-schemas` and how to fix them? (analyse therapies and cases)
- **The Comorbidity Problem**
    - If I am treating patient A for X disorder through Y method and they improve, did I actually help, or did I postpone/enhance/solve the underlying problems?
    - Comorbidity of drugs?
    - Comorbidity of therapies?

### Elements
These are the simple descriptors for now, will enrich with time.


- `dispositions`
    - `personality trait`
    - `mental dispositions`
    - `capability`
- `feeling`
    - `response to stimuli`
    - `generated from independent processes`
- `emotion`
    - `categorization process`
    - `types`
- `processes`
    - `bodily processes`
    - `mental processes`
        - `cognitive schema`
        - `representation`
    - `interpersonal processes`
- `result`
    - `behavior`
    - `potentially pathological`
        - `disorders`
        - `diseases`
        - `syndrome`

### Why a new tool

This tool is here to help with:  
- *Informed decision making* on direction of research.
- *Mental Knowledge Graph* to understand where is your contribution and how that impacts.
- *Maintaining dependencies* of information.

Who should use this?
- *mentors* for showing students where they can contribute
- *academicians* doing meta-review, but want a quick-tool before going all-in for an ontology.

What this tool is **not**?
- Ontology-Viewer - we simplify ontologies into hierarchical structures. Check [Other options](#other-options).
- Knowledge-Graph automatic creator.
