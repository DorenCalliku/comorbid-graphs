  body: "Diagnostic Criteria\nA. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been\
    \ present during the same 2-week \n\nperiod and represent a change from previous\
    \ functioning: at least one of the symptoms \nis either (1) depressed mood or\
    \ (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly\
    \ attributable to another medical condition.\n1. Depressed mood most of the day,\
    \ nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec\xAD\n\ntive report (e.g., feels\
    \ sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., \nappears tearful).\
    \ (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)\n\n2. Markedly diminished\
    \ interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the \nday, nearly\
    \ every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).\n\n\n\n\
    3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of\
    \ more than \n5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite\
    \ nearly every day. \n(Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight\
    \ gain.)\n\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n5. Psychomotor agitation\
    \ or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not \n\nmerely subjective\
    \ feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy\
    \ nearly every day.\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate\
    \ guilt (which may be delu\xAD\n\nsional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach\
    \ or guilt about being sick).\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate,\
    \ or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei\xAD\n\nther by subjective account or\
    \ as observed by others).\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying),\
    \ recurrent suicidal ideation with\xAD\n\nout a specific plan, or a suicide attempt\
    \ or a specific plan for committing suicide.\nB. The symptoms cause clinically\
    \ significant distress or impairment in social, occupa\xAD\n\ntional, or other\
    \ important areas of functioning.\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological\
    \ effects of a substance or to another \n\nmedical condition.\nNote: Criteria\
    \ A-C represent a major depressive episode.\nNote: Responses to a significant\
    \ loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a nat\xAD\nural disaster,\
    \ a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense\
    \ sad\xAD\nness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight\
    \ loss noted in Criterion A, \nwhich may resemble a depressive episode. Although\
    \ such symptoms may be understand\xAD\nable or considered appropriate to the loss,\
    \ the presence of a major depressive episode in \naddition to the normal response\
    \ to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This \ndecision inevitably\
    \ requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual\u2019s history\
    \ \nand the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.\u0302\
    \nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by\
    \ schizoaf\xAD\n\nfective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\
    \ delusional disorder, or \nother specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\
    \ and other psychotic disorders.\n\nE. There has never been a manic episode or\
    \ a hypomanie episode.\nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like\
    \ or hypomanic-like episodes \nare substance-induced or are attributable to the\
    \ physiological effects of another med\xAD\nical condition.\n\n\u2019 In distinguishing\
    \ grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in\
    \ \ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE\
    \ it is persistent \ndepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness\
    \ or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is \nlikely to decrease in intensity over\
    \ days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of \ngrief. These waves\
    \ tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The \ndepressed\
    \ mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations.\
    \ \nThe pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are\
    \ uncharacteristic \nof the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of\
    \ MDE. The thought content associated \nwith grief generally features a preoccupation\
    \ with thoughts and memories of the deceased, \nrather than the self-critical\
    \ or pessimistic ruminations seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener\xAD\n\
    ally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are\
    \ common. If self\xAD\nderogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves\
    \ perceived failings vis-\xE0-vis the \ndeceased (e.g., not visiting frequently\
    \ enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was \nloved). If a bereaved\
    \ individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally \nfocused\
    \ on the deceased and possibly about \"joining\" the deceased, whereas in MDE\
    \ such \nthoughts are focused on ending one's own life because of feeling worthless,\
    \ undeserving of life, \nor unable to cope with the pain of depression.\n\n\n\n\
    Coding and Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for major depressive disorder\
    \ is based on whether this is a single or \nrecurrent episode, current severity,\
    \ presence of psychotic features, and remission status. \nCurrent severity and\
    \ psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met \n\
    for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the\
    \ full criteria \nare not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes\
    \ are as follows:\n\nSeverity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode*\n\
    \nMild (p. 188) 296.21 (F32.0) 296.31 (F33.0)\n\nModerate (p. 188) 296.22 (F32.1)\
    \ 296.32 (F33.1)\n\nSevere (p. 188) 296.23 (F32.2) 296.33 (F33.2)\n\nWith psychotic\
    \ features** (p. 186) 296.24 (F32.3) 296.34 (F33.3)\n\nIn partial remission (p.\
    \ 188) 296.25 (F32.4) 296.35 (F33.41)\n\nIn full remission (p. 188) 296.26 (F32.5)\
    \ 296.36 (F33.42)\n\nUnspecified 296.20 (F32.9) 296.30 (F33.9)\n*For an episode\
    \ to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive\
    \ months \nbetween separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major\
    \ depressive episode. The defini\xAD\ntions of specifiers are found on the indicated\
    \ pages.\n**If psychotic features are present, code the \"with psychotic features\"\
    \ specifier irrespective of epi\xAD\nsode severity.\n\nIn recording the name of\
    \ a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major \ndepressive\
    \ disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers,\
    \ \nfollowed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to\
    \ the current \nepisode.\nSpecify:\n\nWith anxious distress (p. 184)\nWith mixed\
    \ features (pp. 184-185)\nWith melancholic features (p. 185)\nWith atypical features\
    \ (pp. 185-186)\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith mood-incongruent\
    \ psychotic features (p. 186)\nWith catatonia (p. 186). Coding note: Use additional\
    \ code 293.89 (F06.1).\nWith p\xE9ripartum onset (pp. 186-187)\nWith seasonal\
    \ pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 187-188)\n\nDiagnostic Features\nThe criterion\
    \ symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to \n\
    be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation.\
    \ De\xAD\npressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being\
    \ present nearly ev\xAD\nery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting\
    \ complaint, and failure to probe for \naccompanying depressive symptoms will\
    \ result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de\xAD\nnied at first but may be elicited\
    \ through interview or inferred from facial expression and \ndemeanor. With individuals\
    \ who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de\xAD\ntermine whether\
    \ the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive \nsymptoms.\
    \ Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psy\xAD\
    \nchomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall\
    \ sever\xAD\nity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt.\n\
    \n\n\nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least\
    \ 2 weeks during \nw\u0302 hich there is either depressed mood or the loss of\
    \ interest or pleasure in nearly all activi\xAD\nties (Criterion A). In children\
    \ and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. \nThe individual\
    \ must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list \n\
    that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity;\
    \ decreased en\xAD\nergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking,\
    \ concentrating, or making deci\xAD\nsions; or recurrent thoughts of death or\
    \ suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To \ncount toward a major depressive\
    \ episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must \nhave clearly worsened\
    \ compared with the person's pre-episode status. The symptoms \nmust persist for\
    \ most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep\xAD\
    \nisode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in\
    \ social, occu\xAD\npational, or other important areas of functioning. For some\
    \ individuals with milder \nepisodes, functioning may appear to be normal but\
    \ requires markedly increased effort.\n\nThe mood in a major depressive episode\
    \ is often described by the person as depressed, \nsad, hopeless, discouraged,\
    \ or \"down in the dumps\" (Criterion Al). In some cases, sadness \nmay be denied\
    \ at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out\
    \ \nthat the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals\
    \ who complain \nof feeling \"blah,\" having no feelings, or feeling anxious,\
    \ the presence of a depressed mood \ncan be inferred from the person's facial\
    \ expression and demeanor. Some individuals em\xAD\nphasize somatic complaints\
    \ (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of \nsadness.\
    \ Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent\
    \ anger, a \ntendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others,\
    \ an exaggerated \nsense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents,\
    \ an irritable or cranky \nmood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood.\
    \ This presentation should be dif\xAD\nferentiated from a pattern of irritability\
    \ when frustrated.\n\nLoss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at\
    \ least to some degree. Individ\xAD\nuals may report feeling less interested in\
    \ hobbies, \"not caring anymore,\" or not feeling any \nenjoyment in activities\
    \ that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family \nmembers\
    \ often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a\
    \ for\xAD\nmerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer\
    \ finds excuses not to \npractice). In some individuals, there is a significant\
    \ reduction from previous levels of sex\xAD\nual interest or desire.\n\nAppetite\
    \ change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ\xAD\
    \nuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and\
    \ may crave \nspecific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite\
    \ changes are severe (in \neither direction), there may be a significant loss\
    \ or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure \nto make expected weight gains\
    \ may be noted (Criterion A3).\n\nSleep disturbance may take the form of either\
    \ difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces\xAD\nsively (Criterion A4). When insomnia\
    \ is present, it typically takes the form of middle in- \nsonrmia (i.e., waking\
    \ up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or \nterminal\
    \ insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial\
    \ in\xAD\nsomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals\
    \ who present with over\xAD\nsleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep\
    \ episodes at night or increased \ndaytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the\
    \ individual seeks treatment is for the dis\xAD\nturbed sleep.\n\nPsychomotor\
    \ changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand- \n\
    wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation\
    \ (e.g., \nslowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before\
    \ answering; \nspeech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety\
    \ of content, or muteness) \n(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation\
    \ must be severe enough to be ob\xAD\nservable by others and not represent merely\
    \ subjective feelings.\n\nDecreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common\
    \ (Criterion A6). A person may re\xAD\nport sustained fatigue without physical\
    \ exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require\n\n\n\nsubstantial effort.\
    \ The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For \nexample,\
    \ an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex\xAD\
    \nhausting and take twice as long as usual.\n\nThe sense of worthlessness or guilt\
    \ associated with a major depressive episode may in\xAD\nclude unrealistic negative\
    \ evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina\xAD\ntions over\
    \ minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral\
    \ \nor trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated\
    \ sense \nof responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or\
    \ guilt may be of delu\xAD\nsional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced\
    \ that he or she is personally re\xAD\nsponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself\
    \ for being sick and for failing to meet \noccupational or inte\u03C6ersonal responsibilities\
    \ as a result of the depression is very common \nand, unless delusional, is not\
    \ considered sufficient to meet this criterion.\n\nMany individuals report impaired\
    \ ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor \ndecisions (Criterion A8).\
    \ They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi\xAD\nculties.\
    \ Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function.\
    \ In \nchildren, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration.\
    \ In elderly individ\xAD\nuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint\
    \ and may be mistaken for early signs \nof a dementia (''pseudodementia\"). When\
    \ the major depressive episode is successfully \ntreated, the memory problems\
    \ often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu\xAD\nlarly elderly\
    \ persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta\xAD\
    \ntion of an irreversible dementia.\n\nThoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or\
    \ suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. \nThey may range from a passive\
    \ wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others \nwould be better\
    \ off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com\xAD\
    \nmitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals\
    \ may have put \ntheir affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts),\
    \ acquired needed materials (e.g., a \nrope or a gun), and chosen a location and\
    \ time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for \nsuicide may include a desire\
    \ to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, \nan intense wish\
    \ to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo\xAD\n\
    tional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not\
    \ be a burden to \nothers. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful\
    \ measure of diminished \nsuicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide.\n\
    \nThe evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult\
    \ \nwhen they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition\
    \ (e.g., cancer, \nstroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of\
    \ the criterion signs and symp\xAD\ntoms of a major depressive episode are identical\
    \ to those of general medical conditions \n(e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes;\
    \ fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg\xAD\nnancy; insonmia later in\
    \ pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a \nmajor depressive\
    \ diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general \n\
    medical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthless\xAD\
    \nness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be\
    \ assessed with \nparticular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive\
    \ episodes that have been mod\xAD\nified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms\
    \ appear to identify nearly the same in\xAD\ndividuals as do the full criteria.\n\
    \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis\nMajor depressive disorder is associated\
    \ with high mortality, much of which is accounted \nfor by suicide; however, it\
    \ is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals ad\xAD\nmitted to\
    \ nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year.\
    \ In\xAD\ndividuals frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding,\
    \ obsessive rumination, \nanxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health,\
    \ and complaints of pain (e.g., head\xAD\naches; joint, abdominal, or other pains).\
    \ In children, separation anxiety may occur.\n\n\n\nAlthough an extensive literature\
    \ exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrino\xAD\nlogical, and neurophysiological\
    \ correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test \nhas yielded results\
    \ of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for\
    \ \nthis disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity\
    \ had been \nthe most extensively investigated abnormality associated v\u0302\
    \ ith major depressive episodes, \nand it appears to be associated with melancholia,\
    \ psychotic features, and risks for eventual \nsuicide. Molecular studies have\
    \ also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic vari\xAD\nants in neurotrophic\
    \ factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, functional \nmagnetic\
    \ resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities in spe\xAD\
    \ncific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion\
    \ regula\xAD\ntion in adults with major depression.\n\nPrevalence\nTwelve-month\
    \ prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately\
    \ \n7%, with marked differences by age group such that the prevalence in 18- to\
    \ 29-year-old indi\xAD\nviduals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals\
    \ age 60 years or older. Females ex\xAD\nperience 1.5- to 3-fold higher rates\
    \ than males beginning in early adolescence.\n\nDevelopment and Course\nMajor\
    \ depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset\
    \ in\xAD\ncreases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears\
    \ to peak in the 20s; \nhowever, first onset in late life is not uncommon.\n\n\
    The course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals\
    \ \nrarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no\
    \ symptoms, or \nonly one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while\
    \ others experience many \nyears with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes.\
    \ It is important to distinguish \nindividuals who present for treatment during\
    \ an exacerbation of a chronic depressive ill\xAD\nness from those whose symptoms\
    \ developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms \nsubstantially increases\
    \ the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance \nuse disorders\
    \ and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symp\xAD\
    \ntom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive\
    \ symp\xAD\ntoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which\
    \ they were entirely free of \ndepressive symptoms.\n\nRecovery typically begins\
    \ within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with ma\xAD\njor depression\
    \ and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong\
    \ \ndeterminant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals\
    \ who have been \ndepressed only for several months can be expected to recover\
    \ spontaneously. Features as\xAD\nsociated with lower recovery rates, other than\
    \ current episode duration, include psychotic \nfeatures, prominent anxiety, personality\
    \ disorders, and symptom severity.\n\nThe risk of recurrence becomes progessively\
    \ lower over time as the duration of re\xAD\nmission increases. The risk is higher\
    \ in individuals whose preceding episode was severe, \nin younger individuals,\
    \ and in individuals who have already experienced multiple epi\xAD\nsodes. The\
    \ persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful\
    \ \npredictor of recurrence.\n\nMany bipolar illnesses begin with one or more\
    \ depressive episodes, and a substantial \nproportion of individuals who initially\
    \ appear to have major depressive disorder will \nprove, in time, to instead have\
    \ a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with \nonset of the illness\
    \ in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family \nhistory\
    \ of bipolar illness. The presence of a \"'with mixed features\" specifier also\
    \ increases \nthe risk for future manic or hypomanie diagnosis. Major depressive\
    \ disorder, particularly \nwith psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia,\
    \ a change that is much \nmore frequent than the reverse.\n\n\n\nDespite consistent\
    \ differences between genders in prevalence rates for depressive disor\xAD\nders,\
    \ there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course,\
    \ or treat\xAD\nment response. Similarly, there are no clear effects of current\
    \ age on the course or treatment \nresponse of major depressive disorder. Some\
    \ symptom differences exist, though, such that \nhypersomnia and hyperphagia are\
    \ more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic \nsymptoms, particularly\
    \ psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals. \nThe likelihood\
    \ of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the risk of com\xAD\
    \npleted suicide does not. Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial\
    \ and more \nlikely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive\
    \ disorder within \nindividuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times\
    \ to recovery appear to be sta\xAD\nble over long periods, and the likelihood\
    \ of being in an episode does not generally increase \nor decrease with time.\n\
    \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nTemperamental. Neuroticism (negative affectivity)\
    \ is a well-established risk factor for the \nonset of major depressive disorder,\
    \ and high levels appear to render individuals more likely \nto develop depressive\
    \ episodes in response to stressful life events.\nEnvironmental. Adverse childhood\
    \ experiences, particularly when there are multiple \nexperiences of diverse types,\
    \ constitute a set of potent risk factors for major depressive dis\xAD\norder.\
    \ Stressful life events are well recognized as pr\xE9cipitants of major depressive\
    \ epi\xAD\nsodes, but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the\
    \ onset of episodes does \nnot appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or\
    \ treatment selection.\nGenetic and physiological. First-degree family members\
    \ of individuals with major de\xAD\npressive disorder have a risk for major depressive\
    \ disorder two- to fourfold higher than \nthat of the general population. Relative\
    \ risks appear to be higher for early-onset and re\xAD\ncurrent forms. Heritability\
    \ is approximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism ac\xAD\ncounts for\
    \ a substantial portion of this genetic liability.\nCourse modifiers. Essentially\
    \ all major nonmood disorders increase the risk of an indi\xAD\nvidual developing\
    \ depression. Major depressive episodes that develop against the back\xAD\nground\
    \ of another disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety,\
    \ \nand borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these, and\
    \ the pre\xAD\nsenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition.\
    \ However, sus\xAD\ntained clinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend\
    \ on the appropriate \ntreatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling\
    \ medical conditions also increase \nrisks for major depressive episodes. Such\
    \ prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity, \nand cardiovascular disease\
    \ are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these epi\xAD\nsodes are more\
    \ likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy \n\
    individuals.\n\nCuiture-Reiated Diagnostic issues\nSurveys of major depressive\
    \ disorder across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold dif\xAD\nferences in 12-month\
    \ prevalence rates but much more consistency in female-to-male raho, \nmean ages\
    \ at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood\
    \ \nof comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural\
    \ differences \nin the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not permit\
    \ simple linkages be\xAD\ntween particular cultures and the likelihood of specific\
    \ symptoms. Rather, clinicians \nshould be aware that in most countries the majority\
    \ of cases of depression go unrecog\xAD\nnized in primary care settings and that\
    \ in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely \nto constitute the presenting\
    \ complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and \nloss of energy are\
    \ the most uniformly reported.\n\n\n\nGender-Related Diagnostic issues\nAlthough\
    \ the m\xF6st reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder\
    \ \nhas been a higher prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between\
    \ genders in \nsymptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences.\
    \ In w\u0302 omen, the risk for \nsuicide attempts is higher, and the risk for\
    \ suicide completion is lower. The disparity in \nsuicide rate by gender is not\
    \ as great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the \npopulation\
    \ as a whole.\n\nSuicide Risic\nThe possibility of suicidal behavior exists at\
    \ all times during major depressive episodes. \nThe most consistently described\
    \ risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats, \nbut it should\
    \ be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by unsuccess\xAD\
    \nful attempts. Other features associated with an increased risk for completed\
    \ suicide \ninclude male sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent\
    \ feelings of hopeless\xAD\nness. The presence of borderline personality disorder\
    \ markedly increases risk for future \nsuicide attempts.\n\nFunctional Consequences\
    \ of \niVlajor Depressive Disorder\nMany of the functional consequences of major\
    \ depressive disorder derive from individual \nsymptoms. Impairment can be very\
    \ mild, such that many of those who interact with the af\xAD\nfected individual\
    \ are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range \nto complete\
    \ incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self\xAD\
    \ncare needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in general medical\
    \ settings, \nthose with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical\
    \ illness and greater de\xAD\ncreases in physical, social, and role functioning.\n\
    \nDifferential Diagnosis\nManic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes.\
    \ Major depressive episodes \nwith prominent irritable mood may be difficult to\
    \ distinguish from manic episodes with \nirritable mood or from mixed episodes.\
    \ This distinction requires a careful clinical evalua\xAD\ntion of the presence\
    \ of manic symptoms.\nMood disorder due to another medical condition. A major\
    \ depressive episode is the \nappropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is\
    \ not judged, based on individual history, \nphysical examination, and laboratory\
    \ findings, to be the direct pathophysiological conse\xAD\nquence of a specific\
    \ medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).\nSubstance/medication-induced\
    \ depressive or bipolar disorder. This disorder is distin\xAD\nguished from major\
    \ depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, \n\
    a medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.\
    \ For ex\xAD\nample, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal\
    \ from cocaine would \nbe diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.\n\
    Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Distractibility and low frustration\
    \ tolerance \ncan occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and\
    \ a major depressive epi\xAD\nsode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity\
    \ disorder may be diag\xAD\nnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the\
    \ clinician must be cautious not to \noverdiagnose a major depressive episode\
    \ in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity \ndisorder whose disturbance\
    \ in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness \nor loss of\
    \ interest.\n\n\n\nAdjustment disorder with depressed mood. A major depressive\
    \ episode that occurs in \nresponse to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished\
    \ from adjustment disorder w\u0302 ith de\xAD\npressed mood by the fact that the\
    \ full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in \nadjustment disorder.\n\
    Sadness. Finally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience.\
    \ \nThese periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless\
    \ criteria are \nmet for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration\
    \ (i.e., most of the day, nearly ev\xAD\nery day for at least 2 w\u0302 eeks),\
    \ and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagno\xAD\nsis other\
    \ specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed\
    \ \nmood wiih clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for\
    \ duration or se\xAD\nverity.\n\nComorbidity\nOther disorders with which major\
    \ depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substance- \nrelated disorders,\
    \ panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, buli\xAD\n\
    mia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder.\n\nPersistent Depressive Disorder\

      \ or disability) may include the feelings of intense sad\xAD\nness, rumination\
      \ about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion\
      \ A, \nwhich may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be\
      \ understand\xAD\nable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of\
      \ a major depressive episode in \naddition to the normal response to a significant\
      \ loss should also be carefully considered. This \ndecision inevitably requires\
      \ the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual\u2019s history \n\
      and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.\u0302\
      \nD. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained\
      \ by schizoaf\xAD\n\nfective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\
      \ delusional disorder, or \nother specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\
      \ and other psychotic disorders.\n\nE. There has never been a manic episode\
      \ or a hypomanie episode.\nNote: This exclusion does not apply if all of the\

      \ to the physiological effects of another med\xAD\nical condition.\n\n\u2019\
      \ In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful\
      \ to consider that in \ngrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness\
      \ and loss, while in MDE it is persistent \ndepressed mood and the inability\
      \ to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is \nlikely to\
      \ decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called\
      \ pangs of \ngrief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders\
      \ of the deceased. The \ndepressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied\
      \ to specific thoughts or preoccupations. \nThe pain of grief may be accompanied\
      \ by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic \nof the pervasive\
      \ unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated\
      \ \nwith grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories\
      \ of the deceased, \nrather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations\
      \ seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener\xAD\nally preserved, whereas in\
      \ MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self\xAD\n\
      derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings\
      \ vis-\xE0-vis the \ndeceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling\
      \ the deceased how much he or she was \nloved). If a bereaved individual thinks\
      \ about death and dying, such thoughts are generally \nfocused on the deceased\
      \ and possibly about \"joining\" the deceased, whereas in MDE such \nthoughts\
      \ are focused on ending one's own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving\
      \ of life, \nor unable to cope with the pain of depression.\n\n\n\nCoding and\
      \ Recording Procedures\nThe diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is\

    \ Features\nThe essential feature of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)\
    \ is a depressed mood \nthat occurs for most of the day, for more days than not,\
    \ for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year \nfor children and adolescents (Criterion\
    \ A). This disorder represents a consolidation of \nDSM-IV-defined chronic major\
    \ depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major de\xAD\npression may precede\
    \ persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may \noccur during\
    \ persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major de\xAD\
    \npressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent\
    \ depressive \ndisorder as well as major depressive disorder.\n\nIndividuals with\
    \ persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or \"down \nin the\
    \ dumps.\" During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms\
    \ from \nCriterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of\
    \ the individual's \nday-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early\
    \ onset (e.g., \"I've always been this\n\n\n\nway\"), they may not be reported\
    \ unless the individual is directly prompted. E>uring the 2-year \nperiod (1 year\
    \ for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than\n\
    2 months (Criterion C).\n\nPrevalence\nPersistent depressive disorder is effectively\
    \ an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and \nchronic major depressive episode.\
    \ The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approxi\xAD\nmately 0.5% for\
    \ persistent depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive disorder.\n\
    \nDevelopment and Course\nPersistent depressive disorder often has an early and\
    \ insidious onset (i.e., in childhood, \nadolescence, or early adult life) and,\
    \ by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals \nwith both persistent depressive\
    \ disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covari\xAD\nance of the corresponding\
    \ features over time suggests the operation of a common mecha\xAD\nnism. Early\
    \ onset (i.e., before age 21 years) is associated with a higher likelihood of\
    \ \ncomorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders.\n\nWhen symptoms\
    \ rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to sub\xAD\n\
    sequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less\
    \ likely to \nresolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive\
    \ disorder than they \nare in a major depressive episode.\n\nRisk and Prognostic\
    \ Factors\nTemperamental. Factors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include\
    \ higher levels \nof neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity,\
    \ poorer global functioning, \nand presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder.\n\
    Environmental. Childhood risk factors include parental loss or separation.\nGenetic\
    \ and physiological. There are no clear differences in illness development, course,\
    \ \nor family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive\
    \ dis\xAD\norder. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore\
    \ likely to apply to per\xAD\nsistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that\
    \ individuals with persistent depressive \ndisorder will have a higher proportion\
    \ of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive \ndisorder than do individuals\
    \ with major depressive disorder, and more depressive disor\xAD\nders in general.\n\
    \nA number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala,\
    \ hip\xAD\npocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive disorder. Possible\
    \ polysomno- \ngraphic abnormalities exist as well.\n\nFunctional Consequences\
    \ of \nPersistent Depressive Disorder\nThe degree to which persistent depressive\
    \ disorder impacts social and occupational func\xAD\ntioning is likely to vary\
    \ widely, but effects can be as great as or greater than those of major \ndepressive\
    \ disorder.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMajor depressive disorder. If there is\
    \ a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms \nmeeting criteria for a persistent\
    \ depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of \npersistent depressive\
    \ disorder is made. The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration, \nwhich distinguishes\
    \ it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom\n\n\n\
    \ncriteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any\
    \ time during this pe\xAD\nriod, then the diagnosis of major depression should\
    \ be noted, but it is coded not as a separate \ndiagnosis but rather as a specifier\
    \ with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the \nindividual's\
    \ symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the\
    \ \nspecifier of \"with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode\"\
    \ would be \nmade. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least\
    \ a 2-year duration and re\xAD\nmains present, then the specifier \"with persistent\
    \ major depressive episode\" is used. When \nfull major depressive episode criteria\
    \ are not currently met but there has been at least one \nprevious episode of\
    \ major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depres\xAD\
    \nsive symptoms, then the specifier of \"with intermittent major depressive episodes,\
    \ without \ncurrent episode\" is used. If the individual has not experienced an\
    \ episode of major depres\xAD\nsion in the last 2 years, then the specifier \"\
    with pure dysthymic syndrome\" is used.\nPsychotic disorders. Depressive symptoms\
    \ are a common associated feature of chronic \npsychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective\
    \ disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A \nseparate diagnosis of persistent\
    \ depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur \nonly during the course\
    \ of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases).\nDepressive or bipolar\
    \ and related disorder due to another medical condition. Persistent \ndepressive\
    \ disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related dis\xAD\
    \norder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar\
    \ and related \ndisorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance\
    \ is judged, based on his\xAD\ntory, physical examination, or laboratory findings,\
    \ to be attributable to the direct patho\xAD\nphysiological effects of a specific,\
    \ usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple \nsclerosis). If it is judged\
    \ that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiolog\xAD\nical\
    \ effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g.,\
    \ persistent \ndepressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is\
    \ noted as a concomitant med\xAD\nical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).\n\
    Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. A substance/medi\xAD\
    \ncation-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from\
    \ persis\xAD\ntent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,\
    \ a medication, a toxin) is \njudged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.\n\
    Personality disorders. Often, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance.\
    \ \nWhen an individual's presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive\
    \ disor\xAD\nder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given.\n\nComorbidity\n\
    In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent\
    \ de\xAD\npressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in\
    \ general, and for anxiety \ndisorders and substance use disorders in particular.\
    \ Early-onset persistent depressive dis\xAD\norder is strongly associated with\

    \ \nand the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal:\
    \ If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance \nand the symptoms develop\
    \ during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\n\nRecording Procedures\nICD-9-CM. The\
    \ name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins \nwith the\
    \ specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing\
    \ \nthe depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included\
    \ in the \ncriteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that\
    \ do not fit into any of the \nclasses (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for ''other\
    \ substance\" should be used; and in cases \nin which a substance is judged to\
    \ be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance \nis unknown, the\
    \ category \"unknown substance\" should be used.\n\nThe name of the disorder is\
    \ followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in\xAD\ntoxication,\
    \ onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, \n\
    which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a\
    \ single\n\n\n\ncode, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the\
    \ substance use disorder. For \nexample, in the qase of depressive symptoms occurring\
    \ during withdrawal in a man with \na severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis\
    \ is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, \nwith onset during withdrawal.\
    \ An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use dis\xAD\norder is also\
    \ given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in\
    \ \nthe development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately\
    \ (e.g.,\n292.84 methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during\
    \ withdrawal;\n292.84 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during\
    \ intoxication).\nICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive\
    \ disorder begins \nwith the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone)\
    \ that is presumed to be causing \nthe depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code\
    \ is selected from the table included in the \ncriteria set, which is based on\
    \ the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid sub\xAD\nstance use disorder.\
    \ For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexameth\xAD\n\
    asone), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which\
    \ a substance is \njudged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of\
    \ substance is unknown, the category \n\"unknown substance\" should be used.\n\
    \nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder\
    \ (if any) is \nlisted first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name\
    \ of the substance-induced de\xAD\npressive disorder, followed by the specification\
    \ of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset \nduring withdrawal). For example,\
    \ in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during with\xAD\ndrawal in a man\
    \ with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use\
    \ \ndisorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal.\
    \ A separate \ndiagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given.\
    \ If the substance-induced \ndepressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance\
    \ use disorder (e.g., after a one-time \nheavy use of the substance), no accompanying\
    \ substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94 \nphencyclidine-induced depressive\
    \ disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than \none substance is\
    \ judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood \nsymptoms,\
    \ each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder\
    \ \nwith methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal;\
    \ F19.94 \ndexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication).\n\
    \nDiagnostic Features\nThe diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced\
    \ depressive disorder include the \nsymptoms of a depressive disorder, such as\
    \ major depressive disorder; however, the de\xAD\npressive symptoms are associated\
    \ with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a sub\xAD\nstance (e.g., drug\
    \ of abuse, toxin, psychotropic medication, other medication), and the \ndepressive\
    \ symptoms persist beyond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxi\xAD\
    \ncation, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical history, physical examination,\
    \ or \nlaboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder should have developed\
    \ during or \nwithin 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing\
    \ the depressive disor\xAD\nder (Criterion Bl). In addition, the diagnosis is\
    \ not better explained by an independent \ndepressive disorder. Evidence of an\
    \ independent depressive disorder includes the de\xAD\npressive disorder preceded\
    \ the onset of ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the \ndepressive disorder\
    \ persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of sub\xAD\n\
    stance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an independent non-substance/\
    \ \nmedication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should\
    \ not be made \nwhen symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\
    \ (Criterion D). The de\xAD\npressive disorder associated with the substance use,\
    \ intoxication, or withdrawal must \ncause clinically significant distress or\
    \ impairment in social, occupational, or other impor\xAD\ntant areas of functioning\
    \ to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E).\n\nSome medications (e.g., stimulants,\
    \ steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics, central nervous \nsystem drugs, dermatological\
    \ agents, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents)\n\n\n\ncan induce depressive\
    \ mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine \nwhether the\
    \ medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or \nwhether\
    \ a primary depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was\
    \ \nreceiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that developed\
    \ within the first \nseveral weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive\
    \ agent) in an individ\xAD\nual with no history of major depressive disorder would\
    \ qualify for the diagnosis of med\xAD\nication-induced depressive disorder. In\
    \ some cases, a previously established condition \n(e.g., major depressive disorder,\
    \ recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally \ntaking a medication\
    \ that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral \ncontraceptives).\
    \ In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the med\xAD\n\
    ication is causative in this particular situation.\n\nA substance/medication-induced\
    \ depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary \ndepressive disorder by\
    \ considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the \nsubstance\
    \ use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or labora\xAD\
    \ntory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to\
    \ the onset of the \ndepressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances\
    \ can be relatively pro\xAD\ntracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can\
    \ last for a long period after the cessation \nof substance use.\n\nPrevalence\n\
    In a nationally representative U.S. adult population, the lifetime prevalence\
    \ of substance/ \nmedication-induced depressive disorder is 0.26%.\n\nDevelopment\
    \ and Course\nA depressive disorder associated with the use of substance (i.e.,\
    \ alcohol, illicit drugs, or a \nprescribed treatment for a mental disorder or\
    \ another medical condition) must have its on\xAD\nset while the individual is\
    \ using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a with\xAD\ndrawal syndrome\
    \ associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive disorder has \nits\
    \ onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of the substance. Once the\
    \ substance \nis discontinued, the depressive symptoms usually remit within days\
    \ to several weeks, de\xAD\npending on the half-life of the substance/medication\
    \ and the presence of a withdrawal \nsyndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond\
    \ the expected time course of withdrawal of \na particular substance/medication,\
    \ other causes for the depressive mood symptoms \nshould be considered.\n\nAlthough\
    \ there are a few prospective controlled trials examining the association of de\xAD\
    \npressive symptoms with use of a medication, most reports are from postmarketing\
    \ sur\xAD\nveillance studies, retrospective observational studies, or case reports,\
    \ making evidence of \ncausality difficult to determine. Substances implicated\
    \ in medication-induced depressive \ndisorder, with varying degrees of evidence,\
    \ include antiviral agents (efavirenz), cardio\xAD\nvascular agents (clonidine,\
    \ guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine), retinoic acid deriva\xAD\ntives (isotretinoin),\
    \ antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anti-migraine agents (triptans), \nantipsychotics,\
    \ hormonal agents (corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin- \nreleasing\
    \ hormone agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation agents (varenicline), and im\xAD\
    \nmunological agents (interferon). However, other potential substances continue\
    \ to emerge \nas new compounds are synthesized. A history of such substance use\
    \ may help increase di\xAD\nagnostic certainty.\n\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\n\
    Temperamental. Factors that appear to increase the risk of substance/medication-\
    \ \ninduced depressive disorder can be conceptualized as pertaining to the specific\
    \ type of \ndrug or to a group of individuals with underlying alcohol or drug\
    \ use disorders. Risk fac\xAD\n\n\n\ntors common to all drugs include history\
    \ of major depressive disorder, history of drug- \ninduced depression, and psychosocial\
    \ stressors.\nEnvironmental, There are also risks factors pertaining to a specific\
    \ type of medication \n(e.g., increased immune activation prior to treatment for\
    \ hepatitis C associated with inter- \nferon-alfa-induced depression); high doses\
    \ (greater than 80 mg/day prednisone-equiva- \nlents) of corticosteroids or high\
    \ plasma concentrations of efavirenz; and high estrogen/ \nprogesterone content\
    \ in oral contraceptives.\nCourse modifiers. In a representative U.S. adult population,\
    \ compared with individuals \nwith major depressive disorder who did not have\
    \ a substance use disorder, individuals \nwith substance-induced depressive disorder\
    \ were more likely to be male, to be black, to \nhave at most a high school diploma,\
    \ to lack insurance, and to have lower family income. \nThey were also more likely\
    \ to report higher family history of substance use disorders and \nantisocial\
    \ behavior, higher 12-month history of stressful life events, and a greater number\
    \ \nof DSM-rV major depressive disorder criteria. They were more likely to report\
    \ feelings of \nworthlessness, insomnia/hypersomnia, and thoughts of death and\
    \ suicide attempts, but \nless likely to report depressed mood and parental loss\
    \ by death before age 18 years.\n\nDiagnostic iViarlcers\nDetermination of the\
    \ substance of use can sometimes be made through laboratory assays \nof the suspected\
    \ substance in the blood or urine to corroborate the diagnosis.\n\nSuicide Risic\n\
    Drug-induced or treatment-emergent suicidality represents a marked change in thoughts\
    \ \nand behavior from the person's baseline, is usually temporally associated\
    \ with initiation of \na substance, and must be distinguished from the underlying\
    \ primary mental disorders.\n\nIn regard to the treatment-emergent suicidality\
    \ associated with antidepressants, a U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)\
    \ advisory committee considered meta-analyses of \n99,839 participants enrolled\
    \ in 372 randomized clinical trials of antidepressants in trials for \nmental\
    \ disorders. The analyses showed that when the data were pooled across all adult\
    \ \nage groups, there was no perceptible increased risk of suicidal behavior or\
    \ ideation. How\xAD\never, in age-stratified analyses, the risk for patients ages\
    \ 18-24 years was elevated, albeit \nnot significantly (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55;\
    \ 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 0.91-2.70). The \nFDA meta-analyses reveal an\
    \ absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational an\xAD\ntidepressants\
    \ of 0.01%. In conclusion, suicide is clearly an extremely rare treatment-emer\xAD\
    \ngent phenomenon, but the outcome of suicide was serious enough to prompt the\
    \ FDA to \nissue an expanded black-box warning in 2007 regarding the importance\
    \ of careful moni\xAD\ntoring of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in patients\
    \ receiving antidepressants.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\nSubstance intoxication\
    \ and withdrawal. Depressive symptoms occur commonly in sub\xAD\nstance intoxicahon\
    \ and substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of the substance-specific \nintoxication\
    \ or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A\
    \ \ndiagnosis of substance-induced depressive disorder should be made instead\
    \ of a diag\xAD\nnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when\
    \ the mood symptoms are \nsufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical\
    \ attention. For example, dysphoric \nmood is a characteristic feature of cocaine\
    \ withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced \ndepressive disorder should be diagnosed\
    \ instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood \ndisturbance is substantially\
    \ more intense or longer lasting than what is usually encountered \nwith cocaine\
    \ withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and\
    \ \ntreatment.\n\n\n\nPrimary depressive disorder. A substance/medication-induced\
    \ depressive disorder is \ndistinguished from a primary depressive disorder by\
    \ the fact that a substance is judged to \nbe etiologically related to the symptoms,\
    \ as described earlier (see section \"Development \nand Course\" for this disorder).\n\
    Depressive disorder due to another medical condition. Because individuals with\
    \ other \nmedical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the\
    \ clinician must consider the \npossibility that the mood symptoms are caused\
    \ by the physiological consequences of the med\xAD\nical condition rather than\
    \ the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another \nmedical condition\
    \ is diagnosed. The history often provides \xDCie primary basis for such a judg\xAD\
    \nment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g.,\
    \ medication sub\xAD\nstitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine\
    \ empirically whether the medication \nis the causative agent. If the clinician\
    \ has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both \nanother medical\
    \ condition and substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i.e., depressive\
    \ \ndisorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced\
    \ depressive \ndisorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to\
    \ determine whether the depres\xAD\nsive symptoms are associated with substance\
    \ (including a medication) ingestion or with\xAD\ndrawal or with another medical\
    \ condition or are primary (i.e., not a function of either a \nsubstance or another\
    \ medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or \n\
    unspecified depressive disorder would be indicated.\n\nComorbidity\nCompared with\
    \ individuals with major depressive disorder and no comorbid substance \nuse disorder,\
    \ those with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder have higher \nrates\
    \ of comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder; are more likely to have specific\
    \ \nDSM-IV disorders of pathological gambling and paranoid, histrionic, and antisocial\
    \ per\xAD\nsonality disorders; and are less likely to have persistent depressive\
    \ disorder (dysthymia). \nCompared with individuals with major depressive disorder\
    \ and a comorbid substance use \ndisorder, individuals with substance/medication-induced\
    \ depressive disorder are more \nlikely to have alcohol use disorder, any other\
    \ substance use disorder, and histrionic per\xAD\nsonality disorder; however,\
    \ they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder.\n\nDepressive Disorder\

    \ is etiologically re\xAD\nlated to the general medical condition through a physiological\

    \ guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a \ntemporal association\
    \ between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical \ncondition\
    \ and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of\
    \ fea\xAD\ntures that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age\
    \ at onset or course or \nabsence of family history). Evidence from the literature\
    \ that suggests that there can be a di\xAD\nrect association between the general\
    \ medical condition in question and the development \nof mood symptoms can provide\
    \ a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation.\n\nAssociated\
    \ Features Supporting Diagnosis\nEtiology (i.e., a causal relationship to another\
    \ medical condition based on best clinical ev\xAD\nidence) is the key variable\
    \ in depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The \nlisting of the\
    \ medical conditions that are said to be able to induce major depression is never\
    \ \ncomplete, and the clinician's best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis.\n\
    \nThere are clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical correlates, of\
    \ depression \nwith stroke, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic\
    \ brain injury. Among \nthe neuroendocrine conditions most closely associated\
    \ with depression are Cushing's dis\xAD\nease and hypothyroidism. There are numerous\
    \ other conditions thought to be associated \nwith depression, such as multiple\
    \ sclerosis. However, the literature's support for a causal \nassociation is greater\
    \ with some conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's \ndisease,\
    \ than with others, for which the differential diagnosis may be adjustment disorder,\
    \ \nwith depressed mood.\n\nDeveiopment and Course\nFollowing stroke, the onset\
    \ of depression appears to be very acute, occurring within 1 day \nor a few days\
    \ of the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the largest case series. However, in\n\
    \n\n\nsome cases, onset of the depression is weeks to months following the CVA.\
    \ In the largest \nseries, the duration of the major depressive episode following\
    \ stroke was 9-11 months on \naverage. Similarly, in Huntington's disease the\
    \ depressive state comes quite early in the \ncourse of the illness. With Parkinson's\
    \ disease and Huntington's disease, it often precedes \nthe major motor impairments\
    \ and cognitive impairments associated with each condition. \nThis is more prominently\
    \ the case for Huntington's disease, in which depression is con\xAD\nsidered to\
    \ be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There is some observational evidence\
    \ \nthat depression is less common as the dementia of Huntington's disease progresses.\n\
    \nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nThe risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder\
    \ following a CVA (within 1 day to a \nweek of the event) appears to be strongly\
    \ correlated with lesion location, with greatest risk \nassociated with left frontal\
    \ strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal \nlesions in\
    \ those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The association with\
    \ \nfrontal regions and laterality is not observed in depressive states that occur\
    \ in the 2-6 months \nfollowing stroke.\n\nGender-Related Diagnostic issues\n\
    Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g.,\
    \ systemic \nlupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat\
    \ more common in \nmiddle-age males compared with females).\n\nDiagnostic iVlarlcers\n\
    Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g.,\
    \ steroid \nlevels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing's\
    \ disease, which can \nbe associated with manic or depressive syndromes).\n\n\
    Suicide Risic\nThere are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence to differentiate\
    \ the risk of sui\xAD\ncide from a major depressive episode due to another medical\
    \ condition compared with the \nrisk from a major depressive episode in general.\
    \ There are case reports of suicides in \nassociation with major depressive episodes\
    \ associated with another medical condition. \nThere is a clear association between\
    \ serious medical illnesses and suicide, particularly \nshortly after onset or\
    \ diagnosis of the illness. Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the \nrisk\
    \ of suicide for major depressive episodes associated with medical conditions\
    \ is not less \nthan that for other forms of major depressive episode, and might\
    \ even be greater.\n\nFunctional Consequences of Depressive Disorder \nDue to\
    \ Another iViedicai Condition\nFunctional consequences pertain to those associated\
    \ with the medical condition. In gen\xAD\neral, it is believed, but not established,\
    \ that a major depressive episode induced by Cush\xAD\ning's disease will not\
    \ recur if the Cushing's disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also \n\
    suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including depressive and\
    \ manic/ \nhypomanie ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring) in some individuals\
    \ with static brain in\xAD\njuries and other central nervous system diseases.\n\
    \nDifferential Diagnosis\nDepressive disorders not due to another medical condition.\
    \ Determination of whether \na medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder\
    \ is causing the disorder depends \non a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive\
    \ episodes prior to the onset of the medical\n\n\n\ncondition, b) the probability\
    \ that the associated medical condition has a potential to pro\xAD\nmote or cause\
    \ a depressive disorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly \n\
    after the onset oi\u0302  worsening of the medical condition, especially if the\
    \ depressive symp\xAD\ntoms remit near the time that the medical disorder is effectively\
    \ treated or remits.\nMedication-induced depressive disorder. An important caveat\
    \ is that some medical con\xAD\nditions are treated with medications (e.g., steroids\
    \ or alpha-interferon) that can induce depres\xAD\nsive or manic symptoms. In\
    \ these cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is \nthe\
    \ best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two\
    \ etiological fac\xAD\ntors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs.\
    \ a substance-induced syndrome).\nAdjustment disorders. It is important to differentiate\
    \ a depressive episode from an ad\xAD\njustment disorder, as the onset of the\
    \ medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could \nbring on either\
    \ an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major dif\xAD\n\
    ferentiating elements are the pervasiveness the depressive picture and the number\
    \ and \nquality of the depressive symptoms that the patient reports or demonstrates\
    \ on the mental \nstatus examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated\
    \ medical conditions is rel\xAD\nevant but largely beyond the scope of the present\
    \ manual.\n\nComorbidity\nConditions comorbid with depressive disorder due to\
    \ another medical condition are those \nassociated with the medical conditions\
    \ of etiological relevance. It has been noted that de\xAD\nlirium can occur before\
    \ or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with a variety \nof medical\
    \ conditions, such as Cushing's disease. The association of anxiety symptoms,\
    \ \nusually generalized symptoms, is common in depressive disorders, regardless\
    \ of cause.\n\nOther Specified Depressive Disorder\n311 (F32.8)\n\nThis category\
    \ applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive \n\
    disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,\
    \ or \nother important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full\
    \ criteria for any of \nthe disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class.\
    \ The other specified depressive \ndisorder category is used in situations in\
    \ which the clinician chooses to communicate the \nspecific reason that the presentation\
    \ does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive \ndisorder. This is done\
    \ by recording \u201Cother specified depressive disorder\u201D followed by the\
    \ \nspecific reason (e.g., \u201Cshort-duration depressive episode\u201D).\n\n\
    Examples of presentations that can be specified using the \u201Cother specified\u201D\
    \ designation \ninclude the following:\n1. Recurrent brief depression: Concurrent\
    \ presence of depressed mood and at least \n\nfour other symptoms of depression\
    \ for 2-13 days at least once per month (not associ\xAD\nated with the menstrual\
    \ cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual \nwhose presentation\
    \ has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder \nand does\
    \ not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder.\n\
    \n2. Short-duration depressive episode (4-13 days): Depressed affect and at least\
    \ four \nof the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated\
    \ with clinically \nsignificant distress or impairment that persists for more\
    \ than 4 days, but less than 14 days, \nin an individual whose presentation has\
    \ never met criteria for any other depressive or \nbipolar disorder, does not\
    \ currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic dis\xAD\norder,\
    \ and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief depression.\n\n3. Depressive\
    \ episode with insufficient symptoms: Depressed affect and at least one \nof the\
    \ other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically\n\
    \n\n\nsignificant distress or impairment tliat persist for at least 2 weeks in\
    \ an individual \nwhose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive\
    \ or bipolar disorder, \ndoes not currently meet active or residual criteria for\
    \ any psychotic disorder, and does \nnot meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive\
    \ disorder symptoms.\n\nUnspecified Depressive Disorder\n311 (F32.9)\n\nThis category\
    \ applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive dis\xAD\
    \norder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,\
    \ or other im\xAD\nportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the\
    \ full criteria for any of the disorders \nin the depressive disorders diagnostic\
    \ class. The unspecified depressive disorder category is \nused in situations\
    \ in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are\
    \ \nnot met for a specific depressive disorder, and includes presentations for\
    \ which there is insuf\xAD\nficient information to make a more specific diagnosis\
    \ (e.g., in emergency room settings).\n\nSpecifiers for Depressive Disorders\n\
    Specify if:\n\nWith anxious distress: Anxious distress is defined as the presence\
    \ of at least two of \nthe following symptoms during the majority of days of a\
    \ major depressive episode or \npersistent depressive disorder (dysthymia):\n\
    1. Feeling keyed up or tense.\n2. Feeling unusually restless.\n3. Difficulty concentrating\
    \ because of worry.\n4. Fear that something awful may happen.\n5. Feeling that\
    \ the individual might lose control of himself or herself.\nSpecify current severity:\n\
    \nIMild: Two symptoms.\n\u25A0Moderate: Three symptoms.\n\u25A0Moderate-severe:\
    \ Four or five symptoms.\nSevere: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.\n\
    \nNote: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar\
    \ and ma\xAD\njor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental\
    \ health settings. High \nlevels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide\
    \ risk, longer duration of ill\xAD\nness, and greater likelihood of treatment\
    \ nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful \nto specify accurately the\
    \ presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment \nplanning and\
    \ monitoring of response to treatment.\nWitli mixed features:\n\nA. At least three\
    \ of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present nearly every \nday during\
    \ the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\n1. Elevated, expansive\
    \ mood.\n2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n3. More talkative than usual\
    \ or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that\
    \ thoughts are racing.\n5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either\
    \ socially, at work or school, or \n\nsexually).\n\n\n\n6. Increased or excessive\
    \ involvement in activities that have a high potential for \npainful consequences\
    \ (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in\xAD\ndiscretions, foolish\
    \ business investments).\n\n7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite\
    \ sleeping less than usual; to be \ncontrasted with insomnia).\n\nB. Mixed symptoms\
    \ are observable by others and represent a change from the per\xAD\nson\u2019\
    s usual behavior.\n\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for\
    \ either mania or hypomania, \nthe diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II\
    \ disorder.\n\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological\
    \ effects of a substance \n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).\n\
    Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found\
    \ \nto be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar\
    \ II disorder. \nAs a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of\
    \ this specifier for treatment \nplanning and monitoring of response to treatment.\n\
    \nWith melancholic features:\n\nA. One of the following is present during the\
    \ most severe period of the current epi\xAD\nsode:\n1. Loss of pleasure in all,\
    \ or almost all, activities.\n2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli\
    \ (does not feel much better, even \n\ntemporarily, when something good happens).\n\
    B. Three (or more) of the following;\n\n1. A distinct quality of depressed mood\
    \ characterized by profound despondency, \ndespair, and/or moroseness or by so-called\
    \ empty mood.\n\n2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.\n3. Early-morning\
    \ awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening).\n4. Marked psychomotor\
    \ agitation or retardation.\n5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.\n6. Excessive\
    \ or inappropriate guilt.\n\nNote: The specifier \u201Cwith melancholic features\u201D\
    \ is applied if these features are present \nat the most severe stage of the episode.\
    \ There is a near-complete absence of the ca\xAD\npacity for pleasure, not merely\
    \ a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reac\xAD\ntivity of mood\
    \ is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked \nbrightening\
    \ of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially\
    \ \n(e.g., up to 20%-^0% of normal for only minutes at a time). The \u201Cdistinct\
    \ quality\u201D of mood \nthat is characteristic of the \u201Cwith melancholic\
    \ features\u201D specifier is experienced as qual\xAD\nitatively different from\
    \ that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed \nmood that is\
    \ described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea\xAD\
    \nson is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always\
    \ pres\xAD\nent and are observable by others.\n\nMelancholic features exhibit\
    \ only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the \nsame individual. They\
    \ are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are \nless likely\
    \ to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are \n\
    more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.\nWith atypical features:\
    \ This specifier can be applied when these features predomi\xAD\nnate during the\
    \ majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode \nor\
    \ persistent depressive disorder.\nA. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in\
    \ response to actual or potential positive \n\nevents).\n\n\n\nB. Two (or more)\
    \ of the following:\n1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.\n2. Hypersomnia.\n\
    3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs).\n4. A long-standing\
    \ pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi\xAD\n\nsodes\
    \ of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational im\xAD\
    \npairment.\n\nC. Criteria are not met for \u201Cwith melancholic features\u201D\
    \ or \u201Cwith catatonia\u201D during the \nsame episode.\n\nNote: \u201CAtypical\
    \ depression\u201D has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction\
    \ \nto the more classical agitated, \u201Cendogenous\u201D presentations of depression\
    \ that were the \nnorm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and\
    \ almost never in ado\xAD\nlescents or younger adults) and today does not connote\
    \ an uncommon or unusual clin\xAD\nical presentation as the term might imply.\n\
    \nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive\
    \ events \n(e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become\
    \ euthymie (not \nsad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances\
    \ remain favorable. \nIncreased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase\
    \ in food intake or by \nweight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended\
    \ period of nighttime sleep or \ndaytime napping that totals at least 10 hours\
    \ of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more \nthan when not depressed). Leaden\
    \ paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or \nweighted down, usually in\
    \ the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at \nleast an hour\
    \ a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical \n\
    features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait\
    \ that has \nan early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection\
    \ sensitivity occurs \nboth when the person is and is not depressed, though it\
    \ may be exacerbated during \ndepressive periods.\nWith psychotic features: Delusions\
    \ and/or hallucinations are present.\n\nWith mood-congruent psychotic features:\
    \ The content of all delusions and hal\xAD\nlucinations is consistent with the\
    \ typical depressive themes of personal inade\xAD\nquacy, guilt, disease, death,\
    \ nihilism, or deserved punishment.\nWith mood-incongruent psychotic features:\
    \ The content of the delusions or hal\xAD\nlucinations does not involve typical\
    \ depressive themes of personal inadequacy, \nguilt, disease, death, nihilism,\
    \ or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture \nof mood-incongruent and\
    \ mood-congruent themes.\n\nWith catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply\
    \ to an episode of depression if cata\xAD\ntonic features are present during most\
    \ of the episode. See criteria for catatonia asso\xAD\nciated with a mental disorder\
    \ (for a description of catatonia, see the chapter \n\u201CSchizophrenia Spectrum\
    \ and Other Psychotic Disorders\u201D).\nWith p\xE9ripartum onset: This specifier\
    \ can be applied to the current or, if full criteria \nare not currently met for\
    \ a major depressive episode, most recent episode of major de\xAD\npression if\
    \ onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks follow\xAD\n\
    ing delivery.\n\nNote: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy\
    \ or postpartum. \nAlthough the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up\
    \ after delivery, be\xAD\ntween 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of\
    \ a major depressive epi\xAD\nsode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months\
    \ following delivery. Fifty percent \nof \u201Cpostpartum\u201D major depressive\
    \ episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, \nthese episodes are referred\
    \ to collectively as p\xE9ripartum episodes. Women with \np\xE9ripartum major\
    \ depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic\n\n\n\nattacl<s.\
    \ Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms \nduring\
    \ pregnancy, as well as the \u201Cbaby blues,\u201D increase the risk for a postpartum\
    \ \nmajor depVessive episode.\n\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either\
    \ with or without psychotic \nfeatures. Infanticide is most often associated with\
    \ postpartum psychotic episodes \nthat are characterized by command hallucinations\
    \ to kill the infant or delusions that \nthe infant is possessed, but psychotic\
    \ symptoms can also occur in severe postpar\xAD\ntum mood episodes without such\
    \ specific delusions or hallucinations.\n\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or\
    \ manic) episodes with psychotic features \nappear to occur in from 1 in 500 to\
    \ 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common \nin primiparous women. The risk\
    \ of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is \nparticularly increased for\
    \ women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also \nelevated for those with\
    \ a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially \nbipolar I\
    \ disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\n\nOnce a woman\
    \ has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk \nof recurrence\
    \ with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum \nepisodes\
    \ must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period, \n\
    which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The postpar\xAD\
    \ntum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine alterations\
    \ and \npsychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of breast-feeding on treatment\
    \ \nplanning, and the long-term implications of a history of postpartum mood disorder\
    \ \non subsequent family planning.\n\nWith seasonal pattern: This specifier applies\
    \ to recurrent major depressive disorder.\nA. There has been a regular temporal\
    \ relationship between the onset of major depres\xAD\n\nsive episodes in major\
    \ depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g., \nin the fall or\
    \ winter).\nNote: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of\
    \ seasonally related \npsychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed\
    \ every winter).\n\nB. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania\
    \ or hypomania) also \noccur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression\
    \ disappears in the spring).\n\nC. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes\
    \ have occurred that demonstrate \nthe temporal seasonal relationships defined\
    \ above and no nonseasonal major de\xAD\npressive episodes have occurred during\
    \ that same period.\n\nD. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above)\
    \ substantially outnum\xAD\nber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that\
    \ may have occurred over the \nindividual\u2019s lifetime.\n\nNote: The specifier\
    \ \u201Cwith seasonal pattern\u201D can be applied to the pattern of major de\xAD\
    \npressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature\
    \ is the \nonset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic\
    \ times of the year. \nIn most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and\
    \ remit in spring. Less commonly, \nthere may be recurrent summer depressive episodes.\
    \ This pattern of onset and remis\xAD\nsion of episodes must have occurred during\
    \ at least a 2-year period, without any non\xAD\nseasonal episodes occurring during\
    \ this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive \nepisodes must substantially\
    \ outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over \nthe individual\u2019s lifetime.\n\
    \nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better\
    \ ex\xAD\nplained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal\
    \ unemployment or \nschool schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in\
    \ a seasonal pattern are often \ncharacterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia,\
    \ overeating, weight gain, and a crav\xAD\ning for carbohydrates. It is unclear\
    \ whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in recur\xAD\nrent major depressive\
    \ disorder or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar \ndisorders group,\
    \ a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than\n\n\
    \n\nin bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or hypomanie\
    \ episodes \nmay also be linked to a particular season.\n\nThe prevalence of winter-type\
    \ seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age, \nand sex. Prevalence increases\
    \ with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of \nseasonality, with\
    \ younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes.\n\nSpecify if:\n\
    In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode\
    \ \nare present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less\
    \ than 2 months \nwithout any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode\
    \ following the end of \nsuch an episode.\nIn full remission: During the past\
    \ 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the \ndisturbance were present.\n\
    \nSpecify current severity:\nSeverity is based on the number of criterion symptoms,\
    \ the severity of those symptoms, \nand the degree of functional disability.\n\
    \nMild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis\
    \ are \npresent, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable,\
    \ and the symp\xAD\ntoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational\
    \ functioning.\nModerate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or\
    \ functional impair\xAD\nment are between those specified for \u201Cmild\u201D\
    \ and \u201Csevere.\u201D\nSevere: The number of symptoms is substantially in\
    \ excess of that required to make \nthe diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms\
    \ is seriously distressing and unmanage\xAD\nable, and the symptoms markedly interfere\
    \ with social and occupational functioning.\n\n\n\nA n x ie ty  diSOrdGrS include\
    \ disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxi\xAD\nety and related\
    \ behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or per\xAD\n\
    ceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat. Obviously,\
    \ these \ntwo states overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated\
    \ with surges of au\xAD\ntonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts\
    \ of immediate danger, and escape \nbehaviors, and anxiety more often associated\
    \ with muscle tension and vigilance in prep\xAD\naration for future danger and\
    \ cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear \nor anxiety is\
    \ reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. Panic attacks feature prominently\
    \ \nwithin the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic\
    \ attacks are not lim\xAD\nited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in\
    \ other mental disorders as well.\n\nThe anxiety disorders differ from one another\
    \ in the types of objects or situations that \ninduce fear, anxiety, or avoidance\
    \ behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Thus, \nwhile the anxiety disorders\
    \ tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be dif\xAD\nferentiated\
    \ by close examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and\
    \ \nthe content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.\n\nAnxiety disorders differ\
    \ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety by being ex\xAD\ncessive or persisting\
    \ beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from tran\xAD\nsient\
    \ fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically\
    \ lasting 6 months \nor more), although the criterion for duration is intended\
    \ as a general guide with allowance \nfor some degree of flexibility and is sometimes\
    \ of shorter duration in children (as in sepa\xAD\nration anxiety disorder and\
    \ selective mutism). Since individuals with anxiety disorders \ntypically overestimate\
    \ the danger in situations they fear or avoid, the primary determina\xAD\ntion\
    \ of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of proportion is made by\
    \ the clinician, \ntaking cultural contextual factors into account. Many of the\
    \ anxiety disorders develop in \nchildhood and tend to persist if not treated.\
    \ Most occur more frequently in females than in \nmales (approximately 2:1 ratio).\
    \ Each anxiety disorder is diagnosed only when the symp\xAD\ntoms are not attributable\
    \ to the physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another \nmedical\
    \ condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder.\n\nThe chapter\
    \ is arranged developmentally, with disorders sequenced according to the \ntypical\
    \ age at onset. The individual with separation anxiety disorder is fearful or\
    \ anxious \nabout separation from attachment figures to a degree that is developmentally\
    \ inappro\xAD\npriate. There is persistent fear or anxiety about harm coming to\
    \ attachment figures and \nevents that could lead to loss of or separation from\
    \ attachment figures and reluctance to go \naway from attachment figures, as well\
    \ as nightmares and physical symptoms of distress. Al\xAD\nthough the symptoms\
    \ often develop in childhood, they can be expressed throughout adult\xAD\nhood\
    \ as well.\n\nSelective mutism is characterized by a consistent failure to speak\
    \ in social situations in \nwhich there is an expectation to speak (e.g., school)\
    \ even though the individual speaks in \nother situations. The failure to speak\
    \ has significant consequences on achievement in aca\xAD\ndemic or occupational\
    \ settings or otherwise interferes with normal social communication.\n\nIndividuals\
    \ with specific phobia are fearful or anxious about or avoidant of circum\xAD\n\
    scribed objects or situations. A specific cognitive ideation is not featured in\
    \ this disorder, \nas it is in other anxiety disorders. The fear, anxiety, or\
    \ avoidance is almost always imme-\n\n\n\ndiately induced by the phobic situation,\
    \ to a degree that is persistent and out of proportion \nto the actual risk posed.\
    \ There are various types of specific phobias: animal; natural envi\xAD\nronment;\
    \ blood-injection-injury; situational; and other situations.\n\nIn social anxiety\
    \ disorder (social phobia), the individual is fearful or anxious about or \navoidant\
    \ of social interactions and situations that involve the possibility of being\
    \ scruti\xAD\nnized. These include social interactions such as meeting unfamiliar\
    \ people, situations in \nwhich the individual may be observed eating or drinking,\
    \ and situations in which the in\xAD\ndividual performs in front of others. The\
    \ cognitive ideation is of being negatively evalu\xAD\nated by others, by being\
    \ embarrassed, humiliated, or rejected, or offending others.\n\nIn panic disorder,\
    \ the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is \npersistently\
    \ concerned or worried about having more panic attacks or changes his or her \n\
    behavior in maladaptive ways because of the panic attacks (e.g., avoidance of\
    \ exercise or of \nunfamiliar locations). Panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense\
    \ fear or intense discomfort \nthat reach a peak within minutes, accompanied by\
    \ physical and/or cognitive symptoms. \nLimited-symptom panic attacks include\
    \ fewer than four symptoms. Panic attacks may be \nexpected, such as in response\
    \ to a typically feared object or situation, or unexpected, meaning \nthat the\
    \ panic attack occurs for no apparent reason. Panic attacks function as a marker\
    \ and \nprognostic factor for severity of diagnosis, course, and comorbidity across\
    \ an array of dis\xAD\norders, including, but not limited to, the anxiety disorders\
    \ (e.g., substance use, depressive \nand psychotic disorders). Panic attack may\
    \ therefore be used as a descriptive specifier for \nany anxiety disorder as well\
    \ as other mental disorders.\n\nIndividuals with agoraphobia are fearful and anxious\
    \ about two or more of the follow\xAD\ning situations: using public transportation;\
    \ being in open spaces; being in enclosed places; \nstanding in line or being\
    \ in a crowd; or being outside of the home alone in other situations. \nThe individual\
    \ fears these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or\
    \ \nhelp might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms\
    \ or other inca\xAD\npacitating or embarrassing symptoms. These situations almost\
    \ always induce fear or anx\xAD\niety and are often avoided and require the presence\
    \ of a companion.\n\nThe key features of generalized anxiety disorder are persistent\
    \ and excessive anxiety \nand worry about various domains, including work and\
    \ school performance, that the indi\xAD\nvidual finds difficult to control. In\
    \ addition, the individual experiences physical symptoms, \nincluding restlessness\
    \ or feeling keyed up or on edge; being easily fatigued; difficulty con\xAD\n\
    centrating or mind going blank; irritability; muscle tension; and sleep disturbance.\n\
    \nSubstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder involves anxiety due to substance\
    \ in\xAD\ntoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment. In anxiety disorder\
    \ due to another \nmedical condition, anxiety symptoms are the physiological consequence\
    \ of another med\xAD\nical condition.\n\nDisorder-specific scales are available\
    \ to better characterize the severity of each anxiety \ndisorder and to capture\
    \ change in severity over time. For ease of use, particularly for in\xAD\ndividuals\
    \ with more than one anxiety disorder, these scales have been developed to have\
    \ \nthe same format (but different focus) across the anxiety disorders, with ratings\
    \ of behav\xAD\nioral symptoms, cognitive ideation symptoms, and physical symptoms\
    \ relevant to each \ndisorder.\n\nSeparation Anxiety Disorder\n"
