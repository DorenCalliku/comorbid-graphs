Types A and B are also called Type I. Types C and D are also known as Type II.\n\nEach type involves different organs and may or may not involve the central nervous system or respiratory system. Each one can cause different symptoms and may occur at different times throughout life, from infancy to adulthood.\n\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\n\nNiemann-Pick disease Type A and B occur when cells in the body lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASM helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell of the body.\n\nIf ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This leads to cell death and makes it hard for organs to work properly. Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities, but higher rates are seen in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jew population.\n\nNiemann-Pick Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and excessive amounts of other lipids in the brain.\n\nThere may be reduced ASM activity in some cells. Type C Niemann-Pick disease has been reported in all ethnic groups but it is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.\n\nType D Niemann-Pick involves a defect that interferes with the movement of cholesterol between brain cells. It is now thought to be a variant of type C. This type of Niemann-Pick disease has only been found in the French Canadian population of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.\n\nThere may also be an adult-onset form of Niemann-Pick disease. It is sometimes referred to as Type E disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nType A usually begins in the first few months of life. Symptoms may include:\n    Abdominal (belly area) swelling within 3 - 6 months\n    Cherry red spot in the eye\n    Feeding difficulties\n    Loss of early motor skills (gets worse over time)\n\nType B symptoms are usually milder and occur in late childhood or adolescence. Abdominal swelling may occur in early childhood, but there is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some patients may have repeated respiratory infections.\n\nType C usually affects school-aged children, but the disease may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood. Symptoms may include:\n    Difficulty moving limbs (dystonia)\n    Enlarged spleen\n    Enlarged liver\n    Jaundice at (or shortly after) birth\n    Learning difficulties and intellectual decline (dementia)\n    Seizures\n    Slurred, irregular speech\n    Sudden loss of muscle tone which may lead to falls (cataplexy)\n    Tremors\n    Trouble moving the eyes up and down (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy)\n    Unsteady gait, clumsiness, walking problems (ataxia)\n\nSymptoms of Type D are similar to Type C.\n\nType E occurs in adults. Symptoms include swelling of the spleen and brain and nervous system (neurological) problems. Little is known about this rare type of Niemann-Pick disease.\n\nSymptoms and disease progression of all forms of Niemann-Pick vary from person to person. Other, more common, diseases may cause symptoms similar to Niemann-Pick.\n\nA person in the early stages of the disease may show only a few symptoms. Not every symptom will be seen in the later stages of the disease.\nSigns and tests\n\nType A and B are diagnosed by measuring the amount of ASM in white blood cells. The test can be done using a blood or bone marrow sample. Such testing can tell who has the disease, but does not reveal who may be carriers. DNA tests can be done to diagnose carriers of Type A and B.\n\nA skin biopsy is usually used to diagnose Type C and Type D Niemann-Pick.

Types A and B are also called Type I. Types C and D are also known as Type II.\n\nEach type involves different organs and may or may not involve the central nervous system or respiratory system. Each one can cause different symptoms and may occur at different times throughout life, from infancy to adulthood.\n\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\n\nNiemann-Pick disease Type A and B occur when cells in the body lack an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). ASM helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell of the body.\n\nIf ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This leads to cell death and makes it hard for organs to work properly. Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities, but higher rates are seen in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jew population.\n\nNiemann-Pick Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and excessive amounts of other lipids in the brain.\n\nThere may be reduced ASM activity in some cells. Type C Niemann-Pick disease has been reported in all ethnic groups but it is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.\n\nType D Niemann-Pick involves a defect that interferes with the movement of cholesterol between brain cells. It is now thought to be a variant of type C. This type of Niemann-Pick disease has only been found in the French Canadian population of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.\n\nThere may also be an adult-onset form of Niemann-Pick disease. It is sometimes referred to as Type E disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nType A usually begins in the first few months of life. Symptoms may include:\n    Abdominal (belly area) swelling within 3 - 6 months\n    Cherry red spot in the eye\n    Feeding difficulties\n    Loss of early motor skills (gets worse over time)\n\nType B symptoms are usually milder and occur in late childhood or adolescence. Abdominal swelling may occur in early childhood, but there is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some patients may have repeated respiratory infections.\n\nType C usually affects school-aged children, but the disease may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood. Symptoms may include:\n    Difficulty moving limbs (dystonia)\n    Enlarged spleen\n    Enlarged liver\n    Jaundice at (or shortly after) birth\n    Learning difficulties and intellectual decline (dementia)\n    Seizures\n    Slurred, irregular speech\n    Sudden loss of muscle tone which may lead to falls (cataplexy)\n    Tremors\n    Trouble moving the eyes up and down (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy)\n    Unsteady gait, clumsiness, walking problems (ataxia)\n\nSymptoms of Type D are similar to Type C.\n\nType E occurs in adults. Symptoms include swelling of the spleen and brain and nervous system (neurological) problems. Little is known about this rare type of Niemann-Pick disease.\n\nSymptoms and disease progression of all forms of Niemann-Pick vary from person to person. Other, more common, diseases may cause symptoms similar to Niemann-Pick.\n\nA person in the early stages of the disease may show only a few symptoms. Not every symptom will be seen in the later stages of the disease.\nSigns and tests\n\nType A and B are diagnosed by measuring the amount of ASM in white blood cells. The test can be done using a blood or bone marrow sample. Such testing can tell who has the disease, but does not reveal who may be carriers. DNA tests can be done to diagnose carriers of Type A and B.\n\nA skin biopsy is usually used to diagnose Type C and Type D Niemann-Pick. Laboratory scientists will watch how the skin cells grow and study how they move and store cholesterol. DNA tests may also be done to look for the two genes that cause Niemann-Pick disease Type C.\n\nOther tests might include:\n    Bone marrow aspiration\n    Liver biopsy (usually not necessary)\n    Slit-lamp eye exam\n    Sphingomyelinase assays\n\nA group of autosomal recessive disorders in which harmful quantities of lipids accumulate in the viscera and the central nervous system.

A protein is described as being amyloid if, due to an alteration in its secondary structure, it takes on a particular aggregated insoluble form, similar to the beta-pleated sheet. Symptoms vary widely depending upon where in the body amyloid deposits accumulate.

A compelling reason for this decision is that the term 'amyloid' is historically applied loosely in the medical literature.

Other clinical signs include excessive lip-smacking, altered gaits, and convulsive collapse.\n\nScrapie is infectious and transmissible among similar animals, and so one of the most common ways to contain scrapie (since it is incurable) is to quarantine and destroy those affected. However, scrapie tends to persist in flocks and can also arise apparently spontaneously in flocks that have not previously had cases of the disease. The mechanism of transmission between animals and other aspects of the biology of the disease are only poorly understood and these are active areas of research. Recent studies suggest that prions may be spread through urine and persist in the environment for decades."}]}, {"id": "849", "iri": "849", "baseIri": "849", "instances": "849", "attributes": "849", "label_IRI-based": "ND_0000158", "label_undefined": "dementia caused by syphilis", "annotations": {"definition": [{"identifier": "IAO_0000115", "language": "undefined", "value": "Infectious dementia caused by syphilis is a neurological disease where cognitive deficits [memory, visual spatial, attention, orientation, exceutive function, functional] occur that represent a decline from previous levels of functioning resulting in dementia caused by a syphilis infection.", "type": "label"}, {"identifier": "IAO_0000115", "language": "undefined", "value": "a slow progressive, destructive infection of the brain and the spinal cord.

On this reading, we probably would not want a neurological disease whose realization includes an autoimmune process that is of only peripheral interest/importance to the disease to be included among the children of 'autoimmune neurological disease'.  In this regard, we might need a more restrictive logical definition in order to capture the intended extension of the current textual definition.  I think that we would need a new relation that captures the proper sort of causation that is at work here.  The relation 'has material basis' captures a sort of causality, but is not applicable to processes.  Perhaps we can develop a similar relation to connect diseases to processes.

People with FD have frequent vomiting crises, pneumonia, problems with speech and movement, difficulty swallowing, inappropriate perception of heat, pain, and taste, as well as unstable blood pressure and gastrointestinal dysmotility. FD does not affect intelligence. Originally reported by Conrad Milton Riley and Richard Lawrence Day in 1949,[2] FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies HSAN.[3] All HSAN are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons.

Dysautonomia can be local, as in reflex sympathetic dystrophy, or generalized, as in pure autonomic failure. It can be acute and reversible, as in Guillain-Barre syndrome, or chronic and progressive.
