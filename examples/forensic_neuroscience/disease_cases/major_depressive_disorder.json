KEVIN BROBSON, President Judge\n            HONORABLE MICHAEL H. WOJCIK, Judge\n            HONORABLE CHRISTINE FIZZANO CANNON, Judge\n\nOPINION NOT REPORTED\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBY JUDGE WOJCIK                                    FILED: December 3, 2021\n\n\n            The City of Harrisburg (Employer) petitions for review of an order of\nthe Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirming an order of a Workers\u2019\nCompensation Judge (WCJ), which granted Allison Shuff (Claimant) total disability\nbenefits for a psychological injury in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), depression, and anxiety, that resulted from an abnormal working condition.\nEmployer contends that the WCJ and the Board erred by finding that Claimant met\nthe required burden of proof that she sustained a compensable psychological injury\nas a result of an abnormal working condition. In the alternative, Employer argues\nthat the WCJ and the Board erred by awarding Claimant benefits from February 3,\n\f2016, when Claimant failed to present competent medical evidence of a disability\nuntil March 21, 2017.        Employer also argues that the WCJ\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s fact witnesses were not supported\nby substantial evidence. Employer further argues that the WCJ and the Board erred\nby considering medical opinions of doctors who did not testify but which were relied\nupon by Employer\u2019s medical expert. Upon review, we affirm.\n             The relevant facts as found by the WCJ are as follows. Claimant began\nworking for Employer as a police officer in January 2010. On January 6, 2016,\nClaimant filed a claim petition alleging that she suffered an injury in the nature of\ndepression and PTSD based on two incidents that occurred in the course and scope\nof her employment. Both incidents involved Claimant\u2019s failure to use a taser on\nalleged perpetrators. Following the second incident, a meeting was held with\nClaimant, other officers in Claimant\u2019s platoon, and Claimant\u2019s supervisors. At the\nmeeting, which was described as a \u201cno-holds-barred meeting,\u201d other officers yelled\nat, swore, and berated Claimant. At this meeting, Officer Marc Hall told Claimant\nthat officers who go outside their platoon, \u201cdon\u2019t stick around for long.\u201d Officers\nHall, Chad McGowan, and Ryan Fetzer yelled at Claimant, called her a liar, and told\nher that she was \u201ctrying to get them fired.\u201d Officer McGowan told Claimant that\nshe was a \u201cfucking liability\u201d and that \u201c85% of her shift doesn\u2019t want to work with\nher.\u201d Officer McGowan told Claimant that he felt \u201cshe kicked him in the balls\u201d by\nher not tasing the suspect. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 501a.\n             After allowing the officers to yell, berate, and curse at Claimant,\nCorporal Galkowski brought the officers to a computer and showed them the video\nof the arrest that occurred during the second incident, and he agreed with Claimant\nthat she acted appropriately in not tasing the suspect. Despite Corporal Galkowski\u2019s\n\n\n                                         2\n\fstatement, the officers continued to yell at and berate Claimant. R.R. at 502a.\nClaimant was placed on administrative duty on August 25, 2015, and attended a\nfitness for duty evaluation, where she was evaluated by Employer\u2019s physician, Dr.\nLouis Laguna, who indicated Claimant was not fit for duty as a police officer.\nFollowing the evaluation, Chief Thomas Carter informed Claimant there were no\nwork activities available for her, Claimant ceased work as of February 3, 2016, and\nhas not returned to work since that date. Id. at 502a-03a.\n               Following hearings on Claimant\u2019s claim petition, the WCJ issued a\ndecision dated February 2, 2018, finding that Claimant suffered a work-related\nmental injury in the form of PTSD, depression, and anxiety as a result of the two\nfailure to tase incidents, which culminated in the no-holds-barred meeting. R.R. at\n454a-63a. Specifically, the WCJ determined that the no-holds-barred meeting where\nClaimant was yelled at by her coworkers constituted an abnormal working condition\nunder the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.1 Id. at 460a-61a. The WCJ ordered\nEmployer to pay Claimant temporary total disability benefits and ongoing medical\ncosts from February 3, 2016, the date on which Claimant received the letter from\nChief Carter indicating she was not fit for duty. Id. at 463a. On June 25, 2019, the\nBoard issued an opinion and order remanding the case to the WCJ to make additional\ncredibility determinations, in particular, as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s fact\nwitnesses, Officer Hall, Sergeant Raymond Lyda, and Captain Deric Moody. Id. at\n486a-95a. By decision dated December 12, 2019, the WCJ made specific credibility\nfindings as to Employer\u2019s fact witnesses, again granted Claimant\u2019s claim petition,\nand ordered Employer to continue payment of Claimant\u2019s ongoing total disability\nbenefits and medical costs as of February 3, 2016. Id. at 499a-508a.\n\n\n      1\n          Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-1041.4, 2501-2710.\n                                               3\n\f            In that decision, the WCJ made the following findings relevant to the\nexistence of an abnormal working condition.\n\n            12. The testimony of Officer Marc Hall concerning his\n            actions, words and conduct at the no-holds-barred meeting\n            is not credible. His testimony that tempers were up and\n            voices were raised contradicts his later testimony that no\n            one was yelling. Officer Hall admitted [that] he yelled at\n            Claimant. Also, he still insisted that Claimant should have\n            \u201cfucking tased the suspect.\u201d He admitted [that] everyone\n            was cursing. He admitted that the \u201cno hold[s] bar[r]ed\u201d\n            meeting did not occur regularly. He admitted [that] the\n            meeting was unusual.\n\n            13. The testimony of Sargent [sic] Raymond Lyda is not\n            credible concerning his testimony that there was no yelling\n            and screaming at the meeting. Further, Sargent [sic]\n            Lyda\u2019s testimony is not credible because [it] is\n            extraordinary and unusual for a supervisor to allow yelling\n            and berating of an officer by fellow officers after she was\n            exonerated by the video of the tasing incident. Sergeant\n            Lyda admitted to the meeting as a \u201cno-hold[s]-barred\u201d\n            meeting and acknowledges that officer McGowan told\n            Claimant [that] she was a \u201cfucking liability and [that] 85%\n            of the police force didn\u2019t want to work with her.\u201d\n\n            14. The testimony of Captain Deric Moody is not credible\n            as to whether a no-holds-barred meeting was acceptable\n            conduct for a police department concerning a meeting\n            [that] he did not even know about at the time [that] it was\n            held. Captain Moody testified [that] he found out about\n            the \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d meeting after it occurred.\n\n                                      ***\n\n            41. This Judge finds [that] the scheduling of a \u201cno-holds-\n            barred\u201d meeting under these circumstances, is an\n            extraordinary and unusual event and [that] it constituted\n            an abnormal working condition. This meeting was [the]\n            last of a series of events that created\n            psychiatric/psychological injury to the Claimant.\n\n                                        4\n\f                42. The testimony of the Claimant is found to be credible\n                and the Claimant has been unable to work since February\n                4, 2016.\n\nR.R. at 502a, 504a.\n                Employer appealed the WCJ\u2019s second decision to the Board, on the\nbasis that the WCJ erred by finding that Claimant sustained a compensable work\ninjury under the Act. On October 15, 2020, the Board affirmed the WCJ\u2019s second\ndecision. Employer then petitioned this Court for review.2\n                In addition to the Court\u2019s usual review in a workers\u2019 compensation\nmatter,3 when the case involves a mental-mental injury,4 we must also consider\nwhether Claimant sustained her burden to prove that the mental injury she suffered\nis something other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions, i.e., that\n\n       2\n         Employer requested supersedeas from the Board, which was denied. R.R. at 562a-73a.\nEmployer then sought supersedeas from this Court, which was denied in a Memorandum and Order\ndated January 20, 2021.\n\n       3\n         Our scope of review in a workers\u2019 compensation appeal is limited to determining whether\nan error of law was committed, whether constitutional rights were violated, or whether necessary\nfindings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Bloom v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal\nBoard (Keystone Pretzel Bakery), 677 A.2d 1314, 1318 n.4 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1996). Substantial\nevidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\na conclusion. Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Skirpan), 612\nA.2d 434, 436 (Pa. 1992).\n\n       4\n           As the Supreme Court has explained:\n\n                       For purposes of determining compensation under the Act,\n                mental or psychic injuries are divided into three categories: mental-\n                mental, whereby a mental or psychic condition is caused by a\n                psychic stimulus; mental-physical, whereby psychic injury\n                manifests itself in some physical form; and physical-mental,\n                whereby a physical injury results in psychic distress.\n\nPayes v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania State Police), 79 A.3d 543, 550\n(Pa. 2013). Here, Claimant is asserting a mental-mental injury.\n                                                 5\n\fClaimant\u2019s mental injury is a result of abnormal working conditions. Payes v.\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania State Police), 79 A.3d 543\n(Pa. 2013); Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal\nBoard (Kochanowicz), 108 A.3d 922 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014). In Payes, the Supreme\nCourt held that a state police trooper sustained his burden of proving that an\nabnormal working condition existed and that he was entitled to benefits for a mental-\nmental injury when he accidentally struck and killed a pedestrian with his police car,\nattempted to revive her, and attempted to divert traffic from hitting him and the\npedestrian.   Payes, 79 A.3d at 556-57.        As our Supreme Court stated, the\ndetermination of whether Claimant\u2019s mental injury is a result of abnormal working\nconditions is a mixed question of law and fact. Id. at 549. Mental or psychic injuries\nare highly fact sensitive, and for the actual working conditions to be considered\nabnormal, they must be considered in the context of specific employment. Id. at\n552. Such a fact-sensitive inquiry \u201c\u2018requires deference to the fact-finding functions\nof the WCJ,\u2019\u201d and, therefore, review of those factual findings is limited to\ndetermining whether they are supported by substantial evidence, and they may only\nbe overturned \u201c\u2018if they are arbitrary and capricious. Thus, . . . appellate review of\nthis question [is] a two-step process of reviewing the factual findings and then the\nlegal conclusion.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v. Workers\u2019\nCompensation Appeal Board (Hopton), 912 A.2d, 1278, 1284 n.6 (Pa. 2007)).\n              Here, Employer argues that the WCJ and the Board erred in finding that\nbeing yelled at by co-workers or supervisors at a meeting constituted an abnormal\nworking condition, citing Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s\nCompensation Appeal Board (Guaracino), 675 A.2d 1213 (Pa. 1996) (single episode\nof criticism which included profanity and which occurred outside the presence of\n\n\n                                          6\n\fcoworkers does not constitute an abnormal working condition). Employer also\nargues that what occurred at the meeting did not rise to an abnormal working\ncondition, especially for police officers, whose employment is by nature highly\nstressful. In further support, Employer cites Rydzewski v. Workers\u2019 Compensation\nAppeal Board (City of Philadelphia), 767 A.2d 13 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001), and Young\nv. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (New Sewickley Police Department), 737\nA.2d 317 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).              In Rydzewski, our Court held that a City of\nPhiladelphia police officer was not subjected to abnormal working conditions and\ncould not recover for a mental-mental injury when he witnessed two fellow officers\nget shot, one who later died and one who lived and was paralyzed. Our Court held\nthat \u201c[c]laimant did not prove he experienced a working condition that was\nparticularly abnormal for a person in his line of work.\u201d Rydzewski, 767 A.2d at 16.\n               In Young, our Court held that a police officer was not subjected to\nabnormal working conditions and could not recover for a mental-mental injury when\nhe served an arrest warrant in a domestic violence case, the subject threatened the\nclaimant and himself with a gun, but was later subdued and taken into custody. The\nCourt held that the claimant failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that the\n\u201cstand-off event was an abnormal working condition for a police officer, where\ncertain stressful and even life-threatening events and occurrences are expected\u201d due\nto the nature of the employment. Young, 737 A.2d at 322. Employer also relies on\nGriffin v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Luzerne County Children and\nYouth) (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1956 C.D. 2016, filed January 4, 2018),5 where this Court\nheld that a caseworker was properly denied benefits for a mental-mental injury when\n\n       5\n         See Pa.R.A.P. 126(b) (\u201cAs used in this rule, \u2018non-precedential decision\u2019 refers to . . . an\nunreported memorandum opinion of the Commonwealth Court filed after January 15, 2008.\n[]Non-precedential decisions . . . may be cited for their persuasive value.\u201d).\n                                                 7\n\fa child on her caseload was later killed while in her parent\u2019s custody. Relying on\nthe facts as found by the WCJ, this Court held that such an event was not an abnormal\nworking condition for a caseworker, and because the caseworker did not directly\nexperience a traumatic event at work, this case was distinguishable from Payes and\nKochanowicz. Griffin, slip op. at 6.\n             Claimant responds that Employer\u2019s reliance on Philadelphia\nNewspapers, Rydzewski, and Young is misplaced because all three cases were\ndecided before our Supreme Court decided Payes, which set forth a new analysis of\nmental-mental cases under the Act. Claimant argues that the WCJ did not err in his\nfindings or conclusion that Claimant suffered a compensable mental-mental injury,\nwhere the WCJ found that the two arrest incidents followed by the no-holds-barred\nmeeting were abnormal working conditions. Claimant argues that the WCJ properly\nfound that Employer\u2019s holding such a meeting, and how it conducted the meeting,\nwas an abnormal working condition even for an individual working as a police\nofficer.\n             We cannot conclude that the WCJ erred in finding \u201cthe scheduling of a\n\u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 meeting under these circumstances, is an extraordinary and\nunusual event and it constituted an abnormal working condition. This meeting was\n[the] last of a series of events that created a psychiatric/psychological injury to the\nClaimant.\u201d R.R. at 504a. The WCJ found Claimant credible when she testified that\nshe had never heard about a no-holds-barred meeting being held before, and that\nsuch meetings were not a part of police procedure. Id. at 325a. Officer Hall admitted\nthat no-holds-barred meetings did not occur regularly and that the meeting was\nunusual. Id. at 324a, 325a. In the memorandum prepared following the meeting,\nSergeant Lyda stated that other officers commented \u201cthis was the first time that\n\n\n                                          8\n\fsomething like this (room discussion) has ever taken place,\u201d thus admitting the\nmeeting was unusual. Id. at 31a. These facts, found by the WCJ and supported by\nthe record, support the WCJ\u2019s legal conclusion that under Payes,\n\n               [t]he actions and conduct of the officers of the City of\n               Harrisburg were extraordinary and unusual towards the\n               Claimant and created an abnormal work condition. The\n               holding of a \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d meeting is an extraordinary\n               and unusual event for any organization that has a chain of\n               command. The holding of such a meeting is an abnormal\n               working condition.\nId. at 505a.\n               Here, the WCJ found that an abnormal working condition existed when\ntwo arrests occurred where Claimant was criticized by other officers for not using\nher taser, followed by a no-holds-barred meeting that lasted about an hour, where\nClaimant was berated, and where her supervisors stated that the video of the incident\nshowed that she acted appropriately, but then allowed officers to continue berating\nher. The WCJ found Claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible that the prior failure-to-\ntase incidents, culminating in the no-holds-barred meeting, caused her to fear that\nshe would not be backed up by other officers. R.R. at 264a. Claimant\u2019s reaction\nwas not merely based on her perceptions, but on statements made by her fellow\nofficers, which included that \u201cshe was a fucking liability,\u201d and that \u201c85% of the\nplatoon didn\u2019t want to work with her.\u201d Id. at 347a. We recognize that the finding\nof an abnormal working condition is \u201chighly fact sensitive\u201d and \u201cmust be considered\nin the context of specific employment.\u201d Payes, 79 A.3d at 552. Even so, we\nconclude that the WCJ did not err when he found that the events described here were\nan abnormal working condition, even for a police officer whose employment\nrequires her to work in a very stressful environment.\n\n\n                                           9\n\f             Employer further argues that the WCJ erred by awarding Claimant\nbenefits from February 3, 2016, the date when Employer notified Claimant that she\nwas unfit for duty. Rather, Employer argues that if benefits are awarded, they should\nbegin on March 21, 2017, the date when Dr. Christian Kcomt (Claimant\u2019s expert)\nbegan treating Claimant. Employer argues that Claimant failed to present competent\nmedical evidence that as of February 3, 2016, she has a psychological condition and\nthat the condition was caused by her employment. Employer correctly argues that\nClaimant has the burden to prove that she has a psychological condition that was\ncaused by her employment. Lowe v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\n(Lowes Auto Sales, Inc.), 619 A.2d 411, 414 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1992). However, we\ncannot agree that the WCJ and the Board erred by awarding Claimant benefits from\nFebruary 3, 2016.\n             Claimant\u2019s expert, a board-certified psychiatrist, began treating\nClaimant on March 21, 2017, when he took over Claimant\u2019s treatment after her prior\ntreating physician, Dr. John Mira, retired due to health issues. R.R. at 432a.\nClaimant\u2019s expert testified by deposition that Claimant suffered from major\ndepressive disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and an eating disorder in remission,\nand that she was unable to perform the job duties of a police officer due to the\npotential for mental health decompensation. Id. at 181a-82a. Claimant\u2019s expert\nbegan treating Claimant on March 21, 2017, and he admitted that he was unable to\nrender an opinion as to her diagnosis or her ability to return to work before he met\nher. Id. at 188a. However, Claimant\u2019s expert further testified that he reviewed her\nmedical records, including those from her prior treating physician, after which he\nopined, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Claimant\u2019s\npsychological conditions were \u201cdue to direct issues because of what she experienced\n\n\n                                         10\n\fas a police officer,\u201d which the WCJ found to be credible. Id. at 186a, 504a. Based\non this evidence, we agree with the Board that \u201csubstantial, competent evidence\nsupports [that] Claimant\u2019s work-related medical condition disabled her from\nworking as a police officer for [Employer] as of February 3, 2016.\u201d Id. at 543a.\n             Employer next argues that the WCJ erred in determining its fact\nwitnesses were not credible, specifically, Officer Hall, Sergeant Lyda, and Captain\nMoody, because those credibility determinations are not supported by substantial\nevidence. R.R. at 502a. Employer then attempts to point out specific pieces of\ntestimony from these fact witnesses which, it argues, demonstrate that the WCJ\u2019s\ncredibility determinations lack substantial evidence. This argument is misplaced. In\nworkers\u2019 compensation cases, \u201cthe WCJ is the ultimate fact-finder who must\ndetermine credibility and evidentiary weight. In this role, the WCJ freely evaluates\nthe evidence offered and can accept or reject any witness\u2019 testimony, in whole or in\npart, including that of medical witnesses.\u201d Davis v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal\nBoard (City of Philadelphia), 753 A.2d 905, 909 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2000). As this Court\nfurther stated, \u201c[w]hile this Court can and should consider the competency and\nsufficiency of evidence presented before a WCJ, the WCJ\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility is not subject to our review on appeal.\u201d Id. Therefore, we find that the\nWCJ did not err when, on remand, he made specific credibility determinations as to\nEmployer\u2019s fact witnesses, based on inconsistencies within their testimony,\nparticularly since it was specifically directed to do so by the Board.\n             Finally, Employer argues that the WCJ erred by considering hearsay\nmedical reports relied on by its expert, Dr. D. Gladys Fenichel (Employer\u2019s expert).\nEmployer argues that the WCJ erred in considering reports from Claimant\u2019s prior\ntreating physician, from Employer\u2019s physician Dr. Louis Laguna, and from the\n\n\n                                          11\n\fRenfrew Center, where Claimant received in-patient treatment, when those\nindividuals did not testify and were not subject to cross-examination, and when\nEmployer objected to those reports as hearsay. Employer is correct in asserting that\nhearsay evidence, properly objected to, is not competent evidence to support a\nfinding of fact. Flanagan v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (U.S. Steel\nCorporation), 598 A.2d 613, 615 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1991). Here, however, the WCJ did\nnot rely on these hearsay expert reports to make findings about their opinions, but to\nmake a credibility determination as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s expert.\n             Employer\u2019s expert testified that Claimant\u2019s disability was not causally\nrelated to her employment, based on one meeting with Claimant, and based on\nmedical reports from Claimant\u2019s past treatment providers, which were attached as\nexhibits to her deposition testimony, and on the report of Claimant\u2019s expert. R.R. at\n33a-126a. The WCJ found the testimony of Claimant\u2019s expert to be credible, but\ngave less weight to Employer\u2019s expert \u201cbecause she has evaluated the Claimant one\ntime.   The testimony of [Claimant\u2019s expert] is not credible because she was\ncontradicted by multiple medical providers, whose reports and records she had\nreviewed and commented on.\u201d Id. at 504a. The WCJ also found that the procedure\nof asking Employer\u2019s expert \u201cto comment on other doctor\u2019s medical reports and\nrecords waives any objection that [Employer] may have to discussion of those in the\ndeposition or consideration of those exhibits by this Court.\u201d Id. at 503a.\n             As this Court stated,\n\n             it has long been held that a medical witness may express\n             an opinion based upon medical records of others even if\n             those records were not introduced into evidence so long as\n             they are the kind of records upon which the medical\n             professional customarily relies in the practice of their\n             profession.\n\n                                         12\n\fMithani v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Mt. Airy Lodge), 730 A.2d 566,\n569 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).       Here, we cannot conclude that the WCJ erred in\nconsidering the medical reports reviewed by Employer\u2019s expert, which were\nattached as exhibits to her deposition testimony, to make a credibility determination,\nwhen it is customary for a medical expert to review such reports, and when Employer\nasked its expert to comment on these reports.\n             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Board\u2019s order.\n\n\n\n\n                                       MICHAEL H.

KEVIN BROBSON, President Judge\n            HONORABLE MICHAEL H. WOJCIK, Judge\n            HONORABLE CHRISTINE FIZZANO CANNON, Judge\n\nOPINION NOT REPORTED\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBY JUDGE WOJCIK                                    FILED: December 3, 2021\n\n\n            The City of Harrisburg (Employer) petitions for review of an order of\nthe Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirming an order of a Workers\u2019\nCompensation Judge (WCJ), which granted Allison Shuff (Claimant) total disability\nbenefits for a psychological injury in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), depression, and anxiety, that resulted from an abnormal working condition.\nEmployer contends that the WCJ and the Board erred by finding that Claimant met\nthe required burden of proof that she sustained a compensable psychological injury\nas a result of an abnormal working condition. In the alternative, Employer argues\nthat the WCJ and the Board erred by awarding Claimant benefits from February 3,\n\f2016, when Claimant failed to present competent medical evidence of a disability\nuntil March 21, 2017.        Employer also argues that the WCJ\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s fact witnesses were not supported\nby substantial evidence. Employer further argues that the WCJ and the Board erred\nby considering medical opinions of doctors who did not testify but which were relied\nupon by Employer\u2019s medical expert. Upon review, we affirm.\n             The relevant facts as found by the WCJ are as follows. Claimant began\nworking for Employer as a police officer in January 2010. On January 6, 2016,\nClaimant filed a claim petition alleging that she suffered an injury in the nature of\ndepression and PTSD based on two incidents that occurred in the course and scope\nof her employment. Both incidents involved Claimant\u2019s failure to use a taser on\nalleged perpetrators. Following the second incident, a meeting was held with\nClaimant, other officers in Claimant\u2019s platoon, and Claimant\u2019s supervisors. At the\nmeeting, which was described as a \u201cno-holds-barred meeting,\u201d other officers yelled\nat, swore, and berated Claimant. At this meeting, Officer Marc Hall told Claimant\nthat officers who go outside their platoon, \u201cdon\u2019t stick around for long.\u201d Officers\nHall, Chad McGowan, and Ryan Fetzer yelled at Claimant, called her a liar, and told\nher that she was \u201ctrying to get them fired.\u201d Officer McGowan told Claimant that\nshe was a \u201cfucking liability\u201d and that \u201c85% of her shift doesn\u2019t want to work with\nher.\u201d Officer McGowan told Claimant that he felt \u201cshe kicked him in the balls\u201d by\nher not tasing the suspect. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 501a.\n             After allowing the officers to yell, berate, and curse at Claimant,\nCorporal Galkowski brought the officers to a computer and showed them the video\nof the arrest that occurred during the second incident, and he agreed with Claimant\nthat she acted appropriately in not tasing the suspect. Despite Corporal Galkowski\u2019s\n\n\n                                         2\n\fstatement, the officers continued to yell at and berate Claimant. R.R. at 502a.\nClaimant was placed on administrative duty on August 25, 2015, and attended a\nfitness for duty evaluation, where she was evaluated by Employer\u2019s physician, Dr.\nLouis Laguna, who indicated Claimant was not fit for duty as a police officer.\nFollowing the evaluation, Chief Thomas Carter informed Claimant there were no\nwork activities available for her, Claimant ceased work as of February 3, 2016, and\nhas not returned to work since that date. Id. at 502a-03a.\n               Following hearings on Claimant\u2019s claim petition, the WCJ issued a\ndecision dated February 2, 2018, finding that Claimant suffered a work-related\nmental injury in the form of PTSD, depression, and anxiety as a result of the two\nfailure to tase incidents, which culminated in the no-holds-barred meeting. R.R. at\n454a-63a. Specifically, the WCJ determined that the no-holds-barred meeting where\nClaimant was yelled at by her coworkers constituted an abnormal working condition\nunder the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.1 Id. at 460a-61a. The WCJ ordered\nEmployer to pay Claimant temporary total disability benefits and ongoing medical\ncosts from February 3, 2016, the date on which Claimant received the letter from\nChief Carter indicating she was not fit for duty. Id. at 463a. On June 25, 2019, the\nBoard issued an opinion and order remanding the case to the WCJ to make additional\ncredibility determinations, in particular, as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s fact\nwitnesses, Officer Hall, Sergeant Raymond Lyda, and Captain Deric Moody. Id. at\n486a-95a. By decision dated December 12, 2019, the WCJ made specific credibility\nfindings as to Employer\u2019s fact witnesses, again granted Claimant\u2019s claim petition,\nand ordered Employer to continue payment of Claimant\u2019s ongoing total disability\nbenefits and medical costs as of February 3, 2016. Id. at 499a-508a.\n\n\n      1\n          Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-1041.4, 2501-2710.\n                                               3\n\f            In that decision, the WCJ made the following findings relevant to the\nexistence of an abnormal working condition.\n\n            12. The testimony of Officer Marc Hall concerning his\n            actions, words and conduct at the no-holds-barred meeting\n            is not credible. His testimony that tempers were up and\n            voices were raised contradicts his later testimony that no\n            one was yelling. Officer Hall admitted [that] he yelled at\n            Claimant. Also, he still insisted that Claimant should have\n            \u201cfucking tased the suspect.\u201d He admitted [that] everyone\n            was cursing. He admitted that the \u201cno hold[s] bar[r]ed\u201d\n            meeting did not occur regularly. He admitted [that] the\n            meeting was unusual.\n\n            13. The testimony of Sargent [sic] Raymond Lyda is not\n            credible concerning his testimony that there was no yelling\n            and screaming at the meeting. Further, Sargent [sic]\n            Lyda\u2019s testimony is not credible because [it] is\n            extraordinary and unusual for a supervisor to allow yelling\n            and berating of an officer by fellow officers after she was\n            exonerated by the video of the tasing incident. Sergeant\n            Lyda admitted to the meeting as a \u201cno-hold[s]-barred\u201d\n            meeting and acknowledges that officer McGowan told\n            Claimant [that] she was a \u201cfucking liability and [that] 85%\n            of the police force didn\u2019t want to work with her.\u201d\n\n            14. The testimony of Captain Deric Moody is not credible\n            as to whether a no-holds-barred meeting was acceptable\n            conduct for a police department concerning a meeting\n            [that] he did not even know about at the time [that] it was\n            held. Captain Moody testified [that] he found out about\n            the \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d meeting after it occurred.\n\n                                      ***\n\n            41. This Judge finds [that] the scheduling of a \u201cno-holds-\n            barred\u201d meeting under these circumstances, is an\n            extraordinary and unusual event and [that] it constituted\n            an abnormal working condition. This meeting was [the]\n            last of a series of events that created\n            psychiatric/psychological injury to the Claimant.\n\n                                        4\n\f                42. The testimony of the Claimant is found to be credible\n                and the Claimant has been unable to work since February\n                4, 2016.\n\nR.R. at 502a, 504a.\n                Employer appealed the WCJ\u2019s second decision to the Board, on the\nbasis that the WCJ erred by finding that Claimant sustained a compensable work\ninjury under the Act. On October 15, 2020, the Board affirmed the WCJ\u2019s second\ndecision. Employer then petitioned this Court for review.2\n                In addition to the Court\u2019s usual review in a workers\u2019 compensation\nmatter,3 when the case involves a mental-mental injury,4 we must also consider\nwhether Claimant sustained her burden to prove that the mental injury she suffered\nis something other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions, i.e., that\n\n       2\n         Employer requested supersedeas from the Board, which was denied. R.R. at 562a-73a.\nEmployer then sought supersedeas from this Court, which was denied in a Memorandum and Order\ndated January 20, 2021.\n\n       3\n         Our scope of review in a workers\u2019 compensation appeal is limited to determining whether\nan error of law was committed, whether constitutional rights were violated, or whether necessary\nfindings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Bloom v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal\nBoard (Keystone Pretzel Bakery), 677 A.2d 1314, 1318 n.4 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1996). Substantial\nevidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\na conclusion. Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Skirpan), 612\nA.2d 434, 436 (Pa. 1992).\n\n       4\n           As the Supreme Court has explained:\n\n                       For purposes of determining compensation under the Act,\n                mental or psychic injuries are divided into three categories: mental-\n                mental, whereby a mental or psychic condition is caused by a\n                psychic stimulus; mental-physical, whereby psychic injury\n                manifests itself in some physical form; and physical-mental,\n                whereby a physical injury results in psychic distress.\n\nPayes v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania State Police), 79 A.3d 543, 550\n(Pa. 2013). Here, Claimant is asserting a mental-mental injury.\n                                                 5\n\fClaimant\u2019s mental injury is a result of abnormal working conditions. Payes v.\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania State Police), 79 A.3d 543\n(Pa. 2013); Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal\nBoard (Kochanowicz), 108 A.3d 922 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014). In Payes, the Supreme\nCourt held that a state police trooper sustained his burden of proving that an\nabnormal working condition existed and that he was entitled to benefits for a mental-\nmental injury when he accidentally struck and killed a pedestrian with his police car,\nattempted to revive her, and attempted to divert traffic from hitting him and the\npedestrian.   Payes, 79 A.3d at 556-57.        As our Supreme Court stated, the\ndetermination of whether Claimant\u2019s mental injury is a result of abnormal working\nconditions is a mixed question of law and fact. Id. at 549. Mental or psychic injuries\nare highly fact sensitive, and for the actual working conditions to be considered\nabnormal, they must be considered in the context of specific employment. Id. at\n552. Such a fact-sensitive inquiry \u201c\u2018requires deference to the fact-finding functions\nof the WCJ,\u2019\u201d and, therefore, review of those factual findings is limited to\ndetermining whether they are supported by substantial evidence, and they may only\nbe overturned \u201c\u2018if they are arbitrary and capricious. Thus, . . . appellate review of\nthis question [is] a two-step process of reviewing the factual findings and then the\nlegal conclusion.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v. Workers\u2019\nCompensation Appeal Board (Hopton), 912 A.2d, 1278, 1284 n.6 (Pa. 2007)).\n              Here, Employer argues that the WCJ and the Board erred in finding that\nbeing yelled at by co-workers or supervisors at a meeting constituted an abnormal\nworking condition, citing Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s\nCompensation Appeal Board (Guaracino), 675 A.2d 1213 (Pa. 1996) (single episode\nof criticism which included profanity and which occurred outside the presence of\n\n\n                                          6\n\fcoworkers does not constitute an abnormal working condition). Employer also\nargues that what occurred at the meeting did not rise to an abnormal working\ncondition, especially for police officers, whose employment is by nature highly\nstressful. In further support, Employer cites Rydzewski v. Workers\u2019 Compensation\nAppeal Board (City of Philadelphia), 767 A.2d 13 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001), and Young\nv. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (New Sewickley Police Department), 737\nA.2d 317 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).              In Rydzewski, our Court held that a City of\nPhiladelphia police officer was not subjected to abnormal working conditions and\ncould not recover for a mental-mental injury when he witnessed two fellow officers\nget shot, one who later died and one who lived and was paralyzed. Our Court held\nthat \u201c[c]laimant did not prove he experienced a working condition that was\nparticularly abnormal for a person in his line of work.\u201d Rydzewski, 767 A.2d at 16.\n               In Young, our Court held that a police officer was not subjected to\nabnormal working conditions and could not recover for a mental-mental injury when\nhe served an arrest warrant in a domestic violence case, the subject threatened the\nclaimant and himself with a gun, but was later subdued and taken into custody. The\nCourt held that the claimant failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that the\n\u201cstand-off event was an abnormal working condition for a police officer, where\ncertain stressful and even life-threatening events and occurrences are expected\u201d due\nto the nature of the employment. Young, 737 A.2d at 322. Employer also relies on\nGriffin v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Luzerne County Children and\nYouth) (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1956 C.D. 2016, filed January 4, 2018),5 where this Court\nheld that a caseworker was properly denied benefits for a mental-mental injury when\n\n       5\n         See Pa.R.A.P. 126(b) (\u201cAs used in this rule, \u2018non-precedential decision\u2019 refers to . . . an\nunreported memorandum opinion of the Commonwealth Court filed after January 15, 2008.\n[]Non-precedential decisions . . . may be cited for their persuasive value.\u201d).\n                                                 7\n\fa child on her caseload was later killed while in her parent\u2019s custody. Relying on\nthe facts as found by the WCJ, this Court held that such an event was not an abnormal\nworking condition for a caseworker, and because the caseworker did not directly\nexperience a traumatic event at work, this case was distinguishable from Payes and\nKochanowicz. Griffin, slip op. at 6.\n             Claimant responds that Employer\u2019s reliance on Philadelphia\nNewspapers, Rydzewski, and Young is misplaced because all three cases were\ndecided before our Supreme Court decided Payes, which set forth a new analysis of\nmental-mental cases under the Act. Claimant argues that the WCJ did not err in his\nfindings or conclusion that Claimant suffered a compensable mental-mental injury,\nwhere the WCJ found that the two arrest incidents followed by the no-holds-barred\nmeeting were abnormal working conditions. Claimant argues that the WCJ properly\nfound that Employer\u2019s holding such a meeting, and how it conducted the meeting,\nwas an abnormal working condition even for an individual working as a police\nofficer.\n             We cannot conclude that the WCJ erred in finding \u201cthe scheduling of a\n\u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 meeting under these circumstances, is an extraordinary and\nunusual event and it constituted an abnormal working condition. This meeting was\n[the] last of a series of events that created a psychiatric/psychological injury to the\nClaimant.\u201d R.R. at 504a. The WCJ found Claimant credible when she testified that\nshe had never heard about a no-holds-barred meeting being held before, and that\nsuch meetings were not a part of police procedure. Id. at 325a. Officer Hall admitted\nthat no-holds-barred meetings did not occur regularly and that the meeting was\nunusual. Id. at 324a, 325a. In the memorandum prepared following the meeting,\nSergeant Lyda stated that other officers commented \u201cthis was the first time that\n\n\n                                          8\n\fsomething like this (room discussion) has ever taken place,\u201d thus admitting the\nmeeting was unusual. Id. at 31a. These facts, found by the WCJ and supported by\nthe record, support the WCJ\u2019s legal conclusion that under Payes,\n\n               [t]he actions and conduct of the officers of the City of\n               Harrisburg were extraordinary and unusual towards the\n               Claimant and created an abnormal work condition. The\n               holding of a \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d meeting is an extraordinary\n               and unusual event for any organization that has a chain of\n               command. The holding of such a meeting is an abnormal\n               working condition.\nId. at 505a.\n               Here, the WCJ found that an abnormal working condition existed when\ntwo arrests occurred where Claimant was criticized by other officers for not using\nher taser, followed by a no-holds-barred meeting that lasted about an hour, where\nClaimant was berated, and where her supervisors stated that the video of the incident\nshowed that she acted appropriately, but then allowed officers to continue berating\nher. The WCJ found Claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible that the prior failure-to-\ntase incidents, culminating in the no-holds-barred meeting, caused her to fear that\nshe would not be backed up by other officers. R.R. at 264a. Claimant\u2019s reaction\nwas not merely based on her perceptions, but on statements made by her fellow\nofficers, which included that \u201cshe was a fucking liability,\u201d and that \u201c85% of the\nplatoon didn\u2019t want to work with her.\u201d Id. at 347a. We recognize that the finding\nof an abnormal working condition is \u201chighly fact sensitive\u201d and \u201cmust be considered\nin the context of specific employment.\u201d Payes, 79 A.3d at 552. Even so, we\nconclude that the WCJ did not err when he found that the events described here were\nan abnormal working condition, even for a police officer whose employment\nrequires her to work in a very stressful environment.\n\n\n                                           9\n\f             Employer further argues that the WCJ erred by awarding Claimant\nbenefits from February 3, 2016, the date when Employer notified Claimant that she\nwas unfit for duty. Rather, Employer argues that if benefits are awarded, they should\nbegin on March 21, 2017, the date when Dr. Christian Kcomt (Claimant\u2019s expert)\nbegan treating Claimant. Employer argues that Claimant failed to present competent\nmedical evidence that as of February 3, 2016, she has a psychological condition and\nthat the condition was caused by her employment. Employer correctly argues that\nClaimant has the burden to prove that she has a psychological condition that was\ncaused by her employment. Lowe v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\n(Lowes Auto Sales, Inc.), 619 A.2d 411, 414 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1992). However, we\ncannot agree that the WCJ and the Board erred by awarding Claimant benefits from\nFebruary 3, 2016.\n             Claimant\u2019s expert, a board-certified psychiatrist, began treating\nClaimant on March 21, 2017, when he took over Claimant\u2019s treatment after her prior\ntreating physician, Dr. John Mira, retired due to health issues. R.R. at 432a.\nClaimant\u2019s expert testified by deposition that Claimant suffered from major\ndepressive disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and an eating disorder in remission,\nand that she was unable to perform the job duties of a police officer due to the\npotential for mental health decompensation. Id. at 181a-82a. Claimant\u2019s expert\nbegan treating Claimant on March 21, 2017, and he admitted that he was unable to\nrender an opinion as to her diagnosis or her ability to return to work before he met\nher. Id. at 188a. However, Claimant\u2019s expert further testified that he reviewed her\nmedical records, including those from her prior treating physician, after which he\nopined, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Claimant\u2019s\npsychological conditions were \u201cdue to direct issues because of what she experienced\n\n\n                                         10\n\fas a police officer,\u201d which the WCJ found to be credible. Id. at 186a, 504a. Based\non this evidence, we agree with the Board that \u201csubstantial, competent evidence\nsupports [that] Claimant\u2019s work-related medical condition disabled her from\nworking as a police officer for [Employer] as of February 3, 2016.\u201d Id. at 543a.\n             Employer next argues that the WCJ erred in determining its fact\nwitnesses were not credible, specifically, Officer Hall, Sergeant Lyda, and Captain\nMoody, because those credibility determinations are not supported by substantial\nevidence. R.R. at 502a. Employer then attempts to point out specific pieces of\ntestimony from these fact witnesses which, it argues, demonstrate that the WCJ\u2019s\ncredibility determinations lack substantial evidence. This argument is misplaced. In\nworkers\u2019 compensation cases, \u201cthe WCJ is the ultimate fact-finder who must\ndetermine credibility and evidentiary weight. In this role, the WCJ freely evaluates\nthe evidence offered and can accept or reject any witness\u2019 testimony, in whole or in\npart, including that of medical witnesses.\u201d Davis v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal\nBoard (City of Philadelphia), 753 A.2d 905, 909 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2000). As this Court\nfurther stated, \u201c[w]hile this Court can and should consider the competency and\nsufficiency of evidence presented before a WCJ, the WCJ\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility is not subject to our review on appeal.\u201d Id. Therefore, we find that the\nWCJ did not err when, on remand, he made specific credibility determinations as to\nEmployer\u2019s fact witnesses, based on inconsistencies within their testimony,\nparticularly since it was specifically directed to do so by the Board.\n             Finally, Employer argues that the WCJ erred by considering hearsay\nmedical reports relied on by its expert, Dr. D. Gladys Fenichel (Employer\u2019s expert).\nEmployer argues that the WCJ erred in considering reports from Claimant\u2019s prior\ntreating physician, from Employer\u2019s physician Dr. Louis Laguna, and from the\n\n\n                                          11\n\fRenfrew Center, where Claimant received in-patient treatment, when those\nindividuals did not testify and were not subject to cross-examination, and when\nEmployer objected to those reports as hearsay. Employer is correct in asserting that\nhearsay evidence, properly objected to, is not competent evidence to support a\nfinding of fact. Flanagan v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (U.S. Steel\nCorporation), 598 A.2d 613, 615 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1991). Here, however, the WCJ did\nnot rely on these hearsay expert reports to make findings about their opinions, but to\nmake a credibility determination as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s expert.\n             Employer\u2019s expert testified that Claimant\u2019s disability was not causally\nrelated to her employment, based on one meeting with Claimant, and based on\nmedical reports from Claimant\u2019s past treatment providers, which were attached as\nexhibits to her deposition testimony, and on the report of Claimant\u2019s expert. R.R. at\n33a-126a. The WCJ found the testimony of Claimant\u2019s expert to be credible, but\ngave less weight to Employer\u2019s expert \u201cbecause she has evaluated the Claimant one\ntime.   The testimony of [Claimant\u2019s expert] is not credible because she was\ncontradicted by multiple medical providers, whose reports and records she had\nreviewed and commented on.\u201d Id. at 504a. The WCJ also found that the procedure\nof asking Employer\u2019s expert \u201cto comment on other doctor\u2019s medical reports and\nrecords waives any objection that [Employer] may have to discussion of those in the\ndeposition or consideration of those exhibits by this Court.\u201d Id. at 503a.\n             As this Court stated,\n\n             it has long been held that a medical witness may express\n             an opinion based upon medical records of others even if\n             those records were not introduced into evidence so long as\n             they are the kind of records upon which the medical\n             professional customarily relies in the practice of their\n             profession.\n\n                                         12\n\fMithani v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Mt. Airy Lodge), 730 A.2d 566,\n569 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).       Here, we cannot conclude that the WCJ erred in\nconsidering the medical reports reviewed by Employer\u2019s expert, which were\nattached as exhibits to her deposition testimony, to make a credibility determination,\nwhen it is customary for a medical expert to review such reports, and when Employer\nasked its expert to comment on these reports.\n             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Board\u2019s order.\n\n\n\n\n                                       MICHAEL H.

KEVIN BROBSON, President Judge\n            HONORABLE MICHAEL H. WOJCIK, Judge\n            HONORABLE CHRISTINE FIZZANO CANNON, Judge\n\nOPINION NOT REPORTED\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBY JUDGE WOJCIK                                    FILED: December 3, 2021\n\n\n            The City of Harrisburg (Employer) petitions for review of an order of\nthe Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirming an order of a Workers\u2019\nCompensation Judge (WCJ), which granted Allison Shuff (Claimant) total disability\nbenefits for a psychological injury in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), depression, and anxiety, that resulted from an abnormal working condition.\nEmployer contends that the WCJ and the Board erred by finding that Claimant met\nthe required burden of proof that she sustained a compensable psychological injury\nas a result of an abnormal working condition. In the alternative, Employer argues\nthat the WCJ and the Board erred by awarding Claimant benefits from February 3,\n\f2016, when Claimant failed to present competent medical evidence of a disability\nuntil March 21, 2017.        Employer also argues that the WCJ\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s fact witnesses were not supported\nby substantial evidence. Employer further argues that the WCJ and the Board erred\nby considering medical opinions of doctors who did not testify but which were relied\nupon by Employer\u2019s medical expert. Upon review, we affirm.\n             The relevant facts as found by the WCJ are as follows. Claimant began\nworking for Employer as a police officer in January 2010. On January 6, 2016,\nClaimant filed a claim petition alleging that she suffered an injury in the nature of\ndepression and PTSD based on two incidents that occurred in the course and scope\nof her employment. Both incidents involved Claimant\u2019s failure to use a taser on\nalleged perpetrators. Following the second incident, a meeting was held with\nClaimant, other officers in Claimant\u2019s platoon, and Claimant\u2019s supervisors. At the\nmeeting, which was described as a \u201cno-holds-barred meeting,\u201d other officers yelled\nat, swore, and berated Claimant. At this meeting, Officer Marc Hall told Claimant\nthat officers who go outside their platoon, \u201cdon\u2019t stick around for long.\u201d Officers\nHall, Chad McGowan, and Ryan Fetzer yelled at Claimant, called her a liar, and told\nher that she was \u201ctrying to get them fired.\u201d Officer McGowan told Claimant that\nshe was a \u201cfucking liability\u201d and that \u201c85% of her shift doesn\u2019t want to work with\nher.\u201d Officer McGowan told Claimant that he felt \u201cshe kicked him in the balls\u201d by\nher not tasing the suspect. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 501a.\n             After allowing the officers to yell, berate, and curse at Claimant,\nCorporal Galkowski brought the officers to a computer and showed them the video\nof the arrest that occurred during the second incident, and he agreed with Claimant\nthat she acted appropriately in not tasing the suspect. Despite Corporal Galkowski\u2019s\n\n\n                                         2\n\fstatement, the officers continued to yell at and berate Claimant. R.R. at 502a.\nClaimant was placed on administrative duty on August 25, 2015, and attended a\nfitness for duty evaluation, where she was evaluated by Employer\u2019s physician, Dr.\nLouis Laguna, who indicated Claimant was not fit for duty as a police officer.\nFollowing the evaluation, Chief Thomas Carter informed Claimant there were no\nwork activities available for her, Claimant ceased work as of February 3, 2016, and\nhas not returned to work since that date. Id. at 502a-03a.\n               Following hearings on Claimant\u2019s claim petition, the WCJ issued a\ndecision dated February 2, 2018, finding that Claimant suffered a work-related\nmental injury in the form of PTSD, depression, and anxiety as a result of the two\nfailure to tase incidents, which culminated in the no-holds-barred meeting. R.R. at\n454a-63a. Specifically, the WCJ determined that the no-holds-barred meeting where\nClaimant was yelled at by her coworkers constituted an abnormal working condition\nunder the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.1 Id. at 460a-61a. The WCJ ordered\nEmployer to pay Claimant temporary total disability benefits and ongoing medical\ncosts from February 3, 2016, the date on which Claimant received the letter from\nChief Carter indicating she was not fit for duty. Id. at 463a. On June 25, 2019, the\nBoard issued an opinion and order remanding the case to the WCJ to make additional\ncredibility determinations, in particular, as to the testimony of Employer\u2019s fact\nwitnesses, Officer Hall, Sergeant Raymond Lyda, and Captain Deric Moody. Id. at\n486a-95a. By decision dated December 12, 2019, the WCJ made specific credibility\nfindings as to Employer\u2019s fact witnesses, again granted Claimant\u2019s claim petition,\nand ordered Employer to continue payment of Claimant\u2019s ongoing total disability\nbenefits and medical costs as of February 3, 2016. Id. at 499a-508a.\n\n\n      1\n          Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-1041.4, 2501-2710.\n                                               3\n\f            In that decision, the WCJ made the following findings relevant to the\nexistence of an abnormal working condition.\n\n            12. The testimony of Officer Marc Hall concerning his\n            actions, words and conduct at the no-holds-barred meeting\n            is not credible. His testimony that tempers were up and\n            voices were raised contradicts his later testimony that no\n            one was yelling. Officer Hall admitted [that] he yelled at\n            Claimant. Also, he still insisted that Claimant should have\n            \u201cfucking tased the suspect.\u201d He admitted [that] everyone\n            was cursing. He admitted that the \u201cno hold[s] bar[r]ed\u201d\n            meeting did not occur regularly. He admitted [that] the\n            meeting was unusual.\n\n            13. The testimony of Sargent [sic] Raymond Lyda is not\n            credible concerning his testimony that there was no yelling\n            and screaming at the meeting. Further, Sargent [sic]\n            Lyda\u2019s testimony is not credible because [it] is\n            extraordinary and unusual for a supervisor to allow yelling\n            and berating of an officer by fellow officers after she was\n            exonerated by the video of the tasing incident. Sergeant\n            Lyda admitted to the meeting as a \u201cno-hold[s]-barred\u201d\n            meeting and acknowledges that officer McGowan told\n            Claimant [that] she was a \u201cfucking liability and [that] 85%\n            of the police force didn\u2019t want to work with her.\u201d\n\n            14. The testimony of Captain Deric Moody is not credible\n            as to whether a no-holds-barred meeting was acceptable\n            conduct for a police department concerning a meeting\n            [that] he did not even know about at the time [that] it was\n            held. Captain Moody testified [that] he found out about\n            the \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d meeting after it occurred.\n\n                                      ***\n\n            41. This Judge finds [that] the scheduling of a \u201cno-holds-\n            barred\u201d meeting under these circumstances, is an\n            extraordinary and unusual event and [that] it constituted\n            an abnormal working condition. This meeting was [the]\n            last of a series of events that created\n            psychiatric/psychological injury to the Claimant.\n\n                                        4\n\f                42. The testimony of the Claimant is found to be credible\n                and the Claimant has been unable to work since February\n                4, 2016.\n\nR.R. at 502a, 504a.\n                Employer appealed the WCJ\u2019s second decision to the Board, on the\nbasis that the WCJ erred by finding that Claimant sustained a compensable work\ninjury under the Act. On October 15, 2020, the Board affirmed the WCJ\u2019s second\ndecision. Employer then petitioned this Court for review.2\n                In addition to the Court\u2019s usual review in a workers\u2019 compensation\nmatter,3 when the case involves a mental-mental injury,4 we must also consider\nwhether Claimant sustained her burden to prove that the mental injury she suffered\nis something other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions, i.e., that\n\n       2\n         Employer requested supersedeas from the Board, which was denied. R.R. at 562a-73a.\nEmployer then sought supersedeas from this Court, which was denied in a Memorandum and Order\ndated January 20, 2021.\n\n       3\n         Our scope of review in a workers\u2019 compensation appeal is limited to determining whether\nan error of law was committed, whether constitutional rights were violated, or whether necessary\nfindings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.

Claimant argues that the WCJ did not err in his\nfindings or conclusion that Claimant suffered a compensable mental-mental injury,\nwhere the WCJ found that the two arrest incidents followed by the no-holds-barred\nmeeting were abnormal working conditions. Claimant argues that the WCJ properly\nfound that Employer\u2019s holding such a meeting, and how it conducted the meeting,\nwas an abnormal working condition even for an individual working as a police\nofficer.\n             We cannot conclude that the WCJ erred in finding \u201cthe scheduling of a\n\u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 meeting under these circumstances, is an extraordinary and\nunusual event and it constituted an abnormal working condition. This meeting was\n[the] last of a series of events that created a psychiatric/psychological injury to the\nClaimant.\u201d R.R. at 504a.

As this Court\nfurther stated, \u201c[w]hile this Court can and should consider the competency and\nsufficiency of evidence presented before a WCJ, the WCJ\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility is not subject to our review on appeal.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1891664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1891664/davis-v-wcab-city-of-philadelphia/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Therefore, we find that the\nWCJ did not err when, on remand, he made specific credibility determinations as to\nEmployer\u2019s fact witnesses, based on inconsistencies within their testimony,\nparticularly since it was specifically directed to do so by the Board.\n             Finally, Employer argues that the WCJ erred by considering hearsay\nmedical reports relied on by its expert, Dr. D.

R.R. at\n33a-126a. The WCJ found the testimony of Claimant\u2019s expert to be credible, but\ngave less weight to Employer\u2019s expert \u201cbecause she has evaluated the Claimant one\ntime.

Hutter of Powers &amp; Santola, LLP, Albany, of counsel), for respondent.</p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pritzker, J.</p>\r\n<p>Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (J. Walsh, J.), entered May 15, 2020 in Saratoga County, which, upon remittal, denied defendants' motion for a final judgment.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, defendant Michael Bonesteel (hereinafter defendant) moved into an apartment complex operated by plaintiff. At the time, defendant had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In 2013, defendant requested an accommodation to plaintiff's policy prohibiting pets to allow defendant to acquire an emotional support dog. Defendant supported his request with a letter from his treating psychologist. Plaintiff denied defendant's request.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, defendant submitted a complaint to defendant Attorney General, who began an investigation pursuant to Executive Law \u00a7 63 to determine whether the denial was discriminatory.<sup><b>[FN1]</b></sup> Shortly thereafter, plaintiff commenced this action, seeking, among other things, a declaration that plaintiff's refusal to permit defendant to have an emotional support dog had not violated the Fair Housing Act (<i>see</i> 42 USC \u00a7 3601 <i>et seq.</i> [hereinafter FHA]) and the Human Rights Law (<i>see</i> Executive Law art 15 [hereinafter HRL]). Thereafter, plaintiff notified defendant that it was reducing his lease renewal term from one year to three months. Defendant answered and brought several counterclaims, including that plaintiff had discriminated against him by denying his request for an accommodation and retaliated against him by shortening his lease term, both in violation of the FHA and the HRL.</p>\r\n<p>Following a nonjury trial, Supreme Court (Chauvin, J.) determined, as relevant here, that, although the request \"clearly appear[ed] to be reasonable in nature,\" defendant did not prove that having an emotional support dog was a necessary accommodation and he had further failed to prove retaliation. Accordingly, the court issued a judgment that declared that plaintiff did not violate the FHA and the HRL and dismissed the counterclaims.</p>\r\n<p>On appeal, this Court first dismissed plaintiff's declaratory judgment action, sua sponte, finding it to be \"premature and nonjusticiable\" given the lack of any concrete harm resulting from defendant merely asking for an exception to the pet policy (173 AD3d 55, 60 [2019]). This Court then considered defendant's discrimination counterclaims, specifically addressing \"two narrow and carefully circumscribed issues: (1) whether defendant has a qualifying disability within the meaning of the FHA and the HRL and (2) whether the accommodation he requested was 'necessary to afford [him] equal opportunity to use and enjoy [his] dwelling' as provided in the [FHA and the HRL]\" (<i>id.</i> at 61, quoting 42 USC \u00a7 3604 [f] [3] [B]; <i>see</i> Executive Law \u00a7 296 [18] [2]). Conducting an independent assessment of the evidence, this Court determined that \"defendant established that he is disabled and that an emotional support dog is 'necessary to afford [him] equal opportunity to use and enjoy [his] dwelling' within the [*2]meaning of the FHA and the HRL\" (173 AD3d at 68, quoting 42 USC \u00a7 3604 [f] [3] [B]). Given the limited scope of review, this Court expressly did not make any determination on the remaining factors necessary to establish a violation of the FHA or the HRL \u2014 whether plaintiff knew about defendant's disability, whether plaintiff denied defendant's request and whether the requested accommodation was reasonable \u2014 and remitted the matter to Supreme Court to make a final determination on defendant's discrimination counterclaims (173 AD3d at 68). This Court also determined that defendant was entitled to judgment in his favor on his retaliation counterclaims and remitted the matter to Supreme Court for a determination of an appropriate remedy with respect thereto (<i>id.</i> at 70).</p>\r\n<p>Upon remittal, a motion for a final judgment as to defendant's discrimination counterclaims was made. Supreme Court (J. Walsh, J.), concluding that the reasonableness determination of Supreme Court (Chauvin, J.) was not law of the case, found that it could not determine whether defendant's request was reasonable when \"merely limited to reading the trial transcript,\" adding that there were \"factual issues\" concerning whether the type of dog that defendant wanted \"would pose a safety risk to the other tenants.\" The court determined that it needed to hold a hearing to resolve these issues and to determine damages, and consequently denied the motion. Defendant appeals.</p>\r\n<p>Defendant argues that Supreme Court (J. Walsh, J.) erred in failing to make a determination on the reasonableness of his requested accommodation because Supreme Court (Chauvin, J.) had previously made such a determination, rendering it the law of the case. Defendant additionally argues that Supreme Court (J. Walsh, J.) failed to follow the instructions of this Court by deciding to hold a hearing on reasonableness and damages rather than determining these issues on the trial record. We disagree with both arguments. First, for several reasons, we do not find that the comment by Supreme Court (Chauvin, J.) is law of the case. First, it is not a holding, but rather \"merely dicta\" (<i>Karol v Polsinello</i>, 127 AD3d 1401, 1402-1403 [2015]; <i>see Matter of McNamee, Lochner, Titus &amp; Williams [Killeen]</i>, 267 AD2d 919, 922 [1999]). Because the court dismissed the claims on other grounds, it was not required to and did not in fact reach the issue of reasonableness on the merits (<i>see generally Reutzel v Hunter Yes, Inc.</i>, 166 AD3d 1111, 1112 [2018]; <i>Rosen v Mosby</i>, 148 AD3d 1228, 1233 [2017], <i>lv dismissed</i> 30 NY3d 1037 [2017]). Notably, this Court previously remitted this <i>very issue</i> to Supreme Court to determine, implicitly finding that the issue had not been reached (173 AD3d at 68). \"[A] trial court, upon a remand or remittitur, is without power to do anything except to obey the mandate of the higher court, and render judgment in conformity therewith\" (<i>People v Weber</i>, 195 AD3d 1544, 1544 [2021] [internal quotation marks and citation [*3]omitted], <i>lv granted</i> ___ NY3d ___ [Nov. 18, 2021]; <i>see Reilly v Achitoff</i>, 160 AD3d 998, 999 [2018]; <i>see generally</i> Siegel &amp; Connors, NY Prac \u00a7 545 at 1051-1052 [6th ed 2018]). Thus, Supreme Court (J. Walsh, J.) was required to follow the instructions of this Court by deciding the matter and was not bound by the prior comment regarding reasonableness (<i>see J.N.K. Mach. Corp. v TBW, Ltd.</i>, 98 AD3d 1259, 1260 [2012]; <i>Ramsay v Mary Imogene Bassett Hosp.</i>, 158 AD2d 754, 755 [1990], <i>lv denied</i> 76 NY2d 702 [1990]). Moreover, we find that the court properly exercised its discretion in scheduling a hearing to determine the issue of reasonableness as it concluded that the record of the first trial was insufficient to determine the issue. The general remittal from this Court did not instruct Supreme Court to limit this determination solely to the existing record, and we find that its decision that additional testimony was needed to intelligently proceed was a valid exercise of judicial discretion (<i>see generally</i> CPLR 4404). Likewise, we discern no error in Supreme Court determining that a hearing is necessary to determine damages on the retaliation claim.</p>\r\n<p>Garry, P.J., Egan Jr., Aarons and Colangelo, JJ., concur.</p>\r\n<p>ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Footnotes</b></div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Footnote 1:</b> A motion by the Attorney General to intervene in this action was granted.\r\n<br><br><br><br><div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>",

Valenzuela, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: December 1, 2021\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n           This appeal arises from the trial court\u2019s granting of Guiding Light, LLC\u2019s Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code section 74.351 motion to dismiss the survival and wrongful death\n\nlawsuit filed against it by Enrique Lopez, Individually and as Representative of the Estate of\n\nTristen Lopez, Deceased (\u201cLopez\u201d). We affirm.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n           In August 2018, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (the\n\n\u201cDepartment\u201d) was granted temporary managing conservatorship of Lopez\u2019s fourteen-year-old\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nson, T.L. In that same month, T.L. was admitted to Renaissance Behavioral Center (\u201cRBC\u201d)\n\nbecause he made threats of suicide. RBC later recommended T.L. \u201cattend a residential treatment\n\ncenter to achieve maximum stability before attempting to place him with a foster family.\u201d On\n\nSeptember 4, 2018, T.L. was transferred to Guiding Light, which is a residential child-care facility\n\noperated pursuant to a contract with the Department. On the evening of September 16, T.L. and\n\nanother resident got into a physical altercation and a staff member called the Bexar County\n\nSheriff\u2019s Office. The events of the evening are disputed; however, the Sheriff\u2019s incident report\n\nindicates that when the deputies arrived, staff members were performing CPR on T.L. He was\n\ntransported to a hospital by EMS and died fifteen days later.\n\n        Lopez sued Guiding Light alleging wrongful death and survival claims. Lopez contended\n\nit was unclear whether T.L. died at the hands of the other resident or one of the staff members\n\nattempting to end the fight. He alleged Guiding Light was negligent because it failed to (1)\n\nproperly and adequately train and supervise its employees; (2) oversee and supervise the young\n\nmen entrusted to Guiding Light; and (3) exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of\n\ninjury to others.\n\n        Guiding Light answered and filed its motion to dismiss, alleging Lopez\u2019s suit should be\n\ndismissed with prejudice because he failed to serve an expert report within the 120-day deadline\n\nset forth in section 74.351(a). Lopez responded that he was not required to file an expert report\n\nbecause Guiding Light was not a health care provider and his claim was not a health-care liability\n\nclaim. The trial court conducted a hearing, and later signed an order granting Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice and awarding Guiding Light attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal ensued.\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Generally, we review a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying a motion to dismiss under\n\nsection 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code for an abuse of discretion.

The purpose of the expert report requirement is to weed out frivolous\n\nmalpractice claims in the early stages of litigation, not to dispose of potentially meritorious claims.\n\nPalacios, 46 S.W.3d at 877; see also Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 258 (\u201c[Expert report] requirements\n\nare meant to identify frivolous claims and reduce the expense and time to dispose of any that are\n\nfiled.\u201d). In accordance with that purpose, the Act provides a mechanism for dismissal of the\n\nclaimant\u2019s suit in the event of an untimely or deficient report. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.351(b); see also Abshire v. Christus Health Se. Tex., 563 S.W.3d 219, 223 (Tex. 2018). \u201cIf,\n\nas to a defendant physician or health care provider, an expert report has not been served within the\n\nperiod specified by Subsection (a), the court, on the motion of the affected physician or health care\n\nprovider, shall, subject to Subsection (c), enter an order that:\n\n       (1) awards to the affected physician or health care provider reasonable attorney\u2019s\n       fees and costs of court incurred by the physician or health care provider; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       (2) dismisses the claim with respect to the physician or health care provider, with\n       prejudice to the refiling of the claim.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.351(b).\n\n       \u201cThe broad language of the [Act] evidences legislative intent for the statute to have\n\nexpansive application.\u201d Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 256. \u201cThe breadth of the statute\u2019s text essentially\n\ncreates a presumption that a claim is [a healthcare liability claim] if it is against a physician or\n\nhealth care provider and is based on facts implicating the defendant\u2019s conduct during the course\n\nof a patient\u2019s care, treatment, or confinement.\u201d Id. \u201cBut the presumption is necessarily rebuttable.\u201d\n\nId. \u201cIn some instances the only possible relationship between the conduct underlying a claim and\n\nthe rendition of medical services or healthcare will be the healthcare setting (i.e., the physical\n\nlocation of the conduct in a health care facility), the defendant\u2019s status as a doctor or health care\n\nprovider, or both.\u201d Id.\n\n       A healthcare liability claim contains three basic elements: (1) a physician or health care\n\nprovider must be a defendant; (2) the claim or claims at issue must concern treatment, lack of\n\ntreatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical care, or health care, or safety or\n\nprofessional or administrative services directly related to health care; and (3) the defendant\u2019s act\n\nor omission complained of must proximately cause the injury to the claimant. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(a)(13).\n\n       In this case, Lopez did not file an expert report, and the trial court dismissed his suit with\n\nprejudice. On appeal, Lopez contends he was not required to file an expert report because Guiding\n\nLight failed to establish the Act applies to his claims. Lopez argues (1) Guiding Light is not a\n\nhealth care provider and (2) he is not asserting a health care liability claim. Guiding Light had the\n\nburden of establishing that it is a health care provider. Akhter v. Smooth Sols.

CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(a)(13) (defining \u201chealth care liability claim\u201d).\n\nGuiding Light must be a health care provider for the rebuttable presumption to apply. See Bioderm\n\nSkin Care, LLC v. Sok, 426 S.W.3d 753, 758 (Tex. 2014). The Act defines \u201chealth care\u201d to mean\n\n\u201cany act or treatment performed or furnished, or that should have been performed or furnished, by\n\nany health care provider for, to, or on behalf of a patient during the patient\u2019s medical care,\n\ntreatment, or confinement.\u201d TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(10). A \u201chealth care provider\u201d\n\nmeans \u201cany person, partnership, professional association, corporation, facility, or institution duly\n\nlicensed, certified, registered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care . . ..\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A).

Is Guiding Light a Health Care Provider? 2\n\n         As described above, the Act defines \u201chealth care provider\u201d as a \u201ccorporation . . . duly\n\nlicensed, certified, registered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care,\u201d including\n\ncertain persons and entities expressly listed. Id. \u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A). \u201cIt is clear from the language\n\nof section 74.001(a)(12)(A) that the general requirement of being \u2018duly licensed, certified,\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Guiding Light also contends its \u201cLicensed Professional Counselor\u201d (\u201cLPC\u201d), Treatment Director Manuel Lozano Jr.,\nMS, is a health care provider. However, Lopez did not file suit against Lozano; therefore, his alleged status as a\nhealthcare provider is not relevant to whether Guiding Light is a healthcare provider.\n2\n  For the first time on appeal, Lopez raises several objections to certain exhibits attached to Guiding Light\u2019s motion\nto dismiss. Because none of the objections were brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, they are waived.\n\n\n                                                        -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nregistered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care\u2019 is primary to any consideration\n\nrespecting similarity to the persons and entities expressly listed thereafter.\u201d Lutheran Soc.

Therefore, we begin our analysis by considering whether Guiding\n\nLight demonstrated it meets the general requirement of being \u201cduly licensed, certified, registered,\n\nor chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care.\u201d See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A).\n\n       On appeal, Lopez urges this court to apply the reasoning in Shiloh Treatment Center, Inc.\n\nv. Ward, 510 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.), to reverse the trial court\u2019s\n\ndismissal of his claim against Guiding Light. In that case, Shiloh Treatment\u2019s license specifically\n\nlisted: \u201cType[s] of Treatment Services[:] Emotional Disorders[,] Mental Retardation[, and]\n\nPervasive Developmental Disorders.\u201d Shiloh Treatment argued that because its child-care license\n\nincluded \u201ctreatment services,\u201d it was \u201clicensed . . . to provide health care\u201d pursuant to the Act. Id.\n\nat 39. Shiloh Treatment also relied on the regulatory definition of \u201cresidential treatment center\u201d\n\nas \u201c[a] general residential operation for 13 or more children or young adults that exclusively\n\nprovides treatment services for children with emotional disorders.\u201d Id. at *4 (citing 40 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE \u00a7 748.43(40)).\n\n       The court of appeals disagreed and concluded Shiloh Treatment was \u201cnot licensed to be\n\nanything other than a residential treatment center\u201d and Shiloh Treatment had provided no evidence\n\nof what treatment services it provided. Id. In rejecting Shiloh Treatment\u2019s arguments, the court\n\nof appeals stated in part, \u201c[a]lthough Shiloh Treatment was authorized to provide treatment\n\nservices for emotional disorders, this alone cannot be enough to make it a health care provider.\u201d\n\nId. at 40. The court observed (1) the regulatory definition cited by Shiloh Treatment \u201csays nothing\n\nabout the kind or degree of treatment services rendered\u201d and (2) although mental care facilities\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nlicensed under certain provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code are specifically identified\n\nin the Act as \u201chealth care providers,\u201d Shiloh Treatment was not licensed under those provisions,\n\nbut rather was licensed pursuant to the Human Resources Code. Id. The court also reasoned that\n\nwhile \u201c[a] pedicurist may be said to \u2018treat\u2019 a callous; a yoga instructor may be said to \u2018treat\u2019\n\nanxiety; [and] a teacher may be said to \u2018treat\u2019 a learning difference,\u201d \u201cnone are automatically health\n\ncare providers rendering medical treatment to patients.\u201d Id. (citing Skloss v. Perez, No. 01\u201308\u2013\n\n00484\u2013CV, 2009 WL 40438, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Jan. 8, 2009, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (licensed professional counselor was health care provider because she was licensed to provide\n\nmedical treatment to patients)). Additionally, the court stated in part,\n\n           . . . According to [the Department], treatment services are \u201ca specialized type\n       of child-care services designed to treat and/or support children.\u201d . . . \u201cChild-care\n       services [means] services that meet a child\u2019s basic need for shelter, nutrition,\n       clothing, nurture, socialization, and interpersonal skills, care for personal health and\n       hygiene, supervision, education, and service planning.\u201d . . . This suggests that\n       these services are general in nature and not medical services.\n\n                                               ...\n\n           In addition, the record contains no evidence that Shiloh Treatment actually\n       provided any medical care or treatment to Ward or any other person. There is no\n       indication of how many members of Shiloh\u2019s staff, if any, were medical personnel.\n       There is no evidence regarding the extent that medical personnel controlled or\n       influenced any child-care services rendered to Ward. There is no medical\n       documentation from Shiloh Treatment in the record. . ..\n\n                                               ...\n\n          Given the sparse record evidence, we cannot conclude that Shiloh Treatment\n       was \u201cduly licensed, certified, registered, or chartered by the State of Texas to\n       provide health care.\u201d\n\nId. at 39-40 (citations omitted).\n\n       As in Shiloh, Guiding Light asserted that it is licensed by the Texas Health and Human\n\nServices Commission and \u201chas been issued a license to operate as a General Residential Operation\n\n\u2013 Residential Treatment Center Under the Provisions of Chapter 42, Human Resources Code.\u201d\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       As a \u201cGeneral Residential Operation\u2014Residential Treatment Center\u201d and, as part of its\n\nlicensing and pursuant to Texas Human Resources Code section 40.058, it entered into a\n\nResidential Child-Care Contract with the Department. Whether Guiding Light is a health care\n\nprovider requires this court to examine the type of operation Guiding Light was licensed to operate\n\nand determine the type of services it was licensed to provide. The answers to these questions are\n\nfound in the Texas Human Resources Code and the Texas Administrative Code.\n\n       1. Type of operation\n\n       The Department\u2019s Child-Care Licensing Division licensed Guiding Light as a residential\n\ntreatment center, which is a type of \u201cgeneral residential operation.\u201d Shiloh, 510 S.W.3d at 39.\n\n\u201c[R]esidential treatment centers\u201d (\u201cRTCs\u201d) are defined as \u201c[a] general residential operation for 13\n\nor more children or young adults that exclusively provides treatment services for children with\n\nemotional disorders.\u201d 26 TEX.

Therefore, the next question is whether Guiding Light provided evidence to the trial\n\ncourt that it actually provided such treatment to T.L. See Shiloh, 510 S.W.3d at 39 (\u201cIn addition,\n\nthe record contains no evidence that Shiloh Treatment actually provided any medical care or\n\ntreatment to Ward or any other person.\u201d).\n\nB.     Did Guiding Light Provide Mental Health Treatment?\n\n       The Department\u2019s \u201cApplication for Placement of Children in Residential Care\u201d indicated\n\nT.L. had \u201cmental health needs requiring treatment.\u201d The application recommended \u201cspecialized\u201d\n\nlevel of care because T.L. had suicidal ideations/self-harming behaviors, had been diagnosed with\n\nADHD, Tourette\u2019s Disorder, and major depression \u201cepisode without psychosis.\u201d He also was\n\nalleged to have a history of assaultive behavior, including choking his two-year-old female sibling\n\nand killing animals. The application listed the immediate goals of placement as providing T.L.\n\nwith a safe environment, the basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. Long term goals included\n\nproviding him \u201cwith extensive therapy to address the underlying issues that led to the removal and\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nto provide the child with life techniques so that he can have an opportunity to become a productive\n\ncitizen.\u201d\n\n        As outlined, Guiding Light\u2019s admission assessment of T.L. listed his level of care as\n\n\u201cspecialized,\u201d and noted the same history as contained in the Department\u2019s application. The\n\nassessment noted: \u201c[T.L.] has mental health needs requiring treatment. [T.L.] is diagnosed with\n\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder of the Combined Presentation and Major depressive\n\ndisorder, Recurrent episode, Severe without psychosis. [T.L.] has no substance abuse history.\u201d\n\nThe assessment stated T.L. would \u201cbe examined by a physician while in placement at Guiding\n\nLight to determine medical needs\u201d and as follows:\n\n        V. OBJECTIVE OF PLACEMENT The objectives of this placement are to protect\n        [T.L.] from abuse and neglect and to provide [T.L.] with care that meets his needs\n        for permanency and belonging.\n\n        BASIC NEEDS [T.L.] has basic needs and requires food, shelter, and clothing; He\n        will also receive routine medical and dental care, a safe stimulating and nurturing\n        home environment that will include friendships and recreational activities.\n\n        Short-term Goals of Placement: The short-term goals of this placement are for\n        [T.L.] to receive regular medical and dental care, and be provided with a safe\n        environment. [T.L.] will be emotionally stable and demonstrate good social skills.\n        [T.L.] will attend school regularly and participate in social and recreational\n        activities.\n\n        Long-term Goals of Placement: [T.L.\u2019s] long term goal for placement is\n        independent living skills and to maintain overall good physical, dental and medical\n        health. [T.L.] will demonstrate behavioral control and maintain positive\n        relationships. [T.L.] will learn to verbalize his feelings appropriately. Also, [T.L.]\n        will successfully complete school and will demonstrate good social skills.\n\n        The assessment stated T.L. would \u201creceive anger management techniques, problems\n\nsolving skills, and learn to interact positively with peers to de-escalate negative behaviors.\u201d\n\nGuiding Light\u2019s staff would \u201cpositively redirect [T.L.\u2019s] behavior by being consistent with the\n\nfacility\u2019s rules and consequences, as well as promoting fair practices[; and p]rovide commands\n\nthat are brief, calm, and non-confrontational.\u201d The assessment also stated Guiding Light\u2019s\n\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\ntherapist would \u201cmaintain regular individual and group therapy sessions to address [T.L.\u2019s]\n\nbehavior, problems solving skills, positive interactions with peers, impulse control, and provide\n\nanger management techniques.\u201d\n\n       Guiding Light also provided a \u201c72-Hour Treatment Plan,\u201d which stated: \u201c[T.L.] will need\n\ncoping skills/techniques to help to manage his anger and obtain positive social skills, increase\n\nimpulse control as well as problem solving and decision-making techniques.\u201d The plan described\n\nT.L.\u2019s \u201ctreatment services\u201d as follows:\n\n           [T.L.] will receive individual therapy to work on his aggression, impulsivity,\n       depression and suicidal ideation. He will also need to understand how his actions\n       produce both negative and positive consequences from the caregivers. [T.L.] needs\n       to be involved in a structured recreational experience with peers in order to practice\n       positive social skills and develop friends. His therapy would also address [T.L.\u2019s]\n       cognitive/academic needs and/or deficits.\n\n                                              ...\n\n          [T.L.] will receive weekly individual and group therapy. He will also receive\n       appropriate psychological evaluations and monthly medication monitoring.\n\n       The plan listed the same responsibilities for its staff and therapists as listed on the\n\nadmission assessment. The \u201ctransitional living\u201d section of the plan stated\n\n           As a resident of Guiding Light Residential Treatment Center, [T.L.] will\n       participates [sic] in individual therapy, group therapy, and staff daily groups that\n       will teach him problem solving, stress management, assessing consequences,\n       establishing goals and planning for the future. While at Guiding Light he will be\n       required to complete weekly chores such as washing dishes, sweeping, mopping,\n       taking the trash out, cleaning windows and/or assisting with setting the table, this\n       will teach him everyday life skills. Once [T.L.] turns 16 y/o, his caseworker will\n       submit a referral to PAL classes and a referral for Circle Of Support.\n\n       An \u201cIndividual Therapeutic Services Report,\u201d completed by Guiding Light\u2019s Treatment\n\nDirector, Manuel Lozano Jr., who is a licensed professional counselor, stated\n\n          This therapist [Lozano] inquired about what [T.L.] feels he needs to focus on\n       while in treatment. [T.L.] reported that he feels he needs to focus on \u201cDepression\n       and Anger.\u201d This therapist explained to [T.L.] that he and this therapist would\n       explore his behaviors, recommendations from [the Department], and put together a\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n        treatment plan. This therapist reviewed the expectations of the facility and how to\n        successfully adjust to the facility. This therapist also reviewed the rules of the\n        facility. [T.L.] indicated that he understood and added that if he can\u2019t stay here\n        until he is 18 years old he will probably go to a foster home. Rapport was\n        established.\n                                              ...\n\n            [T.L.] is seen in individual therapy on a weekly basis for 45 minute sessions.\n        The sessions take place in the RTC. He also participates in 45-minute group session\n        on a weekly basis.\n\n        Finally, Guiding Light attached to its motion to dismiss the affidavits of Lozano and its\n\nExecutive Director, Phyllis Bartell. Lozano attested he held three individual therapy sessions with\n\nT.L. in September 2018 and created T.L.\u2019s treatment plan based on T.L.\u2019s medical history and\n\nindividual interview sessions. Lozano also stated that, in addition to his services, the medical team\n\nconsists of a psychiatrist, who is available via Telemed and sees each resident once every sixty\n\ndays or as needed, to assist in treating the psychiatric wellbeing of the residents. Bartell attested\n\nthat \u201c[p]sychiatric treatment through our psychiatrist consultant & his/her colleagues is available\n\n24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d\n\n        We conclude Guiding Light established it is a health care provider based on (1) its license\n\nto provide \u201ctreatment services\u201d for \u201cemotional disorders,\u201d (2) the Department\u2019s application for\n\nplacement that listed as a long term goal providing T.L. \u201cwith extensive therapy to address the\n\nunderlying issues that led to the removal and to provide the child with life techniques so that he\n\ncan have an opportunity to become a productive citizen,\u201d (3) its contract with the Department to\n\nprovide these services, and (4) the evidence that it did, in fact, provide these services to T.L.\n\nTherefore, we next examine whether Lopez\u2019s claim is based on facts implicating Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nconduct during T.L.\u2019s care and treatment. If it is, then we apply the rebuttable presumption that\n\nthe claim is a health care liability claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f                                                                                        04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n                             HEALTH CARE LIABILITY CLAIM\n\n        One of the elements of a healthcare liability claim is that the claim or claims at issue must\n\nconcern treatment, lack of treatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical care, or\n\nhealth care, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health care. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(a)(13).\n\n        Generally, we review a trial court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to timely\n\nfile a section 74.351(a) expert report under an abuse of discretion standard; however, \u201c[t]he nature\n\nof the claims the Legislature intended to include under the [Act\u2019s] umbrella is a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction, a legal question we review de novo.\u201d Tex.

In determining whether Lopez\u2019s claim is a health care\n\nliability claim, we focus on the underlying nature of the cause of action and we are not bound by\n\nthe pleadings. Diversicare, 185 S.W.3d at 847. Artful pleading does not alter that nature. Yamada\n\nv. Friend, 335 S.W.3d 192, 196 (Tex. 2010). A claim based on one set of facts cannot be spliced\n\nor divided into both a healthcare liability claim and another type of claim. See id. at 197;\n\nDiversicare, 185 S.W.3d at 854. Thus, claims premised on facts that could support claims against\n\na physician or health care provider for departures from accepted standards of medical care, health\n\n\n                                                 - 17 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\ncare, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health care are\n\nhealthcare liability claims, regardless of whether the plaintiff alleges the defendant is liable for\n\nbreach of any of those standards. See Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 255.\n\n       \u201cIn defining the types of claims against health care providers constituting [health care\n\nliability claims], the question we face is not whether it seems that a claimed injury really arose\n\nfrom treatment commonly understood to be some type of medical or health care; nor do we address\n\nwhether the incident causing the injury would have been a common law negligence claim.\u201d Tex.\n\nW. Oaks Hosp., 371 S.W.3d at 179. \u201cInstead, the issue posed is whether the umbrella fashioned\n\nby the Legislature\u2019s promulgation of the [Act] includes the cause of action brought by a claimant\n\nagainst physicians or health care providers.\u201d Id. \u201c[W]e determine whether the relevant allegations\n\nare negligence claims or are properly characterized as [healthcare liability claims] under the Act.\u201d\n\nId. In making the determination, we consider the entire court record, including the pleadings,\n\nmotions and responses, and relevant evidence properly admitted. Id. at 258.\n\n       There are several types of healthcare liability claims set forth in the Act. In addition to\n\nclaims involving treatment and lack of treatment, the Act contemplates claims for alleged\n\n\u201cdeparture[s] from accepted standards of medical care, or health care, or safety or professional or\n\nadministrative services directly related to health care.\u201d       TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.001(a)(13) (emphasis added). All these categories of claims, except safety, are defined terms\n\nin the Act. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 74.001(a)(10), (a)(19), and (a)(24) (defining \u201chealth care,\u201d \u201cmedical\n\ncare,\u201d and \u201cprofessional or administrative services\u201d). Guiding Light asserts Lopez\u2019s claims allege\n\ndepartures from accepted standards of \u201csafety.\u201d Lopez argues his claim is for ordinary negligence\n\nand his claim relates to Guiding Light\u2019s failure to act as a reasonably prudent child-care center\n\nwould under the same or similar circumstances in its supervision of T.L.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                        04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n          The Act \u201cdoes not specifically state that a safety standards-based claim falls within its\n\nprovisions only if the claim has some relationship to the provision of health care other than the\n\nlocation of the occurrence, the status of the defendant, or both.\u201d Ross v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal\n\nHosp., 462 S.W.3d 496, 504 (Tex. 2015). \u201cBut the Legislature must have intended such a\n\nrelationship to be necessary, given the legislative intent explicitly set out in the [Act] and the\n\ncontext in which \u2018safety\u2019 is used in the statute.\u201d Id. The Ross Court concluded that, \u201c[c]onsidering\n\nthe purpose of the statute, the context of the language at issue, and the rule of ejusdem generis, . . .\n\nthe safety standards referred to in the definition are those that have a substantive relationship with\n\nthe providing of medical or health care.\u201d Id. \u201cAnd if it were not so, the broad meaning of \u2018safety\u2019\n\nwould afford defendant health care providers a special procedural advantage in the guise of\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to file expert reports in their suits regardless of whether their cause of action\n\nimplicated the provision of medical or health care.\u201d Id. The Court did not believe the Legislature\n\nintended the statute to have such arbitrary results. See id.\n\n          \u201cThe pivotal issue in a safety standards-based claim is whether the standards on which the\n\nclaim is based implicate the defendant\u2019s duties as a health care provider, including its duties to\n\nprovide for patient safety.\u201d Id. at 505. The line between a safety standards-based claim that is not\n\na healthcare liability claim and one that is \u201cmay not always be clear.\u201d Id. \u201cBut certain non-\n\nexclusive considerations lend themselves to analyzing whether such a claim is substantively\n\nrelated to the defendant\u2019s providing of medical or health care and is therefore a healthcare liability\n\nclaim\u201d:\n\n          1. Did the alleged negligence of the defendant occur in the course of the defendant\u2019s\n          performing tasks with the purpose of protecting patients from harm;\n          2. Did the injuries occur in a place where patients might be during the time they\n          were receiving care, so that the obligation of the provider to protect persons who\n          require special, medical care was implicated;\n          3. At the time of the injury was the claimant in the process of seeking or receiving\n          health care;\n\n\n                                                  - 19 -\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       4. At the time of the injury was the claimant providing or assisting in providing\n       health care;\n       5. Is the alleged negligence based on safety standards arising from professional\n       duties owed by the health care provider;\n       6. If an instrumentality was involved in the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, was it\n       a type used in providing health care; or\n       7. Did the alleged negligence occur in the course of the defendant\u2019s taking action\n       or failing to take action necessary to comply with safety-related requirements set\n       for health care providers by governmental or accrediting agencies?\n\nId.\n\n       \u201cWhen we examine these factors or considerations, we focus on the essence of the cause\n\nof action.\u201d Nexion Health Mgmt., Inc. v. Waddell, 05-20-00406-CV, 2020 WL 7767938, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Dec. 30, 2020, no pet.) (mem. op.). \u201cFor example, is the claim an ordinary\n\nnegligence claim or is the claim a health care liability claim as contemplated by the Legislature\n\nwhen it provided for health care liability claims in the [Act]?\u201d Id. Here, the pivotal issue is whether\n\nthe safety standards implicated Guiding Light\u2019s duties as a health care provider.\n\n       In his petition, Lopez brought a negligence claim against Guiding Light based on the\n\nfollowing factual allegations:\n\n           This case arises out of a catastrophic incident that occurred at a group home for\n       young men on or around September 16, 2018 in San Antonio, Texas. On that date,\n       [T.L.] was fatally injured while living at a group home owned and operated by the\n       Defendant and located at 17602 Tucker Place, San Antonio, Texas 78221.\n       Specifically, and based on information and belief, [T.L.] and other young men at\n       the home were not adequately supervised, began to fight, and during the fight or\n       soon after, [T.L.] passed away. It is unclear at this time whether [T.L.] died at the\n       hands of another young man living at the home or at the hands of one of the\n       employees attempting to break up the fight. Either way, Guiding Light failed to\n       provide [T.L.] and its employees with adequate supervision, adequate training, or a\n       safe home environment.\n\n       Lopez alleged Guiding Light breached its duty of care by failing to (1) properly and\n\nadequately train and supervise its employees; (2) properly oversee and supervise the young men\n\nentrusted to it; and (3) exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to others.\n\nBecause we have already determined Lopez\u2019s claim satisfies the first element of a health care\n\n\n                                                 - 20 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nliability claim because Guiding Light is a health care provider, and Guiding Light did not dispute\n\nthat the third element of a health care liability claim (causation of the injury) was not satisfied,\n\nLopez may only rebut the presumption that his claim is a health care liability claim by proving his\n\nclaim does not constitute an alleged \u201cdeparture[ ] from accepted standards of medical care or health\n\ncare.\u201d See Bioderm, 426 S.W.3d at 759. Thus, we must determine whether Lopez\u2019s claims\n\nalleging Guiding Light failed to provide T.L. and its employees with adequate supervision,\n\nadequate training, or a safe home environment implicate one or more of the standards listed in the\n\nAct\u2019s definition of a healthcare liability claim.\n\n       \u201cWhen a plaintiff only alleges ordinary negligence against a health care provider, courts\n\nhave concluded the plaintiff did not assert a safety standard-based\u201d healthcare liability claim. Tex.\n\nHealth Res. v. Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal, Inc., 552 S.W.3d 335, 340 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nDallas 2018), aff\u2019d, 595 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. 2020). \u201cThose cases generally involve injuries related\n\nto the health care provider\u2019s duties as a premises owner\u2014duties owed by any business premises\n\nowner to those lawfully entering the property\u2014and wholly unrelated to the rendition of health\n\ncare. Because there was no substantive nexus between the safety standards allegedly breached and\n\nthe provision of healthcare in those cases, the claims were not considered\u201d healthcare liability\n\nclaims. Id. (and cases cited therein). Unlike the allegations of ordinary negligence in these cases,\n\nLopez\u2019s allegations are not merely related to Guiding Light\u2019s duties as a premises owner or wholly\n\nunrelated to the rendition of health care. Guiding Light\u2019s alleged negligence is based on safety\n\nstandards uniquely arising from professional duties owed as a health care provider. See id. at 340.\n\nWe conclude Lopez alleged departures from safety standards that implicate Guiding Light\u2019s duties\n\nas a health care provider; therefore, Lopez asserts a healthcare liability claim. Our conclusion is\n\nfurther supported by the Ross Court\u2019s non-exclusive list of considerations for analyzing whether a\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nclaim is substantively related to a health care provider\u2019s provision of medical or health care and,\n\ntherefore, a healthcare liability claim.\n\n        Four of the Ross factors support our conclusion that Lopez asserts a safety standards-based\n\nhealthcare liability claim, two factors do not, and one does not apply because no instrumentality\n\nwas involved in the alleged negligence. As to the first and second factors, Lopez alleged Guiding\n\nLight failed to \u201cproperly oversee and supervise the young men entrusted to it\u201d while T.L. was\n\nliving at Guiding Light\u2019s facility. These allegations assert Guiding Light\u2019s alleged negligence\n\noccurred in the course of Guiding Light performing tasks with the purpose of protecting its\n\nresidents from harm in a place where residents might be during the time they were receiving care.\n\nTherefore, the first and second factors weigh in favor of finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a healthcare\n\nliability claim.\n\n        The third factor requires evidence that, at the time of the injury, T.L. was in the process of\n\nseeking or receiving health care. Guiding Light argued peer interaction and structured recreational\n\nexperiences with other residents was part of T.L.\u2019s treatment plan and, at the time of the incident,\n\nT.L. and other residents were in Guiding Light\u2019s living room area. On appeal, Guiding Light\n\nsuggests that \u201cwrestling with another resident in the living room area . . . certainly could be\n\nconsidered a recreational experience with peers of the type recommended by Lozano in T.L.\u2019s\n\ntreatment plan.\u201d Nothing in the record indicates any such recommendation was made and Guiding\n\nLight points to no other evidence that therapists or other healthcare workers were present during\n\nthe incident. Therefore, the third factor weighs against a finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a healthcare\n\nliability claim. The fourth factor also weighs against such a finding because there is no evidence\n\nGuiding Light was in the process of providing or assisting in providing health care when the\n\nincident occurred. The sixth factor does not apply because no instrumentality was involved in the\n\nalleged negligence.\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       The fifth and seventh factors require evidence regarding whether the alleged negligence\n\n(1) is based on safety standards arising from professional duties owed by Guiding Light and (2)\n\noccurred in the course of Guiding Light\u2019s taking action or failing to take action necessary to\n\ncomply with safety-related requirements set for health care providers by governmental or\n\naccrediting agencies. The gravamen of Lopez\u2019s claim is Guiding Light failed to provide adequate\n\nsupervision of T.L. and provide for a safe home environment, and failed to adequately train its\n\nstaff. These allegations implicate both an alleged departure from the accepted standards of safety,\n\nand that T.L.\u2019s health care provider violated the standard of health care owed to Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nresidents. Thus, the fifth and seventh factors weigh in favor of a finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a\n\nhealthcare liability claim.\n\n       Furthermore, expert testimony is necessary when the alleged negligence is of such a nature\n\nas not to be within the experience of laypersons. \u201c[I]n considering whether a claim alleges a\n\ndeparture from accepted standards of medical or health care, a court should first determine whether\n\nexpert medical or health care testimony is needed to establish the requisite standard of care and\n\nbreach.\u201d Bioderm, 426 S.W.3d at 760. \u201cAnd only if expert testimony is not needed should a court\n\nproceed to consider the totality of the circumstances, as a claim may still be a health care liability\n\nclaim despite that \u2018in the final analysis, expert testimony may not be necessary to support a\n\nverdict.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n       How a health care provider trains its employees and the steps a provider such as Guiding\n\nLight must take to ensure a safe environment for its residents would likely fall outside a layperson\u2019s\n\ncommon knowledge. The range of alternatives available to a provider such as Guiding Light\n\nrequires medical judgment to select and implement. We, therefore, conclude an expert was\n\nrequired at least as to some of the allegations in Lopez\u2019s petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       While not all the Ross factors indicate Lopez asserts a safety standards-based healthcare\n\nliability claim, the factors that do weigh strongly in favor of our conclusion that expert testimony\n\nis required to prove or refute his claim. See SunBridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, 160 S.W.3d\n\n230, 246 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2005, no pet.) (necessity of expert on issue of corporate funding,\n\nnursing home budgets, and staffing level standards); see also Rehabilitative Care Sys. of Am. v.\n\nDavis, 73 S.W.3d 233, 234 (Tex. 2002) (per curiam) (disapproving of court of appeals statement\n\nthat negligent supervision claim against physical therapist could be determined without the aid of\n\nexpert testimony). We therefore conclude the record before us does not rebut the presumption as\n\nit relates to the Act\u2019s expert report requirements.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Because Lopez\u2019s claim is a health care liability claim, it is subject to Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code section 74.351. Lopez was therefore required to timely file an expert report within\n\n120 days of Guiding Light\u2019s original answer. He failed to do so; consequently, the trial court\n\ncorrectly dismissed the suit with prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal with\n\nprejudice of Lopez\u2019s claims.\n\n                                                      Lori I.

Valenzuela, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: December 1, 2021\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n           This appeal arises from the trial court\u2019s granting of Guiding Light, LLC\u2019s Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code section 74.351 motion to dismiss the survival and wrongful death\n\nlawsuit filed against it by Enrique Lopez, Individually and as Representative of the Estate of\n\nTristen Lopez, Deceased (\u201cLopez\u201d). We affirm.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n           In August 2018, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (the\n\n\u201cDepartment\u201d) was granted temporary managing conservatorship of Lopez\u2019s fourteen-year-old\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nson, T.L. In that same month, T.L. was admitted to Renaissance Behavioral Center (\u201cRBC\u201d)\n\nbecause he made threats of suicide. RBC later recommended T.L. \u201cattend a residential treatment\n\ncenter to achieve maximum stability before attempting to place him with a foster family.\u201d On\n\nSeptember 4, 2018, T.L. was transferred to Guiding Light, which is a residential child-care facility\n\noperated pursuant to a contract with the Department. On the evening of September 16, T.L. and\n\nanother resident got into a physical altercation and a staff member called the Bexar County\n\nSheriff\u2019s Office. The events of the evening are disputed; however, the Sheriff\u2019s incident report\n\nindicates that when the deputies arrived, staff members were performing CPR on T.L. He was\n\ntransported to a hospital by EMS and died fifteen days later.\n\n        Lopez sued Guiding Light alleging wrongful death and survival claims. Lopez contended\n\nit was unclear whether T.L. died at the hands of the other resident or one of the staff members\n\nattempting to end the fight. He alleged Guiding Light was negligent because it failed to (1)\n\nproperly and adequately train and supervise its employees; (2) oversee and supervise the young\n\nmen entrusted to Guiding Light; and (3) exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of\n\ninjury to others.\n\n        Guiding Light answered and filed its motion to dismiss, alleging Lopez\u2019s suit should be\n\ndismissed with prejudice because he failed to serve an expert report within the 120-day deadline\n\nset forth in section 74.351(a). Lopez responded that he was not required to file an expert report\n\nbecause Guiding Light was not a health care provider and his claim was not a health-care liability\n\nclaim. The trial court conducted a hearing, and later signed an order granting Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice and awarding Guiding Light attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal ensued.\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Generally, we review a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying a motion to dismiss under\n\nsection 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code for an abuse of discretion. Am.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nTransitional Care Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d 873, 875 (Tex. 2001). However,\n\nwhether a petition asserts a health care liability claim under the statute is a question of law\n\nreviewed de novo. See Tex. W. Oaks Hosp., LP v. Williams, 371 S.W.3d 171, 177 (Tex. 2012);\n\nHeriberto Sedeno, P.A. v. Mijares, 333 S.W.3d 815, 818 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2010,\n\nno pet.). \u201c[W]hen making that determination courts should consider the entire court record,\n\nincluding the pleadings, motions and responses, and relevant evidence properly admitted.\u201d\n\nLoaisiga v. Cerda, 379 S.W.3d 248, 258 (Tex. 2012).\n\n             APPLICABILITY OF THE TEXAS MEDICAL LIABILITY ACT\n\n       Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 74, also known as the Texas Medical Liability\n\nAct (the \u201cAct\u201d), requires health care liability claimants to serve an expert report upon each\n\ndefendant not later than 120 days after that defendant\u2019s answer is filed. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE \u00a7 74.351(a). The purpose of the expert report requirement is to weed out frivolous\n\nmalpractice claims in the early stages of litigation, not to dispose of potentially meritorious claims.\n\nPalacios, 46 S.W.3d at 877; see also Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 258 (\u201c[Expert report] requirements\n\nare meant to identify frivolous claims and reduce the expense and time to dispose of any that are\n\nfiled.\u201d). In accordance with that purpose, the Act provides a mechanism for dismissal of the\n\nclaimant\u2019s suit in the event of an untimely or deficient report. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.351(b); see also Abshire v. Christus Health Se. Tex., 563 S.W.3d 219, 223 (Tex. 2018). \u201cIf,\n\nas to a defendant physician or health care provider, an expert report has not been served within the\n\nperiod specified by Subsection (a), the court, on the motion of the affected physician or health care\n\nprovider, shall, subject to Subsection (c), enter an order that:\n\n       (1) awards to the affected physician or health care provider reasonable attorney\u2019s\n       fees and costs of court incurred by the physician or health care provider; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       (2) dismisses the claim with respect to the physician or health care provider, with\n       prejudice to the refiling of the claim.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.351(b).\n\n       \u201cThe broad language of the [Act] evidences legislative intent for the statute to have\n\nexpansive application.\u201d Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 256. \u201cThe breadth of the statute\u2019s text essentially\n\ncreates a presumption that a claim is [a healthcare liability claim] if it is against a physician or\n\nhealth care provider and is based on facts implicating the defendant\u2019s conduct during the course\n\nof a patient\u2019s care, treatment, or confinement.\u201d Id. \u201cBut the presumption is necessarily rebuttable.\u201d\n\nId. \u201cIn some instances the only possible relationship between the conduct underlying a claim and\n\nthe rendition of medical services or healthcare will be the healthcare setting (i.e., the physical\n\nlocation of the conduct in a health care facility), the defendant\u2019s status as a doctor or health care\n\nprovider, or both.\u201d Id.\n\n       A healthcare liability claim contains three basic elements: (1) a physician or health care\n\nprovider must be a defendant; (2) the claim or claims at issue must concern treatment, lack of\n\ntreatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical care, or health care, or safety or\n\nprofessional or administrative services directly related to health care; and (3) the defendant\u2019s act\n\nor omission complained of must proximately cause the injury to the claimant. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(a)(13).\n\n       In this case, Lopez did not file an expert report, and the trial court dismissed his suit with\n\nprejudice. On appeal, Lopez contends he was not required to file an expert report because Guiding\n\nLight failed to establish the Act applies to his claims. Lopez argues (1) Guiding Light is not a\n\nhealth care provider and (2) he is not asserting a health care liability claim. Guiding Light had the\n\nburden of establishing that it is a health care provider. Akhter v. Smooth Sols.

CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(a)(13) (defining \u201chealth care liability claim\u201d).\n\nGuiding Light must be a health care provider for the rebuttable presumption to apply. See Bioderm\n\nSkin Care, LLC v. Sok, 426 S.W.3d 753, 758 (Tex. 2014). The Act defines \u201chealth care\u201d to mean\n\n\u201cany act or treatment performed or furnished, or that should have been performed or furnished, by\n\nany health care provider for, to, or on behalf of a patient during the patient\u2019s medical care,\n\ntreatment, or confinement.\u201d TEX.

Is Guiding Light a Health Care Provider? 2\n\n         As described above, the Act defines \u201chealth care provider\u201d as a \u201ccorporation . . . duly\n\nlicensed, certified, registered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care,\u201d including\n\ncertain persons and entities expressly listed. Id. \u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A). \u201cIt is clear from the language\n\nof section 74.001(a)(12)(A) that the general requirement of being \u2018duly licensed, certified,\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Guiding Light also contends its \u201cLicensed Professional Counselor\u201d (\u201cLPC\u201d), Treatment Director Manuel Lozano Jr.,\nMS, is a health care provider. However, Lopez did not file suit against Lozano; therefore, his alleged status as a\nhealthcare provider is not relevant to whether Guiding Light is a healthcare provider.\n2\n  For the first time on appeal, Lopez raises several objections to certain exhibits attached to Guiding Light\u2019s motion\nto dismiss. Because none of the objections were brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, they are waived.\n\n\n                                                        -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nregistered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care\u2019 is primary to any consideration\n\nrespecting similarity to the persons and entities expressly listed thereafter.\u201d Lutheran Soc.

Therefore, we begin our analysis by considering whether Guiding\n\nLight demonstrated it meets the general requirement of being \u201cduly licensed, certified, registered,\n\nor chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care.\u201d See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A).\n\n       On appeal, Lopez urges this court to apply the reasoning in Shiloh Treatment Center, Inc.\n\nv. Ward, 510 S.W.3d 36 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.), to reverse the trial court\u2019s\n\ndismissal of his claim against Guiding Light. In that case, Shiloh Treatment\u2019s license specifically\n\nlisted: \u201cType[s] of Treatment Services[:] Emotional Disorders[,] Mental Retardation[, and]\n\nPervasive Developmental Disorders.\u201d Shiloh Treatment argued that because its child-care license\n\nincluded \u201ctreatment services,\u201d it was \u201clicensed . . . to provide health care\u201d pursuant to the Act. Id.\n\nat 39. Shiloh Treatment also relied on the regulatory definition of \u201cresidential treatment center\u201d\n\nas \u201c[a] general residential operation for 13 or more children or young adults that exclusively\n\nprovides treatment services for children with emotional disorders.\u201d Id. at *4 (citing 40 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE \u00a7 748.43(40)).\n\n       The court of appeals disagreed and concluded Shiloh Treatment was \u201cnot licensed to be\n\nanything other than a residential treatment center\u201d and Shiloh Treatment had provided no evidence\n\nof what treatment services it provided. Id. In rejecting Shiloh Treatment\u2019s arguments, the court\n\nof appeals stated in part, \u201c[a]lthough Shiloh Treatment was authorized to provide treatment\n\nservices for emotional disorders, this alone cannot be enough to make it a health care provider.\u201d\n\nId. at 40. The court observed (1) the regulatory definition cited by Shiloh Treatment \u201csays nothing\n\nabout the kind or degree of treatment services rendered\u201d and (2) although mental care facilities\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nlicensed under certain provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code are specifically identified\n\nin the Act as \u201chealth care providers,\u201d Shiloh Treatment was not licensed under those provisions,\n\nbut rather was licensed pursuant to the Human Resources Code. Id. The court also reasoned that\n\nwhile \u201c[a] pedicurist may be said to \u2018treat\u2019 a callous; a yoga instructor may be said to \u2018treat\u2019\n\nanxiety; [and] a teacher may be said to \u2018treat\u2019 a learning difference,\u201d \u201cnone are automatically health\n\ncare providers rendering medical treatment to patients.\u201d Id.

(licensed professional counselor was health care provider because she was licensed to provide\n\nmedical treatment to patients)). Additionally, the court stated in part,\n\n           . . . According to [the Department], treatment services are \u201ca specialized type\n       of child-care services designed to treat and/or support children.\u201d . . . \u201cChild-care\n       services [means] services that meet a child\u2019s basic need for shelter, nutrition,\n       clothing, nurture, socialization, and interpersonal skills, care for personal health and\n       hygiene, supervision, education, and service planning.\u201d . . . This suggests that\n       these services are general in nature and not medical services.\n\n                                               ...\n\n           In addition, the record contains no evidence that Shiloh Treatment actually\n       provided any medical care or treatment to Ward or any other person. There is no\n       indication of how many members of Shiloh\u2019s staff, if any, were medical personnel.\n       There is no evidence regarding the extent that medical personnel controlled or\n       influenced any child-care services rendered to Ward. There is no medical\n       documentation from Shiloh Treatment in the record. . ..\n\n                                               ...\n\n          Given the sparse record evidence, we cannot conclude that Shiloh Treatment\n       was \u201cduly licensed, certified, registered, or chartered by the State of Texas to\n       provide health care.\u201d\n\nId. at 39-40 (citations omitted).\n\n       As in Shiloh, Guiding Light asserted that it is licensed by the Texas Health and Human\n\nServices Commission and \u201chas been issued a license to operate as a General Residential Operation\n\n\u2013 Residential Treatment Center Under the Provisions of Chapter 42, Human Resources Code.\u201d\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       As a \u201cGeneral Residential Operation\u2014Residential Treatment Center\u201d and, as part of its\n\nlicensing and pursuant to Texas Human Resources Code section 40.058, it entered into a\n\nResidential Child-Care Contract with the Department. Whether Guiding Light is a health care\n\nprovider requires this court to examine the type of operation Guiding Light was licensed to operate\n\nand determine the type of services it was licensed to provide. The answers to these questions are\n\nfound in the Texas Human Resources Code and the Texas Administrative Code.\n\n       1.

Therefore, the next question is whether Guiding Light provided evidence to the trial\n\ncourt that it actually provided such treatment to T.L. See Shiloh, 510 S.W.3d at 39 (\u201cIn addition,\n\nthe record contains no evidence that Shiloh Treatment actually provided any medical care or\n\ntreatment to Ward or any other person.\u201d).\n\nB.     Did Guiding Light Provide Mental Health Treatment?\n\n       The Department\u2019s \u201cApplication for Placement of Children in Residential Care\u201d indicated\n\nT.L. had \u201cmental health needs requiring treatment.\u201d The application recommended \u201cspecialized\u201d\n\nlevel of care because T.L. had suicidal ideations/self-harming behaviors, had been diagnosed with\n\nADHD, Tourette\u2019s Disorder, and major depression \u201cepisode without psychosis.\u201d He also was\n\nalleged to have a history of assaultive behavior, including choking his two-year-old female sibling\n\nand killing animals. The application listed the immediate goals of placement as providing T.L.\n\nwith a safe environment, the basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. Long term goals included\n\nproviding him \u201cwith extensive therapy to address the underlying issues that led to the removal and\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nto provide the child with life techniques so that he can have an opportunity to become a productive\n\ncitizen.\u201d\n\n        As outlined, Guiding Light\u2019s admission assessment of T.L. listed his level of care as\n\n\u201cspecialized,\u201d and noted the same history as contained in the Department\u2019s application. The\n\nassessment noted: \u201c[T.L.] has mental health needs requiring treatment. [T.L.] is diagnosed with\n\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder of the Combined Presentation and Major depressive\n\ndisorder, Recurrent episode, Severe without psychosis. [T.L.] has no substance abuse history.\u201d\n\nThe assessment stated T.L. would \u201cbe examined by a physician while in placement at Guiding\n\nLight to determine medical needs\u201d and as follows:\n\n        V. OBJECTIVE OF PLACEMENT The objectives of this placement are to protect\n        [T.L.] from abuse and neglect and to provide [T.L.] with care that meets his needs\n        for permanency and belonging.\n\n        BASIC NEEDS [T.L.] has basic needs and requires food, shelter, and clothing; He\n        will also receive routine medical and dental care, a safe stimulating and nurturing\n        home environment that will include friendships and recreational activities.\n\n        Short-term Goals of Placement: The short-term goals of this placement are for\n        [T.L.] to receive regular medical and dental care, and be provided with a safe\n        environment. [T.L.] will be emotionally stable and demonstrate good social skills.\n        [T.L.] will attend school regularly and participate in social and recreational\n        activities.\n\n        Long-term Goals of Placement: [T.L.\u2019s] long term goal for placement is\n        independent living skills and to maintain overall good physical, dental and medical\n        health. [T.L.] will demonstrate behavioral control and maintain positive\n        relationships. [T.L.] will learn to verbalize his feelings appropriately. Also, [T.L.]\n        will successfully complete school and will demonstrate good social skills.\n\n        The assessment stated T.L. would \u201creceive anger management techniques, problems\n\nsolving skills, and learn to interact positively with peers to de-escalate negative behaviors.\u201d\n\nGuiding Light\u2019s staff would \u201cpositively redirect [T.L.\u2019s] behavior by being consistent with the\n\nfacility\u2019s rules and consequences, as well as promoting fair practices[; and p]rovide commands\n\nthat are brief, calm, and non-confrontational.\u201d The assessment also stated Guiding Light\u2019s\n\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\ntherapist would \u201cmaintain regular individual and group therapy sessions to address [T.L.\u2019s]\n\nbehavior, problems solving skills, positive interactions with peers, impulse control, and provide\n\nanger management techniques.\u201d\n\n       Guiding Light also provided a \u201c72-Hour Treatment Plan,\u201d which stated: \u201c[T.L.] will need\n\ncoping skills/techniques to help to manage his anger and obtain positive social skills, increase\n\nimpulse control as well as problem solving and decision-making techniques.\u201d The plan described\n\nT.L.\u2019s \u201ctreatment services\u201d as follows:\n\n           [T.L.] will receive individual therapy to work on his aggression, impulsivity,\n       depression and suicidal ideation. He will also need to understand how his actions\n       produce both negative and positive consequences from the caregivers. [T.L.] needs\n       to be involved in a structured recreational experience with peers in order to practice\n       positive social skills and develop friends. His therapy would also address [T.L.\u2019s]\n       cognitive/academic needs and/or deficits.\n\n                                              ...\n\n          [T.L.] will receive weekly individual and group therapy. He will also receive\n       appropriate psychological evaluations and monthly medication monitoring.\n\n       The plan listed the same responsibilities for its staff and therapists as listed on the\n\nadmission assessment. The \u201ctransitional living\u201d section of the plan stated\n\n           As a resident of Guiding Light Residential Treatment Center, [T.L.] will\n       participates [sic] in individual therapy, group therapy, and staff daily groups that\n       will teach him problem solving, stress management, assessing consequences,\n       establishing goals and planning for the future. While at Guiding Light he will be\n       required to complete weekly chores such as washing dishes, sweeping, mopping,\n       taking the trash out, cleaning windows and/or assisting with setting the table, this\n       will teach him everyday life skills. Once [T.L.] turns 16 y/o, his caseworker will\n       submit a referral to PAL classes and a referral for Circle Of Support.\n\n       An \u201cIndividual Therapeutic Services Report,\u201d completed by Guiding Light\u2019s Treatment\n\nDirector, Manuel Lozano Jr., who is a licensed professional counselor, stated\n\n          This therapist [Lozano] inquired about what [T.L.] feels he needs to focus on\n       while in treatment. [T.L.] reported that he feels he needs to focus on \u201cDepression\n       and Anger.\u201d This therapist explained to [T.L.] that he and this therapist would\n       explore his behaviors, recommendations from [the Department], and put together a\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n        treatment plan. This therapist reviewed the expectations of the facility and how to\n        successfully adjust to the facility. This therapist also reviewed the rules of the\n        facility. [T.L.] indicated that he understood and added that if he can\u2019t stay here\n        until he is 18 years old he will probably go to a foster home. Rapport was\n        established.\n                                              ...\n\n            [T.L.] is seen in individual therapy on a weekly basis for 45 minute sessions.\n        The sessions take place in the RTC. He also participates in 45-minute group session\n        on a weekly basis.\n\n        Finally, Guiding Light attached to its motion to dismiss the affidavits of Lozano and its\n\nExecutive Director, Phyllis Bartell. Lozano attested he held three individual therapy sessions with\n\nT.L. in September 2018 and created T.L.\u2019s treatment plan based on T.L.\u2019s medical history and\n\nindividual interview sessions. Lozano also stated that, in addition to his services, the medical team\n\nconsists of a psychiatrist, who is available via Telemed and sees each resident once every sixty\n\ndays or as needed, to assist in treating the psychiatric wellbeing of the residents. Bartell attested\n\nthat \u201c[p]sychiatric treatment through our psychiatrist consultant & his/her colleagues is available\n\n24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d\n\n        We conclude Guiding Light established it is a health care provider based on (1) its license\n\nto provide \u201ctreatment services\u201d for \u201cemotional disorders,\u201d (2) the Department\u2019s application for\n\nplacement that listed as a long term goal providing T.L. \u201cwith extensive therapy to address the\n\nunderlying issues that led to the removal and to provide the child with life techniques so that he\n\ncan have an opportunity to become a productive citizen,\u201d (3) its contract with the Department to\n\nprovide these services, and (4) the evidence that it did, in fact, provide these services to T.L.\n\nTherefore, we next examine whether Lopez\u2019s claim is based on facts implicating Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nconduct during T.L.\u2019s care and treatment. If it is, then we apply the rebuttable presumption that\n\nthe claim is a health care liability claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f                                                                                        04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n                             HEALTH CARE LIABILITY CLAIM\n\n        One of the elements of a healthcare liability claim is that the claim or claims at issue must\n\nconcern treatment, lack of treatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical care, or\n\nhealth care, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health care. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE \u00a7 74.001(a)(13).\n\n        Generally, we review a trial court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to timely\n\nfile a section 74.351(a) expert report under an abuse of discretion standard; however, \u201c[t]he nature\n\nof the claims the Legislature intended to include under the [Act\u2019s] umbrella is a matter of statutory\n\nconstruction, a legal question we review de novo.\u201d Tex. W.

In determining whether Lopez\u2019s claim is a health care\n\nliability claim, we focus on the underlying nature of the cause of action and we are not bound by\n\nthe pleadings. Diversicare, 185 S.W.3d at 847. Artful pleading does not alter that nature. Yamada\n\nv. Friend, 335 S.W.3d 192, 196 (Tex. 2010). A claim based on one set of facts cannot be spliced\n\nor divided into both a healthcare liability claim and another type of claim. See id. at 197;\n\nDiversicare, 185 S.W.3d at 854. Thus, claims premised on facts that could support claims against\n\na physician or health care provider for departures from accepted standards of medical care, health\n\n\n                                                 - 17 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\ncare, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health care are\n\nhealthcare liability claims, regardless of whether the plaintiff alleges the defendant is liable for\n\nbreach of any of those standards. See Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 255.\n\n       \u201cIn defining the types of claims against health care providers constituting [health care\n\nliability claims], the question we face is not whether it seems that a claimed injury really arose\n\nfrom treatment commonly understood to be some type of medical or health care; nor do we address\n\nwhether the incident causing the injury would have been a common law negligence claim.\u201d Tex.\n\nW. Oaks Hosp., 371 S.W.3d at 179. \u201cInstead, the issue posed is whether the umbrella fashioned\n\nby the Legislature\u2019s promulgation of the [Act] includes the cause of action brought by a claimant\n\nagainst physicians or health care providers.\u201d Id. \u201c[W]e determine whether the relevant allegations\n\nare negligence claims or are properly characterized as [healthcare liability claims] under the Act.\u201d\n\nId. In making the determination, we consider the entire court record, including the pleadings,\n\nmotions and responses, and relevant evidence properly admitted. Id. at 258.\n\n       There are several types of healthcare liability claims set forth in the Act. In addition to\n\nclaims involving treatment and lack of treatment, the Act contemplates claims for alleged\n\n\u201cdeparture[s] from accepted standards of medical care, or health care, or safety or professional or\n\nadministrative services directly related to health care.\u201d       TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.001(a)(13) (emphasis added). All these categories of claims, except safety, are defined terms\n\nin the Act. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 74.001(a)(10), (a)(19), and (a)(24) (defining \u201chealth care,\u201d \u201cmedical\n\ncare,\u201d and \u201cprofessional or administrative services\u201d). Guiding Light asserts Lopez\u2019s claims allege\n\ndepartures from accepted standards of \u201csafety.\u201d Lopez argues his claim is for ordinary negligence\n\nand his claim relates to Guiding Light\u2019s failure to act as a reasonably prudent child-care center\n\nwould under the same or similar circumstances in its supervision of T.L.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                        04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n          The Act \u201cdoes not specifically state that a safety standards-based claim falls within its\n\nprovisions only if the claim has some relationship to the provision of health care other than the\n\nlocation of the occurrence, the status of the defendant, or both.\u201d Ross v. St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal\n\nHosp., 462 S.W.3d 496, 504 (Tex. 2015). \u201cBut the Legislature must have intended such a\n\nrelationship to be necessary, given the legislative intent explicitly set out in the [Act] and the\n\ncontext in which \u2018safety\u2019 is used in the statute.\u201d Id. The Ross Court concluded that, \u201c[c]onsidering\n\nthe purpose of the statute, the context of the language at issue, and the rule of ejusdem generis, . . .\n\nthe safety standards referred to in the definition are those that have a substantive relationship with\n\nthe providing of medical or health care.\u201d Id. \u201cAnd if it were not so, the broad meaning of \u2018safety\u2019\n\nwould afford defendant health care providers a special procedural advantage in the guise of\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to file expert reports in their suits regardless of whether their cause of action\n\nimplicated the provision of medical or health care.\u201d Id. The Court did not believe the Legislature\n\nintended the statute to have such arbitrary results. See id.\n\n          \u201cThe pivotal issue in a safety standards-based claim is whether the standards on which the\n\nclaim is based implicate the defendant\u2019s duties as a health care provider, including its duties to\n\nprovide for patient safety.\u201d Id. at 505. The line between a safety standards-based claim that is not\n\na healthcare liability claim and one that is \u201cmay not always be clear.\u201d Id. \u201cBut certain non-\n\nexclusive considerations lend themselves to analyzing whether such a claim is substantively\n\nrelated to the defendant\u2019s providing of medical or health care and is therefore a healthcare liability\n\nclaim\u201d:\n\n          1. Did the alleged negligence of the defendant occur in the course of the defendant\u2019s\n          performing tasks with the purpose of protecting patients from harm;\n          2. Did the injuries occur in a place where patients might be during the time they\n          were receiving care, so that the obligation of the provider to protect persons who\n          require special, medical care was implicated;\n          3. At the time of the injury was the claimant in the process of seeking or receiving\n          health care;\n\n\n                                                  - 19 -\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       4. At the time of the injury was the claimant providing or assisting in providing\n       health care;\n       5. Is the alleged negligence based on safety standards arising from professional\n       duties owed by the health care provider;\n       6. If an instrumentality was involved in the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, was it\n       a type used in providing health care; or\n       7. Did the alleged negligence occur in the course of the defendant\u2019s taking action\n       or failing to take action necessary to comply with safety-related requirements set\n       for health care providers by governmental or accrediting agencies?\n\nId.\n\n       \u201cWhen we examine these factors or considerations, we focus on the essence of the cause\n\nof action.\u201d Nexion Health Mgmt., Inc. v. Waddell, 05-20-00406-CV, 2020 WL 7767938, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Dec. 30, 2020, no pet.) (mem. op.). \u201cFor example, is the claim an ordinary\n\nnegligence claim or is the claim a health care liability claim as contemplated by the Legislature\n\nwhen it provided for health care liability claims in the [Act]?\u201d Id. Here, the pivotal issue is whether\n\nthe safety standards implicated Guiding Light\u2019s duties as a health care provider.\n\n       In his petition, Lopez brought a negligence claim against Guiding Light based on the\n\nfollowing factual allegations:\n\n           This case arises out of a catastrophic incident that occurred at a group home for\n       young men on or around September 16, 2018 in San Antonio, Texas. On that date,\n       [T.L.] was fatally injured while living at a group home owned and operated by the\n       Defendant and located at 17602 Tucker Place, San Antonio, Texas 78221.\n       Specifically, and based on information and belief, [T.L.] and other young men at\n       the home were not adequately supervised, began to fight, and during the fight or\n       soon after, [T.L.] passed away. It is unclear at this time whether [T.L.] died at the\n       hands of another young man living at the home or at the hands of one of the\n       employees attempting to break up the fight. Either way, Guiding Light failed to\n       provide [T.L.] and its employees with adequate supervision, adequate training, or a\n       safe home environment.\n\n       Lopez alleged Guiding Light breached its duty of care by failing to (1) properly and\n\nadequately train and supervise its employees; (2) properly oversee and supervise the young men\n\nentrusted to it; and (3) exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to others.\n\nBecause we have already determined Lopez\u2019s claim satisfies the first element of a health care\n\n\n                                                 - 20 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nliability claim because Guiding Light is a health care provider, and Guiding Light did not dispute\n\nthat the third element of a health care liability claim (causation of the injury) was not satisfied,\n\nLopez may only rebut the presumption that his claim is a health care liability claim by proving his\n\nclaim does not constitute an alleged \u201cdeparture[ ] from accepted standards of medical care or health\n\ncare.\u201d See Bioderm, 426 S.W.3d at 759. Thus, we must determine whether Lopez\u2019s claims\n\nalleging Guiding Light failed to provide T.L. and its employees with adequate supervision,\n\nadequate training, or a safe home environment implicate one or more of the standards listed in the\n\nAct\u2019s definition of a healthcare liability claim.\n\n       \u201cWhen a plaintiff only alleges ordinary negligence against a health care provider, courts\n\nhave concluded the plaintiff did not assert a safety standard-based\u201d healthcare liability claim. Tex.\n\nHealth Res. v. Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal, Inc., 552 S.W.3d 335, 340 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nDallas 2018), aff\u2019d, 595 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. 2020). \u201cThose cases generally involve injuries related\n\nto the health care provider\u2019s duties as a premises owner\u2014duties owed by any business premises\n\nowner to those lawfully entering the property\u2014and wholly unrelated to the rendition of health\n\ncare. Because there was no substantive nexus between the safety standards allegedly breached and\n\nthe provision of healthcare in those cases, the claims were not considered\u201d healthcare liability\n\nclaims. Id. (and cases cited therein). Unlike the allegations of ordinary negligence in these cases,\n\nLopez\u2019s allegations are not merely related to Guiding Light\u2019s duties as a premises owner or wholly\n\nunrelated to the rendition of health care. Guiding Light\u2019s alleged negligence is based on safety\n\nstandards uniquely arising from professional duties owed as a health care provider. See id. at 340.\n\nWe conclude Lopez alleged departures from safety standards that implicate Guiding Light\u2019s duties\n\nas a health care provider; therefore, Lopez asserts a healthcare liability claim. Our conclusion is\n\nfurther supported by the Ross Court\u2019s non-exclusive list of considerations for analyzing whether a\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nclaim is substantively related to a health care provider\u2019s provision of medical or health care and,\n\ntherefore, a healthcare liability claim.\n\n        Four of the Ross factors support our conclusion that Lopez asserts a safety standards-based\n\nhealthcare liability claim, two factors do not, and one does not apply because no instrumentality\n\nwas involved in the alleged negligence. As to the first and second factors, Lopez alleged Guiding\n\nLight failed to \u201cproperly oversee and supervise the young men entrusted to it\u201d while T.L. was\n\nliving at Guiding Light\u2019s facility. These allegations assert Guiding Light\u2019s alleged negligence\n\noccurred in the course of Guiding Light performing tasks with the purpose of protecting its\n\nresidents from harm in a place where residents might be during the time they were receiving care.\n\nTherefore, the first and second factors weigh in favor of finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a healthcare\n\nliability claim.\n\n        The third factor requires evidence that, at the time of the injury, T.L. was in the process of\n\nseeking or receiving health care. Guiding Light argued peer interaction and structured recreational\n\nexperiences with other residents was part of T.L.\u2019s treatment plan and, at the time of the incident,\n\nT.L. and other residents were in Guiding Light\u2019s living room area. On appeal, Guiding Light\n\nsuggests that \u201cwrestling with another resident in the living room area . . . certainly could be\n\nconsidered a recreational experience with peers of the type recommended by Lozano in T.L.\u2019s\n\ntreatment plan.\u201d Nothing in the record indicates any such recommendation was made and Guiding\n\nLight points to no other evidence that therapists or other healthcare workers were present during\n\nthe incident. Therefore, the third factor weighs against a finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a healthcare\n\nliability claim. The fourth factor also weighs against such a finding because there is no evidence\n\nGuiding Light was in the process of providing or assisting in providing health care when the\n\nincident occurred. The sixth factor does not apply because no instrumentality was involved in the\n\nalleged negligence.\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       The fifth and seventh factors require evidence regarding whether the alleged negligence\n\n(1) is based on safety standards arising from professional duties owed by Guiding Light and (2)\n\noccurred in the course of Guiding Light\u2019s taking action or failing to take action necessary to\n\ncomply with safety-related requirements set for health care providers by governmental or\n\naccrediting agencies. The gravamen of Lopez\u2019s claim is Guiding Light failed to provide adequate\n\nsupervision of T.L. and provide for a safe home environment, and failed to adequately train its\n\nstaff. These allegations implicate both an alleged departure from the accepted standards of safety,\n\nand that T.L.\u2019s health care provider violated the standard of health care owed to Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nresidents. Thus, the fifth and seventh factors weigh in favor of a finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a\n\nhealthcare liability claim.\n\n       Furthermore, expert testimony is necessary when the alleged negligence is of such a nature\n\nas not to be within the experience of laypersons. \u201c[I]n considering whether a claim alleges a\n\ndeparture from accepted standards of medical or health care, a court should first determine whether\n\nexpert medical or health care testimony is needed to establish the requisite standard of care and\n\nbreach.\u201d Bioderm, 426 S.W.3d at 760. \u201cAnd only if expert testimony is not needed should a court\n\nproceed to consider the totality of the circumstances, as a claim may still be a health care liability\n\nclaim despite that \u2018in the final analysis, expert testimony may not be necessary to support a\n\nverdict.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n       How a health care provider trains its employees and the steps a provider such as Guiding\n\nLight must take to ensure a safe environment for its residents would likely fall outside a layperson\u2019s\n\ncommon knowledge. The range of alternatives available to a provider such as Guiding Light\n\nrequires medical judgment to select and implement. We, therefore, conclude an expert was\n\nrequired at least as to some of the allegations in Lopez\u2019s petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       While not all the Ross factors indicate Lopez asserts a safety standards-based healthcare\n\nliability claim, the factors that do weigh strongly in favor of our conclusion that expert testimony\n\nis required to prove or refute his claim. See SunBridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, 160 S.W.3d\n\n230, 246 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2005, no pet.) (necessity of expert on issue of corporate funding,\n\nnursing home budgets, and staffing level standards); see also Rehabilitative Care Sys. of Am. v.\n\nDavis, 73 S.W.3d 233, 234 (Tex. 2002) (per curiam) (disapproving of court of appeals statement\n\nthat negligent supervision claim against physical therapist could be determined without the aid of\n\nexpert testimony). We therefore conclude the record before us does not rebut the presumption as\n\nit relates to the Act\u2019s expert report requirements.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Because Lopez\u2019s claim is a health care liability claim, it is subject to Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code section 74.351. Lopez was therefore required to timely file an expert report within\n\n120 days of Guiding Light\u2019s original answer. He failed to do so; consequently, the trial court\n\ncorrectly dismissed the suit with prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal with\n\nprejudice of Lopez\u2019s claims.\n\n                                                      Lori I.

We affirm.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n           In August 2018, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (the\n\n\u201cDepartment\u201d) was granted temporary managing conservatorship of Lopez\u2019s fourteen-year-old\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nson, T.L. In that same month, T.L. was admitted to Renaissance Behavioral Center (\u201cRBC\u201d)\n\nbecause he made threats of suicide. RBC later recommended T.L. \u201cattend a residential treatment\n\ncenter to achieve maximum stability before attempting to place him with a foster family.\u201d On\n\nSeptember 4, 2018, T.L. was transferred to Guiding Light, which is a residential child-care facility\n\noperated pursuant to a contract with the Department. On the evening of September 16, T.L. and\n\nanother resident got into a physical altercation and a staff member called the Bexar County\n\nSheriff\u2019s Office. The events of the evening are disputed; however, the Sheriff\u2019s incident report\n\nindicates that when the deputies arrived, staff members were performing CPR on T.L. He was\n\ntransported to a hospital by EMS and died fifteen days later.\n\n        Lopez sued Guiding Light alleging wrongful death and survival claims. Lopez contended\n\nit was unclear whether T.L. died at the hands of the other resident or one of the staff members\n\nattempting to end the fight. He alleged Guiding Light was negligent because it failed to (1)\n\nproperly and adequately train and supervise its employees; (2) oversee and supervise the young\n\nmen entrusted to Guiding Light; and (3) exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of\n\ninjury to others.\n\n        Guiding Light answered and filed its motion to dismiss, alleging Lopez\u2019s suit should be\n\ndismissed with prejudice because he failed to serve an expert report within the 120-day deadline\n\nset forth in section 74.351(a). Lopez responded that he was not required to file an expert report\n\nbecause Guiding Light was not a health care provider and his claim was not a health-care liability\n\nclaim. The trial court conducted a hearing, and later signed an order granting Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice and awarding Guiding Light attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal ensued.\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Generally, we review a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying a motion to dismiss under\n\nsection 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code for an abuse of discretion.

However, Lopez did not file suit against Lozano; therefore, his alleged status as a\nhealthcare provider is not relevant to whether Guiding Light is a healthcare provider.\n2\n  For the first time on appeal, Lopez raises several objections to certain exhibits attached to Guiding Light\u2019s motion\nto dismiss. Because none of the objections were brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, they are waived.\n\n\n                                                        -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nregistered, or chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care\u2019 is primary to any consideration\n\nrespecting similarity to the persons and entities expressly listed thereafter.\u201d Lutheran Soc.

App.\u2014Dallas Mar. 14,\n\n2016, pet. denied) (mem. op.). Therefore, we begin our analysis by considering whether Guiding\n\nLight demonstrated it meets the general requirement of being \u201cduly licensed, certified, registered,\n\nor chartered by the State of Texas to provide health care.\u201d See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n\u00a7 74.001(a)(12)(A).\n\n       On appeal, Lopez urges this court to apply the reasoning in Shiloh Treatment Center, Inc.\n\nv. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">510 S.W.3d 36</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.), to reverse the trial court\u2019s\n\ndismissal of his claim against Guiding Light. In that case, Shiloh Treatment\u2019s license specifically\n\nlisted: \u201cType[s] of Treatment Services[:] Emotional Disorders[,] Mental Retardation[, and]\n\nPervasive Developmental Disorders.\u201d Shiloh Treatment argued that because its child-care license\n\nincluded \u201ctreatment services,\u201d it was \u201clicensed . . . to provide health care\u201d pursuant to the Act. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\n\nat 39</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Shiloh Treatment also relied on the regulatory definition of \u201cresidential treatment center\u201d\n\nas \u201c[a] general residential operation for 13 or more children or young adults that exclusively\n\nprovides treatment services for children with emotional disorders.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *4</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (citing 40 TEX.\n\nADMIN. CODE \u00a7 748.43(40)).\n\n       The court of appeals disagreed and concluded Shiloh Treatment was \u201cnot licensed to be\n\nanything other than a residential treatment center\u201d and Shiloh Treatment had provided no evidence\n\nof what treatment services it provided. Id. In rejecting Shiloh Treatment\u2019s arguments, the court\n\nof appeals stated in part, \u201c[a]lthough Shiloh Treatment was authorized to provide treatment\n\nservices for emotional disorders, this alone cannot be enough to make it a health care provider.\u201d\n\nId. at 40. The court observed (1) the regulatory definition cited by Shiloh Treatment \u201csays nothing\n\nabout the kind or degree of treatment services rendered\u201d and (2) although mental care facilities\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nlicensed under certain provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code are specifically identified\n\nin the Act as \u201chealth care providers,\u201d Shiloh Treatment was not licensed under those provisions,\n\nbut rather was licensed pursuant to the Human Resources Code. Id. The court also reasoned that\n\nwhile \u201c[a] pedicurist may be said to \u2018treat\u2019 a callous; a yoga instructor may be said to \u2018treat\u2019\n\nanxiety; [and] a teacher may be said to \u2018treat\u2019 a learning difference,\u201d \u201cnone are automatically health\n\ncare providers rendering medical treatment to patients.\u201d Id.

Additionally, the court stated in part,\n\n           . . .

This suggests that\n       these services are general in nature and not medical services.\n\n                                               ...\n\n           In addition, the record contains no evidence that Shiloh Treatment actually\n       provided any medical care or treatment to Ward or any other person.

Whether Guiding Light is a health care\n\nprovider requires this court to examine the type of operation Guiding Light was licensed to operate\n\nand determine the type of services it was licensed to provide.

Therefore, the next question is whether Guiding Light provided evidence to the trial\n\ncourt that it actually provided such treatment to T.L. See Shiloh, 510 S.W.3d at 39 (\u201cIn addition,\n\nthe record contains no evidence that Shiloh Treatment actually provided any medical care or\n\ntreatment to Ward or any other person.\u201d).\n\nB.     Did Guiding Light Provide Mental Health Treatment?\n\n       The Department\u2019s \u201cApplication for Placement of Children in Residential Care\u201d indicated\n\nT.L. had \u201cmental health needs requiring treatment.\u201d The application recommended \u201cspecialized\u201d\n\nlevel of care because T.L. had suicidal ideations/self-harming behaviors, had been diagnosed with\n\nADHD, Tourette\u2019s Disorder, and major depression \u201cepisode without psychosis.\u201d He also was\n\nalleged to have a history of assaultive behavior, including choking his two-year-old female sibling\n\nand killing animals. The application listed the immediate goals of placement as providing T.L.\n\nwith a safe environment, the basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. Long term goals included\n\nproviding him \u201cwith extensive therapy to address the underlying issues that led to the removal and\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nto provide the child with life techniques so that he can have an opportunity to become a productive\n\ncitizen.\u201d\n\n        As outlined, Guiding Light\u2019s admission assessment of T.L. listed his level of care as\n\n\u201cspecialized,\u201d and noted the same history as contained in the Department\u2019s application. The\n\nassessment noted: \u201c[T.L.] has mental health needs requiring treatment. [T.L.] is diagnosed with\n\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder of the Combined Presentation and Major depressive\n\ndisorder, Recurrent episode, Severe without psychosis. [T.L.] has no substance abuse history.\u201d\n\nThe assessment stated T.L. would \u201cbe examined by a physician while in placement at Guiding\n\nLight to determine medical needs\u201d and as follows:\n\n        V. OBJECTIVE OF PLACEMENT The objectives of this placement are to protect\n        [T.L.] from abuse and neglect and to provide [T.L.] with care that meets his needs\n        for permanency and belonging.\n\n        BASIC NEEDS [T.L.] has basic needs and requires food, shelter, and clothing; He\n        will also receive routine medical and dental care, a safe stimulating and nurturing\n        home environment that will include friendships and recreational activities.\n\n        Short-term Goals of Placement: The short-term goals of this placement are for\n        [T.L.] to receive regular medical and dental care, and be provided with a safe\n        environment. [T.L.] will be emotionally stable and demonstrate good social skills.\n        [T.L.] will attend school regularly and participate in social and recreational\n        activities.\n\n        Long-term Goals of Placement: [T.L.\u2019s] long term goal for placement is\n        independent living skills and to maintain overall good physical, dental and medical\n        health. [T.L.] will demonstrate behavioral control and maintain positive\n        relationships. [T.L.] will learn to verbalize his feelings appropriately. Also, [T.L.]\n        will successfully complete school and will demonstrate good social skills.\n\n        The assessment stated T.L. would \u201creceive anger management techniques, problems\n\nsolving skills, and learn to interact positively with peers to de-escalate negative behaviors.\u201d\n\nGuiding Light\u2019s staff would \u201cpositively redirect [T.L.\u2019s] behavior by being consistent with the\n\nfacility\u2019s rules and consequences, as well as promoting fair practices[; and p]rovide commands\n\nthat are brief, calm, and non-confrontational.\u201d The assessment also stated Guiding Light\u2019s\n\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\ntherapist would \u201cmaintain regular individual and group therapy sessions to address [T.L.\u2019s]\n\nbehavior, problems solving skills, positive interactions with peers, impulse control, and provide\n\nanger management techniques.\u201d\n\n       Guiding Light also provided a \u201c72-Hour Treatment Plan,\u201d which stated: \u201c[T.L.] will need\n\ncoping skills/techniques to help to manage his anger and obtain positive social skills, increase\n\nimpulse control as well as problem solving and decision-making techniques.\u201d The plan described\n\nT.L.\u2019s \u201ctreatment services\u201d as follows:\n\n           [T.L.] will receive individual therapy to work on his aggression, impulsivity,\n       depression and suicidal ideation. He will also need to understand how his actions\n       produce both negative and positive consequences from the caregivers. [T.L.] needs\n       to be involved in a structured recreational experience with peers in order to practice\n       positive social skills and develop friends. His therapy would also address [T.L.\u2019s]\n       cognitive/academic needs and/or deficits.\n\n                                              ...\n\n          [T.L.] will receive weekly individual and group therapy. He will also receive\n       appropriate psychological evaluations and monthly medication monitoring.\n\n       The plan listed the same responsibilities for its staff and therapists as listed on the\n\nadmission assessment. The \u201ctransitional living\u201d section of the plan stated\n\n           As a resident of Guiding Light Residential Treatment Center, [T.L.] will\n       participates [sic] in individual therapy, group therapy, and staff daily groups that\n       will teach him problem solving, stress management, assessing consequences,\n       establishing goals and planning for the future. While at Guiding Light he will be\n       required to complete weekly chores such as washing dishes, sweeping, mopping,\n       taking the trash out, cleaning windows and/or assisting with setting the table, this\n       will teach him everyday life skills. Once [T.L.] turns 16 y/o, his caseworker will\n       submit a referral to PAL classes and a referral for Circle Of Support.\n\n       An \u201cIndividual Therapeutic Services Report,\u201d completed by Guiding Light\u2019s Treatment\n\nDirector, Manuel Lozano Jr., who is a licensed professional counselor, stated\n\n          This therapist [Lozano] inquired about what [T.L.] feels he needs to focus on\n       while in treatment. [T.L.] reported that he feels he needs to focus on \u201cDepression\n       and Anger.\u201d This therapist explained to [T.L.] that he and this therapist would\n       explore his behaviors, recommendations from [the Department], and put together a\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n        treatment plan. This therapist reviewed the expectations of the facility and how to\n        successfully adjust to the facility. This therapist also reviewed the rules of the\n        facility. [T.L.] indicated that he understood and added that if he can\u2019t stay here\n        until he is 18 years old he will probably go to a foster home. Rapport was\n        established.\n                                              ...\n\n            [T.L.] is seen in individual therapy on a weekly basis for 45 minute sessions.\n        The sessions take place in the RTC. He also participates in 45-minute group session\n        on a weekly basis.\n\n        Finally, Guiding Light attached to its motion to dismiss the affidavits of Lozano and its\n\nExecutive Director, Phyllis Bartell. Lozano attested he held three individual therapy sessions with\n\nT.L. in September 2018 and created T.L.\u2019s treatment plan based on T.L.\u2019s medical history and\n\nindividual interview sessions. Lozano also stated that, in addition to his services, the medical team\n\nconsists of a psychiatrist, who is available via Telemed and sees each resident once every sixty\n\ndays or as needed, to assist in treating the psychiatric wellbeing of the residents. Bartell attested\n\nthat \u201c[p]sychiatric treatment through our psychiatrist consultant & his/her colleagues is available\n\n24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d\n\n        We conclude Guiding Light established it is a health care provider based on (1) its license\n\nto provide \u201ctreatment services\u201d for \u201cemotional disorders,\u201d (2) the Department\u2019s application for\n\nplacement that listed as a long term goal providing T.L. \u201cwith extensive therapy to address the\n\nunderlying issues that led to the removal and to provide the child with life techniques so that he\n\ncan have an opportunity to become a productive citizen,\u201d (3) its contract with the Department to\n\nprovide these services, and (4) the evidence that it did, in fact, provide these services to T.L.\n\nTherefore, we next examine whether Lopez\u2019s claim is based on facts implicating Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nconduct during T.L.\u2019s care and treatment. If it is, then we apply the rebuttable presumption that\n\nthe claim is a health care liability claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\f                                                                                        04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n                             HEALTH CARE LIABILITY CLAIM\n\n        One of the elements of a healthcare liability claim is that the claim or claims at issue must\n\nconcern treatment, lack of treatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical care, or\n\nhealth care, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health care.

On that date,\n       [T.L.] was fatally injured while living at a group home owned and operated by the\n       Defendant and located at 17602 Tucker Place, San Antonio, Texas 78221.\n       Specifically, and based on information and belief, [T.L.] and other young men at\n       the home were not adequately supervised, began to fight, and during the fight or\n       soon after, [T.L.] passed away. It is unclear at this time whether [T.L.] died at the\n       hands of another young man living at the home or at the hands of one of the\n       employees attempting to break up the fight. Either way, Guiding Light failed to\n       provide [T.L.] and its employees with adequate supervision, adequate training, or a\n       safe home environment.\n\n       Lopez alleged Guiding Light breached its duty of care by failing to (1) properly and\n\nadequately train and supervise its employees; (2) properly oversee and supervise the young men\n\nentrusted to it; and (3) exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to others.\n\nBecause we have already determined Lopez\u2019s claim satisfies the first element of a health care\n\n\n                                                 - 20 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nliability claim because Guiding Light is a health care provider, and Guiding Light did not dispute\n\nthat the third element of a health care liability claim (causation of the injury) was not satisfied,\n\nLopez may only rebut the presumption that his claim is a health care liability claim by proving his\n\nclaim does not constitute an alleged \u201cdeparture[ ] from accepted standards of medical care or health\n\ncare.\u201d See Bioderm, 426 S.W.3d at 759. Thus, we must determine whether Lopez\u2019s claims\n\nalleging Guiding Light failed to provide T.L. and its employees with adequate supervision,\n\nadequate training, or a safe home environment implicate one or more of the standards listed in the\n\nAct\u2019s definition of a healthcare liability claim.\n\n       \u201cWhen a plaintiff only alleges ordinary negligence against a health care provider, courts\n\nhave concluded the plaintiff did not assert a safety standard-based\u201d healthcare liability claim.

Unlike the allegations of ordinary negligence in these cases,\n\nLopez\u2019s allegations are not merely related to Guiding Light\u2019s duties as a premises owner or wholly\n\nunrelated to the rendition of health care. Guiding Light\u2019s alleged negligence is based on safety\n\nstandards uniquely arising from professional duties owed as a health care provider. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 340</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nWe conclude Lopez alleged departures from safety standards that implicate Guiding Light\u2019s duties\n\nas a health care provider; therefore, Lopez asserts a healthcare liability claim. Our conclusion is\n\nfurther supported by the Ross Court\u2019s non-exclusive list of considerations for analyzing whether a\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f                                                                                       04-20-00561-CV\n\n\nclaim is substantively related to a health care provider\u2019s provision of medical or health care and,\n\ntherefore, a healthcare liability claim.\n\n        Four of the Ross factors support our conclusion that Lopez asserts a safety standards-based\n\nhealthcare liability claim, two factors do not, and one does not apply because no instrumentality\n\nwas involved in the alleged negligence. As to the first and second factors, Lopez alleged Guiding\n\nLight failed to \u201cproperly oversee and supervise the young men entrusted to it\u201d while T.L. was\n\nliving at Guiding Light\u2019s facility. These allegations assert Guiding Light\u2019s alleged negligence\n\noccurred in the course of Guiding Light performing tasks with the purpose of protecting its\n\nresidents from harm in a place where residents might be during the time they were receiving care.\n\nTherefore, the first and second factors weigh in favor of finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a healthcare\n\nliability claim.\n\n        The third factor requires evidence that, at the time of the injury, T.L. was in the process of\n\nseeking or receiving health care. Guiding Light argued peer interaction and structured recreational\n\nexperiences with other residents was part of T.L.\u2019s treatment plan and, at the time of the incident,\n\nT.L. and other residents were in Guiding Light\u2019s living room area. On appeal, Guiding Light\n\nsuggests that \u201cwrestling with another resident in the living room area . . . certainly could be\n\nconsidered a recreational experience with peers of the type recommended by Lozano in T.L.\u2019s\n\ntreatment plan.\u201d Nothing in the record indicates any such recommendation was made and Guiding\n\nLight points to no other evidence that therapists or other healthcare workers were present during\n\nthe incident. Therefore, the third factor weighs against a finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a healthcare\n\nliability claim. The fourth factor also weighs against such a finding because there is no evidence\n\nGuiding Light was in the process of providing or assisting in providing health care when the\n\nincident occurred. The sixth factor does not apply because no instrumentality was involved in the\n\nalleged negligence.\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f                                                                                      04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       The fifth and seventh factors require evidence regarding whether the alleged negligence\n\n(1) is based on safety standards arising from professional duties owed by Guiding Light and (2)\n\noccurred in the course of Guiding Light\u2019s taking action or failing to take action necessary to\n\ncomply with safety-related requirements set for health care providers by governmental or\n\naccrediting agencies. The gravamen of Lopez\u2019s claim is Guiding Light failed to provide adequate\n\nsupervision of T.L. and provide for a safe home environment, and failed to adequately train its\n\nstaff. These allegations implicate both an alleged departure from the accepted standards of safety,\n\nand that T.L.\u2019s health care provider violated the standard of health care owed to Guiding Light\u2019s\n\nresidents. Thus, the fifth and seventh factors weigh in favor of a finding that Lopez\u2019s claim is a\n\nhealthcare liability claim.\n\n       Furthermore, expert testimony is necessary when the alleged negligence is of such a nature\n\nas not to be within the experience of laypersons. \u201c[I]n considering whether a claim alleges a\n\ndeparture from accepted standards of medical or health care, a court should first determine whether\n\nexpert medical or health care testimony is needed to establish the requisite standard of care and\n\nbreach.\u201d Bioderm, 426 S.W.3d at 760. \u201cAnd only if expert testimony is not needed should a court\n\nproceed to consider the totality of the circumstances, as a claim may still be a health care liability\n\nclaim despite that \u2018in the final analysis, expert testimony may not be necessary to support a\n\nverdict.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\n       How a health care provider trains its employees and the steps a provider such as Guiding\n\nLight must take to ensure a safe environment for its residents would likely fall outside a layperson\u2019s\n\ncommon knowledge. The range of alternatives available to a provider such as Guiding Light\n\nrequires medical judgment to select and implement. We, therefore, conclude an expert was\n\nrequired at least as to some of the allegations in Lopez\u2019s petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                                     04-20-00561-CV\n\n\n       While not all the Ross factors indicate Lopez asserts a safety standards-based healthcare\n\nliability claim, the factors that do weigh strongly in favor of our conclusion that expert testimony\n\nis required to prove or refute his claim.

In December, the department of human\n\nservices (DHS) began providing voluntary services to the mother and child after a\n\nchild-abuse      assessment     was   founded    due    to   the   mother\u2019s   ongoing\n\nmethamphetamine use while being the child\u2019s sole caregiver.\n\n          In December 2020, L.L. was formally removed from parental care,\n\nadjudicated a child in need of assistance (CINA), and placed with \u201cfictive kin.\u201d 3 The\n\nmother participated in mental-health and substance-abuse programing but\n\n\n1 Section 232.116(1)(g) allows the juvenile court to terminate parental rights if\n        the court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n               (1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of\n        assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n               (2) The court has terminated parental rights pursuant to\n        section 232.117 with respect to another child who is a member of the\n        same family . . . .\n               (3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parent\n        continues to lack the ability or willingness to respond to services\n        which would correct the situation.\n               (4) There is clear and convincing evidence that an additional\n        period of rehabilitation would not correct the situation.\n2 The court recently received a letter from the mother. We do not consider the\n\nletter because it is not part of the appellate record. See Iowa R. App. P. 6.801\n(defining the \u201crecord on appeal\u201d).\n3 The child was placed in the care of the purported father\u2019s cousin. Paternity testing\n\nlater determined he was not the biological father, but L.L. remains in that\nplacement. The rights of L.L.\u2019s biological father are not at issue here.\n\f                                         3\n\n\ncontinued to use and to test positive for methamphetamine. Just three weeks\n\nbefore the August 2, 2021 termination hearing, the mother entered into inpatient\n\ntreatment, where she tested positive for methamphetamine, heroine, and fentanyl.\n\nShe was transferred to a hospital for several days due to the severity of her\n\nwithdrawal symptoms before returning to the treatment program.\n\n       This is not the mother\u2019s first involvement with DHS and juvenile court. Her\n\nfirst founded child-abuse assessment was in March 2009; she was using\n\nmethamphetamine in the presence of her child and was also using other drugs.\n\nThe mother\u2019s rights to that child were terminated in December 2009. The mother\n\ngave birth to a second child in July 2015 whose umbilical cord tested positive for\n\nmethamphetamine and amphetamine, resulting in a second founded child-abuse\n\nassessment.    In September 2016 the mother was found to have been using\n\nmethamphetamine while caring for the child. Her parental rights to the child were\n\nterminated in August 2018 due to her inability to address her mental-health issues\n\nor achieve long-term sobriety and stability.4\n\n\n4The court in the 2018 termination ruling found grounds to terminate under Iowa\nCode section 232.116(1)(h) and (l) (2018). The court considered whether the\nmother\u2019s bond with the child provided a reason not terminate and stated:\n      Despite the mother having . . . made progress at times, the court\n      cannot find the child can be returned home when after the receipt of\n      a number of services, the mother is in no better position to care for\n      her child than when the initial removal occurred. The mother is not\n      in a place yet with her sobriety that this child\u2019s safety can be\n      guaranteed.\n              ....\n              Given this record and despite the abovementioned qualifying\n      exceptions, this court does not find that an exercise of its discretion\n      is warranted. Specifically, the mother\u2019s long substance abuse\n      history, coupled with her unwillingness or inability to adequately\n      address her substance abuse and mental health issues, after (1) a\n      prior termination of her parental rights; (2) a number of residential\n\f                                         4\n\n\n      Unfortunately, the mother continues to struggle with substance abuse and\n\nmental-health issues despite another year and a half of DHS services and\n\ninvolvement. A July 27, 2021 report from the mother\u2019s clinical therapist notes\n\ndiagnoses of stimulant use disorder and major depressive disorder and reports the\n\nmother was attending weekly therapy sessions. The therapist reports the mother\u2019s\n\ntherapy goals include \u201caddressing mental health symptoms that relate to her\n\nsubstance abuse, identifying healthy coping mechanisms, setting boundaries in\n\nher unhealthy relationships and taking appropriate steps to attain custody of her\n\ndaughter,\u201d all of which \u201care still in progress.\u201d The therapist recommended the\n\nmother complete her inpatient treatment program to \u201cbe better able to address\n\nmental health concerns.\u201d\n\n      The DHS social worker supervising the mother\u2019s case opined the child could\n\nnot be returned to the mother safely:\n\n      Due to her history, it\u2019s a high probability that she will\u2014she can only\n      maintain her sobriety if she\u2019s in a controlled environment. That\u2019s\n      what the history has shown, so once she leaves a controlled\n      environment, history has shown that she goes back to using drugs.\n      She\u2019s a\u2014she\u2019s a highly functioning addict. She is able to work and\n      hold a job, and for all intents and purposes, you know, she will\n      probably return to that lifestyle since she\u2019s been successful at it\n      before.\n\n\n\n\n      and outpatient treatments; (3) weekly court involvement and\n      oversight and accessibility of services provided by Recovery Court;\n      (4) length of time the child has been out of her care; (5) her continued\n      illegal substance use, most notably, a few weeks prior to the\n      termination hearing; (6) mother\u2019s denial and ability to camouflage\n      use; (7) age of the child; and (8) the child\u2019s need for permanency do\n      not lead this court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the\n      termination would be detrimental to the child due to the closeness of\n      the parent-child relationship.\n\f                                           5\n\n\n       The family support specialist who supervised visits testified she had no\n\nconcerns about the mother\u2019s care during visits and observed a close bond between\n\nparent and child. She was concerned, however, about the mother\u2019s ability to follow\n\nthrough with her treatment plan after the mother told her \u201cthat today if she does\n\nlose her rights, she is going to leave the treatment facility and get high.\u201d\n\n       The juvenile court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights\n\n       The mother does not contest grounds for termination exist pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode section 232.116(1)(g) (2021).5 However, she does contend termination is\n\nnot in the child\u2019s best interests and asserts \u201cher need to continue services for a\n\nlonger duration should not have been the determining factor in the termination of\n\nher parental rights, as she showed great willingness to change and sought out an\n\nin-patient facility that L.L. would be able to reside at with her.\u201d\n\n             Our review of termination of parental rights under Iowa Code\n       chapter 232 is a three-step analysis. First, we must determine\n       whether any ground for termination under section 232.116(1) has\n       been established. If so, we next determine whether the best-interest\n       framework as laid out in section 232.116(2) supports the termination\n       of parental rights. If we conclude section 232.116(2) supports\n       termination, we consider whether any exceptions in section\n       232.116(3) apply to preclude termination of parental rights.\n\nIn re A.B., 957 N.W.2d 280, 294 (Iowa 2021) (edited for readability). Here, the\n\nmother contests only the second step and, therefore, we limit our discussion to\n\nthat step. See In re P.L., 778 N.W.2d 33, 40 (Iowa 2010).\n\n\n5 The mother does contest termination under section 232.116(1)(e) (failing to\nmaintain significant and meaningful contact with the child during the previous six\nconsecutive months). Because we find clear and convincing evidence supports\ntermination under section 232.116(1)(g), we need not address the alternative\nground. In re T.S., 868 N.W.2d 425, 434 (Iowa Ct. App. 2015) (\u201cWhen the juvenile\ncourt orders termination of parental rights on more than one statutory ground, we\nneed only find grounds to terminate on one of the sections to affirm.\u201d).\n\f                                            6\n\n\n       The mother asserts there has been a \u201crush to terminate\u201d her parental rights.\n\nThe record shows otherwise.            DHS began working with the mother in\n\nDecember 2019.       Voluntary services were not sufficient, and the mother\u2019s\n\ncontinued drug use lead to a formal removal of the child from her custody in\n\nDecember 2020. Yet the mother testified her date of sobriety was July 12, 2021\u2014\n\nless than three weeks from the date of the termination hearing. This is eerily similar\n\nto the circumstances noted by the juvenile court in the 2018 termination ruling.\n\nSee In re M.S., 519 N.W.2d 398, 400 (Iowa 1994) (\u201cWe gain insight into the child\u2019s\n\nprospects by reviewing evidence of the parent\u2019s past performance\u2014for it may be\n\nindicative of the parent\u2019s future capabilities.\u201d).\n\n       In the instant case, the juvenile court wrote:\n\n       The mother testified that she previously did treatment while in prison\n       during her prior termination in 2009 or 2010, and that she did\n       inpatient treatment . . . in 2018 prior to her discharge for \u201cmaximum\n       benefits\u201d during that time. The mother believes that doing treatment\n       in [another town] and relocating to [another town] will lead to her\n       being successful at this attempt at treatment. The mother testified\n       her current treatment plan will be between [thirty] and [ninety] days.\n       The mother admits that methamphetamine was the main issue in her\n       2018 termination with [J.] and earlier in 2009 or 2010 with [M.]\n       Importantly, the mother was asked if she would trust someone to\n       babysit a [twenty-three]-month-old child if they had used\n       methamphetamine the night before and she answered \u201cno\u201d but was\n       unable to express why not. The clear answer is that it is a safety\n       concern.

In December, the department of human\n\nservices (DHS) began providing voluntary services to the mother and child after a\n\nchild-abuse      assessment     was   founded    due    to   the   mother\u2019s   ongoing\n\nmethamphetamine use while being the child\u2019s sole caregiver.\n\n          In December 2020, L.L. was formally removed from parental care,\n\nadjudicated a child in need of assistance (CINA), and placed with \u201cfictive kin.\u201d 3 The\n\nmother participated in mental-health and substance-abuse programing but\n\n\n1 Section 232.116(1)(g) allows the juvenile court to terminate parental rights if\n        the court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n               (1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of\n        assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n               (2) The court has terminated parental rights pursuant to\n        section 232.117 with respect to another child who is a member of the\n        same family . . . .\n               (3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parent\n        continues to lack the ability or willingness to respond to services\n        which would correct the situation.\n               (4) There is clear and convincing evidence that an additional\n        period of rehabilitation would not correct the situation.\n2 The court recently received a letter from the mother. We do not consider the\n\nletter because it is not part of the appellate record. See Iowa R. App. P. 6.801\n(defining the \u201crecord on appeal\u201d).\n3 The child was placed in the care of the purported father\u2019s cousin. Paternity testing\n\nlater determined he was not the biological father, but L.L. remains in that\nplacement. The rights of L.L.\u2019s biological father are not at issue here.\n\f                                         3\n\n\ncontinued to use and to test positive for methamphetamine. Just three weeks\n\nbefore the August 2, 2021 termination hearing, the mother entered into inpatient\n\ntreatment, where she tested positive for methamphetamine, heroine, and fentanyl.\n\nShe was transferred to a hospital for several days due to the severity of her\n\nwithdrawal symptoms before returning to the treatment program.\n\n       This is not the mother\u2019s first involvement with DHS and juvenile court. Her\n\nfirst founded child-abuse assessment was in March 2009; she was using\n\nmethamphetamine in the presence of her child and was also using other drugs.\n\nThe mother\u2019s rights to that child were terminated in December 2009. The mother\n\ngave birth to a second child in July 2015 whose umbilical cord tested positive for\n\nmethamphetamine and amphetamine, resulting in a second founded child-abuse\n\nassessment.    In September 2016 the mother was found to have been using\n\nmethamphetamine while caring for the child. Her parental rights to the child were\n\nterminated in August 2018 due to her inability to address her mental-health issues\n\nor achieve long-term sobriety and stability.4\n\n\n4The court in the 2018 termination ruling found grounds to terminate under Iowa\nCode section 232.116(1)(h) and (l) (2018). The court considered whether the\nmother\u2019s bond with the child provided a reason not terminate and stated:\n      Despite the mother having . . . made progress at times, the court\n      cannot find the child can be returned home when after the receipt of\n      a number of services, the mother is in no better position to care for\n      her child than when the initial removal occurred. The mother is not\n      in a place yet with her sobriety that this child\u2019s safety can be\n      guaranteed.\n              ....\n              Given this record and despite the abovementioned qualifying\n      exceptions, this court does not find that an exercise of its discretion\n      is warranted. Specifically, the mother\u2019s long substance abuse\n      history, coupled with her unwillingness or inability to adequately\n      address her substance abuse and mental health issues, after (1) a\n      prior termination of her parental rights; (2) a number of residential\n\f                                         4\n\n\n      Unfortunately, the mother continues to struggle with substance abuse and\n\nmental-health issues despite another year and a half of DHS services and\n\ninvolvement. A July 27, 2021 report from the mother\u2019s clinical therapist notes\n\ndiagnoses of stimulant use disorder and major depressive disorder and reports the\n\nmother was attending weekly therapy sessions. The therapist reports the mother\u2019s\n\ntherapy goals include \u201caddressing mental health symptoms that relate to her\n\nsubstance abuse, identifying healthy coping mechanisms, setting boundaries in\n\nher unhealthy relationships and taking appropriate steps to attain custody of her\n\ndaughter,\u201d all of which \u201care still in progress.\u201d The therapist recommended the\n\nmother complete her inpatient treatment program to \u201cbe better able to address\n\nmental health concerns.\u201d\n\n      The DHS social worker supervising the mother\u2019s case opined the child could\n\nnot be returned to the mother safely:\n\n      Due to her history, it\u2019s a high probability that she will\u2014she can only\n      maintain her sobriety if she\u2019s in a controlled environment. That\u2019s\n      what the history has shown, so once she leaves a controlled\n      environment, history has shown that she goes back to using drugs.\n      She\u2019s a\u2014she\u2019s a highly functioning addict. She is able to work and\n      hold a job, and for all intents and purposes, you know, she will\n      probably return to that lifestyle since she\u2019s been successful at it\n      before.\n\n\n\n\n      and outpatient treatments; (3) weekly court involvement and\n      oversight and accessibility of services provided by Recovery Court;\n      (4) length of time the child has been out of her care; (5) her continued\n      illegal substance use, most notably, a few weeks prior to the\n      termination hearing; (6) mother\u2019s denial and ability to camouflage\n      use; (7) age of the child; and (8) the child\u2019s need for permanency do\n      not lead this court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the\n      termination would be detrimental to the child due to the closeness of\n      the parent-child relationship.\n\f                                           5\n\n\n       The family support specialist who supervised visits testified she had no\n\nconcerns about the mother\u2019s care during visits and observed a close bond between\n\nparent and child. She was concerned, however, about the mother\u2019s ability to follow\n\nthrough with her treatment plan after the mother told her \u201cthat today if she does\n\nlose her rights, she is going to leave the treatment facility and get high.\u201d\n\n       The juvenile court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights\n\n       The mother does not contest grounds for termination exist pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode section 232.116(1)(g) (2021).5 However, she does contend termination is\n\nnot in the child\u2019s best interests and asserts \u201cher need to continue services for a\n\nlonger duration should not have been the determining factor in the termination of\n\nher parental rights, as she showed great willingness to change and sought out an\n\nin-patient facility that L.L. would be able to reside at with her.\u201d\n\n             Our review of termination of parental rights under Iowa Code\n       chapter 232 is a three-step analysis. First, we must determine\n       whether any ground for termination under section 232.116(1) has\n       been established. If so, we next determine whether the best-interest\n       framework as laid out in section 232.116(2) supports the termination\n       of parental rights. If we conclude section 232.116(2) supports\n       termination, we consider whether any exceptions in section\n       232.116(3) apply to preclude termination of parental rights.\n\nIn re A.B., 957 N.W.2d 280, 294 (Iowa 2021) (edited for readability). Here, the\n\nmother contests only the second step and, therefore, we limit our discussion to\n\nthat step. See In re P.L., 778 N.W.2d 33, 40 (Iowa 2010).\n\n\n5 The mother does contest termination under section 232.116(1)(e) (failing to\nmaintain significant and meaningful contact with the child during the previous six\nconsecutive months). Because we find clear and convincing evidence supports\ntermination under section 232.116(1)(g), we need not address the alternative\nground. In re T.S., 868 N.W.2d 425, 434 (Iowa Ct. App. 2015) (\u201cWhen the juvenile\ncourt orders termination of parental rights on more than one statutory ground, we\nneed only find grounds to terminate on one of the sections to affirm.\u201d).\n\f                                            6\n\n\n       The mother asserts there has been a \u201crush to terminate\u201d her parental rights.\n\nThe record shows otherwise.            DHS began working with the mother in\n\nDecember 2019.       Voluntary services were not sufficient, and the mother\u2019s\n\ncontinued drug use lead to a formal removal of the child from her custody in\n\nDecember 2020. Yet the mother testified her date of sobriety was July 12, 2021\u2014\n\nless than three weeks from the date of the termination hearing. This is eerily similar\n\nto the circumstances noted by the juvenile court in the 2018 termination ruling.\n\nSee In re M.S., 519 N.W.2d 398, 400 (Iowa 1994) (\u201cWe gain insight into the child\u2019s\n\nprospects by reviewing evidence of the parent\u2019s past performance\u2014for it may be\n\nindicative of the parent\u2019s future capabilities.\u201d).\n\n       In the instant case, the juvenile court wrote:\n\n       The mother testified that she previously did treatment while in prison\n       during her prior termination in 2009 or 2010, and that she did\n       inpatient treatment . . . in 2018 prior to her discharge for \u201cmaximum\n       benefits\u201d during that time.

In December, the department of human\n\nservices (DHS) began providing voluntary services to the mother and child after a\n\nchild-abuse      assessment     was   founded    due    to   the   mother\u2019s   ongoing\n\nmethamphetamine use while being the child\u2019s sole caregiver.\n\n          In December 2020, L.L. was formally removed from parental care,\n\nadjudicated a child in need of assistance (CINA), and placed with \u201cfictive kin.\u201d 3 The\n\nmother participated in mental-health and substance-abuse programing but\n\n\n1 Section 232.116(1)(g) allows the juvenile court to terminate parental rights if\n        the court finds that all of the following have occurred:\n               (1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of\n        assistance pursuant to section 232.96.\n               (2) The court has terminated parental rights pursuant to\n        section 232.117 with respect to another child who is a member of the\n        same family . . . .\n               (3) There is clear and convincing evidence that the parent\n        continues to lack the ability or willingness to respond to services\n        which would correct the situation.\n               (4) There is clear and convincing evidence that an additional\n        period of rehabilitation would not correct the situation.\n2 The court recently received a letter from the mother. We do not consider the\n\nletter because it is not part of the appellate record. See Iowa R. App. P. 6.801\n(defining the \u201crecord on appeal\u201d).\n3 The child was placed in the care of the purported father\u2019s cousin. Paternity testing\n\nlater determined he was not the biological father, but L.L. remains in that\nplacement. The rights of L.L.\u2019s biological father are not at issue here.\n\f                                         3\n\n\ncontinued to use and to test positive for methamphetamine. Just three weeks\n\nbefore the August 2, 2021 termination hearing, the mother entered into inpatient\n\ntreatment, where she tested positive for methamphetamine, heroine, and fentanyl.\n\nShe was transferred to a hospital for several days due to the severity of her\n\nwithdrawal symptoms before returning to the treatment program.\n\n       This is not the mother\u2019s first involvement with DHS and juvenile court. Her\n\nfirst founded child-abuse assessment was in March 2009; she was using\n\nmethamphetamine in the presence of her child and was also using other drugs.\n\nThe mother\u2019s rights to that child were terminated in December 2009. The mother\n\ngave birth to a second child in July 2015 whose umbilical cord tested positive for\n\nmethamphetamine and amphetamine, resulting in a second founded child-abuse\n\nassessment.    In September 2016 the mother was found to have been using\n\nmethamphetamine while caring for the child. Her parental rights to the child were\n\nterminated in August 2018 due to her inability to address her mental-health issues\n\nor achieve long-term sobriety and stability.4\n\n\n4The court in the 2018 termination ruling found grounds to terminate under Iowa\nCode section 232.116(1)(h) and (l) (2018). The court considered whether the\nmother\u2019s bond with the child provided a reason not terminate and stated:\n      Despite the mother having . . . made progress at times, the court\n      cannot find the child can be returned home when after the receipt of\n      a number of services, the mother is in no better position to care for\n      her child than when the initial removal occurred. The mother is not\n      in a place yet with her sobriety that this child\u2019s safety can be\n      guaranteed.\n              ....\n              Given this record and despite the abovementioned qualifying\n      exceptions, this court does not find that an exercise of its discretion\n      is warranted. Specifically, the mother\u2019s long substance abuse\n      history, coupled with her unwillingness or inability to adequately\n      address her substance abuse and mental health issues, after (1) a\n      prior termination of her parental rights; (2) a number of residential\n\f                                         4\n\n\n      Unfortunately, the mother continues to struggle with substance abuse and\n\nmental-health issues despite another year and a half of DHS services and\n\ninvolvement. A July 27, 2021 report from the mother\u2019s clinical therapist notes\n\ndiagnoses of stimulant use disorder and major depressive disorder and reports the\n\nmother was attending weekly therapy sessions. The therapist reports the mother\u2019s\n\ntherapy goals include \u201caddressing mental health symptoms that relate to her\n\nsubstance abuse, identifying healthy coping mechanisms, setting boundaries in\n\nher unhealthy relationships and taking appropriate steps to attain custody of her\n\ndaughter,\u201d all of which \u201care still in progress.\u201d The therapist recommended the\n\nmother complete her inpatient treatment program to \u201cbe better able to address\n\nmental health concerns.\u201d\n\n      The DHS social worker supervising the mother\u2019s case opined the child could\n\nnot be returned to the mother safely:\n\n      Due to her history, it\u2019s a high probability that she will\u2014she can only\n      maintain her sobriety if she\u2019s in a controlled environment. That\u2019s\n      what the history has shown, so once she leaves a controlled\n      environment, history has shown that she goes back to using drugs.\n      She\u2019s a\u2014she\u2019s a highly functioning addict. She is able to work and\n      hold a job, and for all intents and purposes, you know, she will\n      probably return to that lifestyle since she\u2019s been successful at it\n      before.\n\n\n\n\n      and outpatient treatments; (3) weekly court involvement and\n      oversight and accessibility of services provided by Recovery Court;\n      (4) length of time the child has been out of her care; (5) her continued\n      illegal substance use, most notably, a few weeks prior to the\n      termination hearing; (6) mother\u2019s denial and ability to camouflage\n      use; (7) age of the child; and (8) the child\u2019s need for permanency do\n      not lead this court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the\n      termination would be detrimental to the child due to the closeness of\n      the parent-child relationship.\n\f                                           5\n\n\n       The family support specialist who supervised visits testified she had no\n\nconcerns about the mother\u2019s care during visits and observed a close bond between\n\nparent and child. She was concerned, however, about the mother\u2019s ability to follow\n\nthrough with her treatment plan after the mother told her \u201cthat today if she does\n\nlose her rights, she is going to leave the treatment facility and get high.\u201d\n\n       The juvenile court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights\n\n       The mother does not contest grounds for termination exist pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode section 232.116(1)(g) (2021).5 However, she does contend termination is\n\nnot in the child\u2019s best interests and asserts \u201cher need to continue services for a\n\nlonger duration should not have been the determining factor in the termination of\n\nher parental rights, as she showed great willingness to change and sought out an\n\nin-patient facility that L.L. would be able to reside at with her.\u201d\n\n             Our review of termination of parental rights under Iowa Code\n       chapter 232 is a three-step analysis. First, we must determine\n       whether any ground for termination under section 232.116(1) has\n       been established. If so, we next determine whether the best-interest\n       framework as laid out in section 232.116(2) supports the termination\n       of parental rights. If we conclude section 232.116(2) supports\n       termination, we consider whether any exceptions in section\n       232.116(3) apply to preclude termination of parental rights.\n\nIn re A.B., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">957 N.W.2d 280</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (Iowa 2021) (edited for readability).

Because we find clear and convincing evidence supports\ntermination under section 232.116(1)(g), we need not address the alternative\nground.

DHS began working with the mother in\n\nDecember 2019.       Voluntary services were not sufficient, and the mother\u2019s\n\ncontinued drug use lead to a formal removal of the child from her custody in\n\nDecember 2020. Yet the mother testified her date of sobriety was July 12, 2021\u2014\n\nless than three weeks from the date of the termination hearing. This is eerily similar\n\nto the circumstances noted by the juvenile court in the 2018 termination ruling.\n\nSee In re M.S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1668478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1668478/in-interest-of-ms/\">519 N.W.2d 398</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 400 (Iowa 1994) (\u201cWe gain insight into the child\u2019s\n\nprospects by reviewing evidence of the parent\u2019s past performance\u2014for it may be\n\nindicative of the parent\u2019s future capabilities.\u201d).\n\n       In the instant case, the juvenile court wrote:\n\n       The mother testified that she previously did treatment while in prison\n       during her prior termination in 2009 or 2010, and that she did\n       inpatient treatment . . . in 2018 prior to her discharge for \u201cmaximum\n       benefits\u201d during that time.

Statutory and Regulatory Framework for Disability Retirement\n\n       The Secretary of each branch of the armed services possesses the authority to retire a\n\nservice member with retired pay if the Secretary determines the service member is \u201cunfit to\n\nperform the duties of the member\u2019s office, grade, rank or rating because of physical disability\n\nincurred while entitled to basic pay.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a). 1 To be eligible for disability retirement,\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Plaintiff correctly identifies 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 as the money-mandating statute supporting\nthe Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this matter. Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 1; see Fisher v. United States,\n402 F.3d 1167, 1175 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Sawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1580 (Fed.\nCir. 1991)).\n\fthe service member\u2019s disability must be of a permanent nature and not the product of the member\u2019s\n\nown misconduct or neglect. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1201(b)(1), (b)(2). Additionally, disability retirement is\n\navailable only to members who have either 20 years of service or whose disability is at least 30\n\npercent under the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Schedule for Ratings Disabilities and\n\nwas incurred in, among other circumstances, the line of duty. Id. \u00a7 1201(b)(3). Congress has\n\nauthorized the Secretary concerned to prescribe regulations implementing the statutory provisions\n\ngoverning retirement or separation due to physical disability. Id. \u00a7 1216(a).\n\n        The relevant regulation in Plaintiff\u2019s case is Secretary of the Navy Instruction\n\n(\u201cSECNAVINST\u201d) 1850.4E, which defined the applicable standards and procedures used by the\n\nNavy to adjudicate disability cases at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation. Pursuant to the instruction,\n\na Physical Evaluation Board (\u201cPEB\u201d) acts on behalf of the Secretary of the Navy to determine a\n\nmember\u2019s fitness to continue naval service and entitlement to disability benefits. See Department\n\nof Navy (DON) Disability Evaluation Manual, SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (1), \u00b6 1004.a (Apr.\n\n30, 2002) (describing PEB procedures as part of the Navy\u2019s Disability Evaluation System\n\n(\u201cDES\u201d)).      In assessing whether a service member is eligible for disability retirement,\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E provides that:\n\n        The sole standard to be used in making determinations of physical disability as a\n        basis for retirement or separation is unfitness to perform the duties of office, grade,\n        rank or rating because of disease or injury incurred or aggravated while entitled to\n        basic pay. Each case is considered by relating the nature and degree of physical\n        disability of the member to requirements and duties that member may reasonably\n        be expected to perform in his or her office, grade, rank or rating.\n\nId., encl. (3), \u00b6 3301. 2\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           The instruction similarly defines unfitness as an inability to \u201creasonably perform the\nduties of office, grade, rank or rating.\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (2), \u00b6 2085.\n                                                  2\n\f       The instruction provides four considerations for the PEB to assess in determining whether\n\na service member can reasonably perform his or her duties: (1) common military tasks, i.e.,\n\nwhether the member is unable to reasonably perform routine assignments expected of his or her\n\noffice, grade, rank or rating; (2) physical readiness/fitness tests, i.e., whether the member\u2019s\n\ncondition prohibits him or her from taking all or part of physical readiness/fitness tests; (3)\n\ndeployability, i.e., whether the member\u2019s condition prevents him or her from being positioned\n\noutside the continental United States for an unspecified amount of time; and (4) special\n\nqualifications, i.e., whether the member\u2019s condition causes the loss of any specialized\n\nqualifications. Id. \u00b6 3304. Notably, the standards utilized for a disability determination and for\n\nconsidering common military tasks are effectively interchangeable: both assess whether the\n\nmember can reasonably perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating. See id.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 3301, 3302.a, 3304.a.(1). Therefore, a finding that a service member cannot perform his or her\n\ncommon military tasks is dispositive to the ultimate question of the member\u2019s unfitness. By\n\ncontrast, the considerations of deployability, physical fitness test, and special qualifications cannot\n\nbe used individually as the sole basis for a finding of unfitness. See id. \u00b6 3307.\n\n       In addition to the four considerations, the instruction also provides that the PEB may\n\nevaluate other general criteria when determining a member\u2019s unfitness, including, as relevant here,\n\nwhether a member\u2019s condition poses a medical risk to the member (or other members) were the\n\nmember to be retained on active duty and whether the condition imposes unreasonable\n\nrequirements on the military to maintain or protect the member. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3302.b.(1), (2).\n\n       \u201c[I]n assessing service member fitness, including the circumstances of referral [to the\n\nDES],\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E instructs the PEB to \u201c[c]onsider all relevant evidence,\u201d id. \u00b6 3303,\n\nand make a finding of fitness or unfitness based on a preponderance of the evidence, id. \u00b6 3306.b.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fThe instruction recognizes that in certain circumstances performance evaluations \u201cmay provide\n\nbetter evidence than a clinical estimate by a physician of the service member\u2019s ability to perform\n\nhis or her duties.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3303.b; see id. \u00b6 3205. It also provides that a member can be determined\n\nfit based on a finding that he or she adequately performed duties until the time of referral for DES\n\nprocessing, even if medical evidence calls into question his or her physical ability to continue to\n\nperform those duties. Id. \u00b6 3303.c.\n\n       Notably, SECNAVINST 1850.4E does not apply to a member who is pending\n\nadministrative discharge for misconduct. See id., encl. (1), \u00b6 1002.b. According to the instruction,\n\n\u201cprocessing for administrative discharge for misconduct takes precedence over processing for\n\ndisability.\u201d Id.\n\n       Although Plaintiff was never referred to the PEB for evaluation before the Navy discharged\n\nhim, the standard and related considerations established in SECNAVINST 1850.4E, as discussed\n\nabove, guide the Court in evaluating the propriety of the BCNR\u2019s decision-making process. See\n\nSawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (recognizing the BCNR \u201cis\n\ncompetent to make a disability determination in the first instance\u201d); Beckham v. United States, 392\n\nF.2d 619, 622 (Ct. Cl. 1968) (recognizing the BCNR, \u201clike other administrative bodies, is bound\n\nby its own regulations\u201d).\n\nB.     Findings of Fact\n\n       Plaintiff enlisted in the United States Navy and entered active duty on November 12, 2008.\n\nAdmin. R. 146, 153, ECF No. 8 (\u201cAR\u201d). Within a year of enlisting, Plaintiff graduated from diving\n\nschool and qualified as a Second Class Navy Diver. Id. at 401\u201302. Plaintiff was then assigned to\n\nMobile Diving and Salvage Company Two where he performed numerous dives as part of salvage\n\noperations and joint naval exercises from at least January 2009 until October 2012. Id. at 160\u201366.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fA performance evaluation report from this period characterizes Plaintiff as a \u201cdevoted and tireless\n\nperformer,\u201d reflecting the integral and admired nature of his skills as a diver. See id. at 165; see\n\nalso id. at 163 (describing Plaintiff as an \u201ceffective team member with job accomplishment as a\n\ntop priority\u201d); id. at 161 (praising, among other qualities, Plaintiff\u2019s diving and management\n\nskills). In March 2010, Plaintiff earned the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal and the\n\nHumanitarian Service Medal for the superior performance of his duties during a deployment to\n\nHaiti where he cleared and assisted in the re-opening of critical commercial seaports damaged\n\nduring the earthquake that occurred there earlier that year. Id. at 167, 400.\n\n       After his deployment to Haiti, Plaintiff was deployed to the Persian Gulf in September\n\n2010 where he conducted 41 anti-terrorism force protection dives and served as lead diver for three\n\nother dives. Id. at 165. In July 2012, he participated in a mission to Canada where his efforts\n\nproved \u201cvital\u201d in a diving operation, in which he successfully excavated, recovered, and repatriated\n\nthree U.S. Army Air Corps personnel lost since 1942 in 120 feet of water off the coast of Nova\n\nScotia. Id. at 39, 161.\n\n       Diving is a hazardous occupation in the Navy and, unfortunately, Plaintiff suffered two\n\ndiving-related medical events during his military service. In 2010, he experienced a head trauma\n\nas a result of striking his head during a dive. 3 Id. at 8, 39, 77. Additionally, during a dive in\n\nsupport of the mission to Nova Scotia, Plaintiff suffered from hypoxia and type 2 decompression\n\nsickness. Id. at 39, 78. In relation to the latter event, crew members pulled Plaintiff out of the\n\nwater after he lost consciousness, and a doctor examined him before he returned to service later\n\nthat same day. Id. at 39. Following this event of hypoxia, Plaintiff reportedly began experiencing\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Plaintiff also experienced a second head injury in 2012 when he hit his head on the\nground while playing recreational football. AR 8, 39, 78.\n                                                 5\n\femotional and behavioral changes and consuming alcohol excessively. Id. at 39, 78. It was during\n\nthis time in 2012 that Plaintiff also separated from his wife. Id. at 39.\n\n       In October 2012, the Navy transferred Plaintiff to the United States Naval Academy in\n\nAnnapolis, Maryland. Id. at 158. Within months, Plaintiff\u2019s conduct began to suffer. In January\n\n2013, he was counseled for an unauthorized absence from a command physical fitness session and\n\nsubstandard appearance during a command indoctrination course. Id. at 417. Plaintiff received\n\nfurther counseling in March 2013 after being cited by local law enforcement for reckless driving\n\nafter he was stopped for speeding in a government-issued vehicle. Id. at 418. Then, on April 14,\n\n2013, Plaintiff was cited by the Annapolis Police Department for, among other charges, driving a\n\nvehicle while impaired by alcohol (\u201cDWI\u201d). Id. at 420. Plaintiff\u2019s medical records show that,\n\nduring this period of frequent misconduct, he received some outpatient mental health treatment.\n\nA February 2013 mental health record notes diagnoses of adjustment disorder with anxiety and\n\ndepressed mood, as well as marital problems. Id. at 219.\n\n       As a result of the DWI citation, the Navy issued Plaintiff a non-judicial punishment\n\n(\u201cNJP\u201d), which included, inter alia, forfeiture of pay, reduction in pay rate, and community\n\nservice. Id. at 157, 422. The aspects of the NJP related to Plaintiff\u2019s pay were suspended for six\n\nmonths. Id. at 422. Because of the NJP, the Navy conducted a performance evaluation of Plaintiff,\n\ncovering the period of March 16, 2013, to May 13, 2013. Id. at 156\u201357. This evaluation described\n\nPlaintiff as \u201can above average Sailor who made a serious mistake\u201d from which he could recover\n\nwith mentoring and strong personal desire. Id. at 157. It reflected that Plaintiff at that time\n\nadequately performed the duties of a Second Class Navy Diver, which included the operation,\n\nmaintenance, and repair of diving equipment, and collateral duties including the performance of\n\nfuneral honors. Id. at 156. Plaintiff was rated as meeting standards in all categories, except for\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f\u201cmilitary bearing/character.\u201d Id. at 156\u201357. After issuing the NJP, it appears the Navy also\n\nsuspended Plaintiff\u2019s diving qualifications due, in part, to \u201cpersonal issues\u201d identified as \u201cfamily\n\nseparation\u201d and Plaintiff\u2019s receipt of the March 2013 speeding ticket while driving in a government\n\nvehicle. Id. at 435 (noting that Plaintiff was \u201con a suspend bust from the former Commandant this\n\nspring\u201d).\n\n       Finally, on July 21, 2013, the Annapolis Police Department arrested Plaintiff for theft,\n\ndisorderly conduct, and resisting arrest after he left a restaurant without paying his bill. Id. at 426.\n\nThe arresting officer observed that Plaintiff\u2019s eyes were watery and glassy, his speech slurred, and\n\nhis breath emitted a strong odor of alcohol. Id. On July 30, 2013, Plaintiff received notice that\n\nthe Navy was processing him for administrative separation due to misconduct, specifically the\n\ncommission of a serious offense. Id. at 149\u201350. The Navy additionally vacated the suspension of\n\nthe forfeiture of pay and reduction in pay rate aspects of his earlier NJP. Id. at 433. It also removed\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s Second Class Diver classification on September 24, 2013. Id. at 155.\n\n       Between August and December 2013, Plaintiff was temporarily assigned to Fort Belvoir\n\nCommunity Hospital in Virginia where he successfully graduated from a military in-patient\n\nrehabilitation program and an outpatient dual-diagnoses therapy program where he was treated for\n\ndepression and alcohol use disorder. Id. at 67, 113, 154. During his time at Fort Belvoir\n\nCommunity Hospital, Plaintiff underwent neuropsychological testing to evaluate whether he\n\nsuffered from a traumatic brain injury (\u201cTBI\u201d). Id. at 35. According to the December 9, 2013\n\nreport of the Defense Health Agency (\u201cDHA\u201d), the evaluation concluded that Plaintiff had\n\nneurocognitive deficits that required \u201congoing and persistent treatment.\u201d Id. These deficits\n\nincluded \u201ccircumscribed cognitive difficulties on tasks requiring mental processing speed, slowed\n\nfine motor and dexterity and visuospatial processing, complex problem solving[,] and memory.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fId. The DHA report concluded that some of Plaintiff\u2019s cognitive difficulties were attributable to\n\nmultiple etiologies including childhood maltreatment, fetal alcohol exposure, and hypoxia\n\nepisodes from multiple long-term dives and reduced oxygen saturation. Id. It also noted Plaintiff\u2019s\n\n\u201crepeated symptom of \u2018odd\u2019 sensory feelings and reduced motor functioning from dives,\u201d as well\n\nas evidence of a small cyst in his brain complicating his sensory and motor functioning. Id. at 36.\n\nPlaintiff was ultimately diagnosed with major depressive disorder, cognitive disorder, antisocial\n\ntraits, potential hypoxia, and retrocerebellar cyst. Id.\n\n       On December 6, 2013, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy issued a decision to\n\ndischarge Plaintiff due to his misconduct. Id. at 145. Plaintiff\u2019s separation caused a final\n\nperformance evaluation to be conducted, covering the period of May 14, 2013, to December 20,\n\n2013. Id. at 154\u201355. The evaluation report noted Plaintiff was performing the duties of a\n\nmaintenance technician during this period, and his performance was evaluated as \u201cmeeting\n\nstandards\u201d for all categories of performance traits except for the trait of \u201cmilitary\n\nbearing/character.\u201d Id. Plaintiff also underwent a pre-separation medical assessment, which noted\n\nthat \u201cTBI, depression and anxiety disorder affect[ed] [Plaintiff\u2019s] capacity to continue diving.\u201d Id.\n\nat 452; see id. at 453 (listing diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and\n\n\u201cneurological [and] cognitive impairment\u201d). Nonetheless, the assessment found Plaintiff qualified\n\nfor service and separation. Id. at 453.\n\n       Although his command had become aware of Plaintiff\u2019s TBI evaluation and neurocognitive\n\ndeficits during the separation process, id. at 436\u201337, Plaintiff was officially discharged from the\n\nNavy for misconduct on December 20, 2013, with his rate reflecting \u201cND3\u201d or Third Class Navy\n\nDiver, and the character of his service noted as \u201cunder honorable conditions (general),\u201d id. at 399.\n\nSee also id. at 146\u201348.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fC.     Procedural Background\n\n       1.      Decision of the Naval Discharge Review Board (\u201cNDRB\u201d)\n\n       On February 3, 2015, Plaintiff sought a change in his characterization of and narrative\n\nreason for discharge from the NDRB on equity and propriety grounds.                Id. at 370, 372.\n\nSpecifically, Plaintiff requested a discharge upgrade from a general to honorable characterization\n\nand an alteration to the statements of narrative reason and separation authority included on his\n\ndischarge document. Id. at 372.\n\n       After providing an in-person hearing, the NDRB rendered its final decision on October 14,\n\n2015, granting Plaintiff\u2019s request for relief. Id. at 134. The NDRB considered each of the issues\n\nraised by Plaintiff, rejecting all his arguments alleging that the Navy committed some type of legal\n\nerror preceding and/or during the separation process. Id. at 135\u201338. It specifically found that\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s July 2013 arrest was the result of \u201cconscious decisions that violate[d] the tenants of\n\nhonorable and faithful service.\u201d Id. at 138.\n\n       The NDRB, however, determined that relief was warranted \u201cbased on equitable grounds\n\ndue to [Plaintiff\u2019s] service connected cognitive defects.\u201d Id. (finding the \u201crecord of evidence\n\nclearly show[ed] [Plaintiff] was engaged in hazardous service that resulted in a definite,\n\ndocumented, causal relationship between his hazardous service and his resulting disabilities\u201d).\n\nThe NDRB acknowledged that, although Plaintiff \u201cincurred his disabilities from his hazardous\n\nservice,\u201d that was \u201cnot sufficient by itself to support an upgrade determination.\u201d Id. Rather, the\n\nNDRB based its decision on the \u201ctotality of [Plaintiff\u2019s] service record, the start date of his mental\n\nhealth counseling and evaluation, the manifestation dates of his misconduct, and his post-service\n\nactions and treatment records with respect to the equity of his discharge characterization and\n\nnarrative reason for separation.\u201d Id. Notably, the NDRB \u201cfound [Plaintiff\u2019s] discharge was proper\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fand equitable at the time of discharge.\u201d Id. at 139. It based its upgrade determination \u201con matters\n\nof equity related to [Plaintiff\u2019s] post-service diagnoses of medical conditions related to his\n\nhazardous duty diving operations.\u201d Id. at 139. On that ground alone, the NDRB directed that\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s discharge be changed to \u201chonorable\u201d and the narrative reason be changed to \u201csecretarial\n\nauthority.\u201d Id.\n\n       2.         Decision of the BCNR\n\n       On December 20, 2016, over a year after the NDRB upgraded his discharge, Plaintiff\n\nsubmitted an application to the BCNR requesting the Board correct his military records to reflect\n\na disability retirement. Id. at 10. Plaintiff asserted that the NDRB\u2019s decision to upgrade his\n\ncharacterization to a fully honorable discharge, in addition to his VA disability rating, entitled him\n\nto an award of 60 percent military medical retirement pay. 4 Id.\n\n       On July 19, 2017, the Chairman of the BCNR requested comments and recommendations\n\non Plaintiff\u2019s claim from the Director of the Navy\u2019s Council of Review Boards (\u201cCORB\u201d). Id. at\n\n125. In response, an advisor of the Senior Medical Officer of CORB issued an advisory opinion\n\nconcluding that his review of the available evidence did not support Plaintiff\u2019s request for\n\ndisability retirement. Id. at 127. In sum, the advisor stated that \u201cobjective evidence\u201d established\n\nPlaintiff performed his duties adequately at the time of his separation. Id. at 130. He further noted\n\nthat Plaintiff\u2019s \u201clargely alcohol-related misconduct . . . appears to have led to his discharge,\u201d and\n\nthe misconduct did not \u201cresult[] from a legally exculpating level of psychological impairment\n\nincident to a potentially compensable psychiatric condition.\u201d Id. Finally, the advisor observed\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          In September 2014, the VA issued Plaintiff a combined disability rating of 60 percent\nresulting from his medical impairments, which included tinnitus, major depressive disorder,\ncognitive deficits, and motor slowing due to decompression sickness and hypoxic episodes. AR\n462\u201366.\n                                                 10\n\fthat, per his review of the record, none of \u201cthe involved health care evaluators and providers of\n\nrecord contemporary with [Plaintiff\u2019s] active service felt him to be unfit or that referral to the . . .\n\nPEB was warranted.\u201d Id. Had such a referral occurred, the advisor opined that \u201ca finding of fit to\n\ncontinue naval service would have been the likely result.\u201d Id. at 131. On October 31, 2017, the\n\nDirector of CORB concurred with the recommendation of the Senior Medical Advisor. Id. at 132.\n\n        In a letter dated December 12, 2017, serving as a rebuttal to the CORB advisory opinion,\n\nPlaintiff\u2014through counsel\u2014argued that he \u201csuffered from significant cognitive and emotional\n\nimpairment as well as untreated PTSD at the time of separation\u201d and that a \u201cpreponderance of the\n\nevidence suggest[ed] that these medical impairments directly relate[d] back to [Plaintiff\u2019s] in-\n\nservice injuries and existed in 2013.\u201d Id. at 13. Plaintiff disagreed with several of the Senior\n\nMedical Advisor\u2019s assertions, including that: Plaintiff\u2019s alcohol-related misconduct that resulted\n\nin his separation did not result from a \u201clegally exculpating level of psychological impairment\n\nincident to a potentially compensable psychiatric condition,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s impairments did not\n\nwarrant a referral to the PEB, or a referral would have resulted in a finding of Plaintiff being fit\n\nfor continued naval service. Id. at 13\u201317. Plaintiff argued that SECNAVINST 1850.4E required\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s referral to the PEB instead of being administratively separated. See id. at 17 (citing\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\u00b6 3106, 3202.g). 5 Plaintiff offered no additional or alternative\n\nbases to argue that his disabilities should have prevented his separation or taken precedence over\n\nhis separation due to misconduct. See id.\n\n        The BCNR denied Plaintiff\u2019s application on February 5, 2018, finding no error or injustice\n\nwarranted correction to Plaintiff\u2019s record. Id. at 5\u20136. The Board also rejected Plaintiff\u2019s request\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          Plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal letter cites \u00b6 3202.b of SECNAVINST 1850.4E; however, the\nlanguage quoted in the letter appears in \u00b6 3202.g. See AR 17.\n                                                  11\n\fto personally appear before it and considered Plaintiff\u2019s case based on the record. Id. at 6\u20137. The\n\nBoard \u201csubstantially concurred\u201d with the CORB advisory opinion and found that objective\n\nevidence, i.e., Plaintiff\u2019s last two performance evaluations from 2013, showed that Plaintiff\n\nadequately performed the duties of his office, grade, rank, or rating, despite his diagnosed\n\ndisabilities. Id. at 6. The Board also concurred with the NDRB\u2019s finding that the Navy properly\n\nprocessed and discharged Plaintiff for misconduct. Id. Like the NDRB, the Board found no\n\nevidence demonstrating that Plaintiff was not criminally responsible for his misconduct, such as\n\nany evidence indicating mental incompetence. Id. Because of this, even assuming the record\n\nsupported a finding of unfitness, the Board concluded that Plaintiff\u2019s misconduct separation\n\nprocessing took precedence over any right to be referred to the DES. Id.\n\n       3.      The Instant Action\n\n       Plaintiff filed suit in this Court on May 8, 2020. Pl.\u2019s Compl., ECF No. 1. In accordance\n\nwith the Court\u2019s scheduling order, see ECF No. 7, Defendant filed the Administrative Record on\n\nAugust 14, 2020, see ECF No. 8. On September 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Judgment\n\non the Administrative Record, arguing that the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny him placement on the\n\ndisability retirement list was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and/or unsupported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. See Pl.\u2019s Mot. for J. on Admin. R., ECF No. 9; Pl.\u2019s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nJ. on Admin. R., ECF No. 10; Pl.\u2019s App., ECF No. 10-1. According to Plaintiff, the Board failed\n\nto properly apply and adhere to relevant naval disability retirement regulations, under which he\n\nshould have been found unfit at the time of his separation, and naval policies issued after his\n\nseparation that support the prioritization of disability retirement over separation based on\n\nmisconduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f       Defendant subsequently cross-moved for judgment on the administrative record, asserting\n\nthat the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny Plaintiff\u2019s request for disability retirement was rational and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. See Def.\u2019s Cross Mot. for J. on Admin. R., ECF No. 11.\n\nAccording to Defendant, the Board reasonably determined that (1) Plaintiff was able to perform\n\nhis duties at the time of his separation despite his medical conditions, and (2) his misconduct\n\nproceedings took precedence over his disability processing.\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       Pursuant to RCFC 52.1, judgment on the administrative record is \u201cproperly understood as\n\n. . . an expedited trial on the record.\u201d Bannum, Inc. v. United States, 404 F.3d 1346, 1356 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2005). In contrast to the standard for summary judgment, \u201cthe standard for judgment on the\n\nadministrative record is narrower\u201d and involves determining, \u201cgiven all the disputed and\n\nundisputed facts in the administrative record, whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof to\n\nshow that the [challenged] decision was not in accordance with the law.\u201d Martinez v. United\n\nStates, 77 Fed. Cl. 318, 324 (2007) (citing Bannum, 404 F.3d at 1357). Therefore, a genuine issue\n\nof disputed fact does not prevent a court from granting a motion for judgment on the administrative\n\nrecord. See Bannum, 404 F.3d at 1357.\n\n       For military pay cases, a court will not disturb a decision rendered by a military correction\n\nboard unless the decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or unsupported by substantial\n\nevidence.\u201d See Barnes v. United States, 473 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A decision is\n\narbitrary and capricious when the agency decision-maker, such as the BCNR, \u201centirely failed to\n\nconsider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs\n\ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fdifference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm\n\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); see Metz v. United States, 466 F.3d 991, 998 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2006) (\u201c[W]hen a service member does pursue . . . relief [from a military correction board],\n\nthe Court of Federal Claims reviews the Board\u2019s action under the same [Administrative Procedure\n\nAct (\u201cAPA\u201d)] standard as any other agency action.\u201d (citing Martinez v. United States, 333 F.3d\n\n1295, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2003))). Applying the APA standard of review does not require \u201ca\n\nreweighing of the evidence, but [simply] a determination whether the conclusion being reviewed\n\nis supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Heisig v. United States, 719 F.2d 1153, 1157 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1983). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something less than the weight of the evidence but more than a\n\nmere scintilla of evidence.\u201d In re NuVasive, Inc., 842 F.3d 1376, 1379\u201380 (Fed. Cir. 2016)\n\n(quoting In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). If a reasonable mind would accept\n\nthe evidence as adequate to support a conclusion, the evidence is substantial. See Consol. Edison\n\nCo. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).\n\n       Given this standard, the Court\u2019s review of a military correction board\u2019s decision-making\n\nprocess is \u201cnecessarily limit[ed] . . . to the administrative record.\u201d Metz, 466 F.3d at 998. The\n\nplaintiff has the burden to prove the board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious through \u201ccogent\n\nand clearly convincing evidence,\u201d Wronke v. Marsh, 787 F.2d 1569, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and\n\n\u201cmust overcome the strong, but rebuttable, presumption that the administrators of the military, like\n\nother public officers, discharge their duties correctly, lawfully, and in good faith,\u201d Porter v. United\n\nStates, 163 F.3d 1304, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting Sanders v. United States, 594 F.2d 804, 813\n\n(Ct. Cl. 1979)). In assessing Plaintiff\u2019s claims, the Court must be cognizant that it is the military\u2014\n\nand not the judiciary\u2014that bears the responsibility for determining the fitness of a service member.\n\nHeisig, 719 F.2d at 1156. \u201c[C]ourts cannot substitute their judgment for that of the military\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fdepartments when reasonable minds could reach differing conclusions on the same evidence.\u201d Id.;\n\nsee, e.g., Reale v. United States, 208 Ct. Cl. 1010, 1013 (1976) (disavowing the idea of the court\n\noperating as \u201ca sort of super Correction Board\u201d); Voge v. United States, 844 F.2d 776, 782 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1988) (citing Reale, 208 Ct. Cl. at 1013).\n\nB.     The BCNR Failed to Consider Important Aspects and Relevant Criteria of the\n       Applicable Naval Disability Regulation in Denying Plaintiff Disability Retirement.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny his request for disability retirement was\n\narbitrary and capricious because the Board failed to consider all relevant factors, as set forth in\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E and the Navy\u2019s Manual of the Medical Department (\u201cMANMED\u201d), 6 and\n\nmade factual findings regarding Plaintiff\u2019s fitness not supported by substantial evidence. ECF No.\n\n10 at 15. Defendant disagrees, arguing that the Board\u2019s determination of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness for\n\nduty at the time of his discharge (and thus ineligibility for disability retirement) was supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. ECF No. 11 at 20. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff waived his\n\narguments related to the Board\u2019s failure to consider all relevant factors necessary to resolve his\n\napplication by not raising those arguments directly to the Board. See id. On these issues, Plaintiff\n\nhas the better claim.\n\n       1.      Plaintiff\u2019s Common Military Tasks\n\n       Under SECNAVINST 1850.4E, the determination of a member\u2019s ability to perform his or\n\nher duties (i.e., fitness for duty) should take into consideration the member\u2019s common military\n\ntasks. Plaintiff argues that, in making its finding, the Board failed as a threshold matter to consider\n\n\u201cwhat tasks [Plaintiff] would be reasonably expected to perform as a Navy diver.\u201d ECF No. 10 at\n\n\n\n       6\n           MANMED establishes specialized standards and physical qualifications for diving duty\nthat must be met for continued diving duty service. See ECF No. 10-1 at 305\u201310 (excerpt of\nMANMED, art. 15-102 (Aug. 12, 2005)). These standards include neurological and psychiatric\ncriteria. See id. at 308\u201309.\n                                                  15\n\f16; see Pl.\u2019s Reply at 12\u201313, ECF No. 12. Instead, Plaintiff asserts that the Board improperly\n\nfocused on Plaintiff\u2019s final two performance evaluations, which covered Plaintiff\u2019s assignment to\n\nthe Naval Academy where his duties were not fully reflective of his service as a Navy diver. ECF\n\nNo. 10 at 16. Defendant argues that no Navy regulation requires the BCNR to assess a member\u2019s\n\ncommon military tasks at the \u201cgranular level\u201d that Plaintiff suggests. Def.\u2019s Reply at 9, ECF No.\n\n13. Rather, it contends that the Board\u2019s reliance on Plaintiff\u2019s final performance evaluations to\n\ndetermine whether he could perform the duties of his rating was rational and in accordance with\n\nnaval regulations, and substantially supported its decision. Id.; see ECF No. 11 at 23.\n\n       SECNAVINST 1850.4E does not define the level of detail required by the common-\n\nmilitary-task consideration. However, the overall standard used for determining disability (which\n\nis essentially the same standard for considering common military tasks) shows that a mere review\n\nof whether a member was adequately performing duties\u2014regardless of what those were\u2014\n\nimmediately before separation is not sufficient. The standard requires \u201crelating the nature and\n\ndegree of physical disability of the member to the requirements and duties that member may\n\nreasonably be expected to perform in his or her office, grade, rank or rating.\u201d SECNAVINST\n\n1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3301 (emphasis added). A disability determination must therefore connect\n\nthe review of a member\u2019s performance of duties with a consideration of the duties that are within\n\nthe member\u2019s common military tasks.             Otherwise, as Defendant correctly observes,\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E makes clear that performance evaluations are relevant evidence of the\n\ncapacity of a member suffering from chronic medical impairments to perform duties reasonably\n\nexpected of him or her. See ECF No. 11 at 23; SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\u00b6 3205, 3303.b.\n\n       Recent cases from other judges of this court provide helpful guidance on this very issue.\n\nSee Nyan v. United States, 153 Fed. Cl. 234 (2021), vacated in part on reconsideration, 154 Fed.\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fCl. 463 (2021); O\u2019Hare v. United States, No. 18-1746C, 2021 WL 3852225 (Fed. Cl. Aug. 27,\n\n2021). Nyan involved a review of a fitness determination made by an Informal Physical Evaluation\n\nBoard (\u201cIPEB\u201d) of a service member employed as a Hospital Corpsman. 153 Fed. Cl. at 242. The\n\ncourt in Nyan held that the IPEB\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence\n\nbecause \u201cthe IPEB did not make any findings regarding what duties a Hospital Corpsman at the\n\nE4 grade is expected to perform.\u201d Id. Instead, the IPEB based its finding on the plaintiff\u2019s most\n\nrecent performance evaluation reflecting his \u201cexceptional\u201d performance of administrative tasks\n\nduring a limited duty assignment. Id. at 242\u201343. In rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that\n\nadministrative tasks also fell within the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s rating, the court observed that the\n\nquestion of fitness was not premised on \u201cwhether [the plaintiff] was disabled from performing any\n\nand all work that a Hospital Corpsman might be assigned to perform, but rather whether he was\n\ndisabled from performing work that a Hospital Corpsman at the E4 grade could \u2018reasonably be\n\nexpected to perform.\u2019\u201d Id. at 243 (quoting SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3301). The court\n\nfound evidence in the administrative record demonstrating that, \u201cas a Hospital Corpsman at the E4\n\ngrade, [the plaintiff] was expected to perform a wide range of duties that went beyond sitting at a\n\ndesk doing paperwork.\u201d Id. The court in Nyan also examined the plaintiff\u2019s duties prior to his\n\nplacement on limited duty and found it \u201cinstructive\u201d that his prior duties were not administrative\n\nin nature. See id. at 244.\n\n       O\u2019Hare involved the review of a BCNR decision denying disability retirement to a service\n\nmember who also was previously employed as a Hospital Corpsman. 2021 WL 3852225, at *1.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the BCNR improperly relied on his final fitness report as evidence that\n\nhe could perform the duties of a Hospital Corpsman because, at the time of the report, he was\n\nperforming only administrative work at the hospital. See id. at *7. The court in O\u2019Hare found the\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fBCNR\u2019s reliance on the fitness report to be reasonable because the Board explicitly determined\n\nthat the plaintiff was working within the scope of his duties when performing the administrative\n\ntasks and the Board\u2019s finding was consistent with the written descriptions of a Hospital\n\nCorpsman\u2019s duties. See id. at *7\u2013*8. The court held that it should defer to the Board\u2019s definition\n\nof a service member\u2019s duties and its \u201cexpress conclusion\u2014supported by the plain text of Navy\n\nregulations\u2014that [the plaintiff\u2019s] administrative activities were within the scope of his duties.\u201d Id.\n\nat *8 (citing Wronke, 787 F.2d at 1576). O\u2019Hare distinguished the facts of Nyan, finding that\n\nunlike in the IPEB decision at issue in Nyan, the BCNR made explicit findings about the types of\n\nduties the plaintiff in O\u2019Hare was expected to perform as a Hospital Corpsman, including the\n\nadministrative work he was successfully performing immediately prior to his separation. See id.\n\n          Here, Plaintiff\u2019s penultimate performance evaluation\u2014covering the period of March 2013\n\nto May 2013\u2014indicates that Plaintiff was at the ND2 rating primarily performing the duties of a\n\nSecond Class Navy Diver, which included the \u201coperation, maintenance, and repair of diving life\n\nsupport equipment.\u201d See AR 156. It also noted that he performed collateral duties including,\n\namong others, funeral honors. Id. According to the evaluation, Plaintiff met the standards in all\n\ncategories of performance traits except for \u201cmilitary bearing/character,\u201d in which he fell below\n\nstandards due to his drunken operation of a vehicle. Id. at 157. The evaluation did not include\n\ncomments on performance providing any further detail about Plaintiff\u2019s duties during this period.\n\nSee id.\n\n          Plaintiff\u2019s final evaluation\u2014covering the period of May 2013 to December 2013\u2014reflects\n\nthat Plaintiff was at the ND3 rating primarily performing the duties of a Maintenance Technician-\n\n4 assigned to the Hull Division of the Small Craft Repair Department. Id. at 154. It also indicates\n\nthat Plaintiff was on temporary duty assignment to Ft. Belvoir Community Hospital from\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fSeptember 24, 2013, to December 13, 2013, which overlaps with the period he received in-patient\n\ntreatment for depression and alcohol disorder. Id.; see id. at 67. Again, according to the\n\nevaluation, Plaintiff met the standards in all categories of performance traits except for \u201cmilitary\n\nbearing/character,\u201d in which he was graded as \u201cprogressing.\u201d See id. at 154\u201355. Like the previous\n\nevaluation, no further information about his duties during this period was provided in the comment\n\nsection. See id. at 155.\n\n       The Board characterized these last two performance evaluations as \u201cobjective evidence,\u201d\n\npersuading it that Plaintiff could perform the duties of his office, grade, rank, or rating despite the\n\nexistence of Plaintiff\u2019s diagnosed disabilities. Id. at 6. The Board found \u201c[m]ost important[]\u201d the\n\nfact that Plaintiff\u2019s final evaluation occurred after the DHA diagnosed Plaintiff with, inter alia,\n\nneurocognitive deficits in its December 9, 2013 report and emphasized that fact as \u201cconvincing\n\nevidence\u201d that Plaintiff was fit to perform his duties. See id. It, however, made no explicit or\n\nimplicit finding regarding what duties a Second Class Navy Diver at the E4 grade is reasonably\n\nexpected to perform or finding that the duties Plaintiff was performing during the periods covered\n\nby the two evaluation reports included such duties. See id. at 5\u20137.\n\n       Moreover, the performance evaluations do not provide much information at all about the\n\nspecific duties Plaintiff was performing at the Naval Academy from March to December 2013.\n\nUnlike all the other evaluations in the record, his final two evaluations lack explanatory comments\n\nabout his duties. Compare id. at 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, with id. at 155, 157. And of course,\n\nPlaintiff was not performing any duties from September 24 to December 13, 2013, while he was\n\nbeing treated at Ft. Belvoir Community Hospital. See id. at 154.\n\n       Citing a Navy Diver rating description provided in MILPERSMAN 1220-100, ch. 43 (May\n\n30, 2013), Plaintiff contends the \u201ccommon duties of a Navy diver include descending into the\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\focean at any depth\u201d and working in, among other conditions, \u201chostile environments that include\n\ncold muddy water where tasks can be completed only by feel.\u201d 7 ECF No. 10 at 16 (citing ECF\n\nNo. 10-1 at 311). Plaintiff asserts that his duties during his last two evaluation periods while\n\nstationed at the Naval Academy involved servicing diving equipment and performing funeral\n\nhonors and, therefore, do not reliably demonstrate that he could perform the duties reasonably\n\nexpected of a Second Class Navy Diver. See id. Plaintiff argues that the Board erred by focusing\n\non these final evaluations, where an examination of his performance evaluations pre-dating his\n\nassignment to the Naval Academy evidenced the types of duties he was reasonably expected to\n\nperform. Id. These previous evaluations depict Plaintiff as a skilled and tireless diver, valuably\n\ncontributing to salvage diving operations and joint naval exercises. See, e.g., AR 161, 165.\n\n       To be sure, Plaintiff\u2019s prior performance evaluations reflect that he operated and\n\nmaintained diving equipment as part of his primary duties as a Second Class Diver prior to his\n\nNaval Academy assignment. See, e.g., id. at 161, 163, 166. He continued to perform those duties\n\nafter transferring to the Naval Academy and before his instances of misconduct. See id. at 158,\n\n159. Like Nyan, however, the record before the BCNR showed that as a Second Class Navy Diver\n\nPlaintiff was expected to perform and did perform a broader range of duties. See id. at 158\u201367.\n\nBecause \u201cthe question is not whether [Plaintiff] was disabled from performing any and all work\n\nthat a [Navy Diver] might be assigned to perform,\u201d that he was maintaining diving equipment\n\nduring the periods covered by the final evaluations does not necessarily equate to a finding that he\n\nwas fit to perform work that a member in his office, grade, rank, or rating would \u201creasonably be\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           Plaintiff attached a number of documents as an appendix to his motion, primarily\nincluding official Navy and Department of Defense regulations and other policies. See generally\nECF No. 10-1. Defendant does not dispute that the Court may consider these policy documents in\nresolving the parties\u2019 motions. ECF No. 11 at 15 n.3.\n                                                20\n\fexpected to perform.\u201d 8 Nyan, 153 Fed. Cl. at 243 (quoting SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3),\n\n\u00b6 3301).\n\n       The deficiencies in the Board\u2019s consideration of Plaintiff\u2019s common military tasks are more\n\npronounced given the extra importance it accorded to his final performance evaluation. See AR 6.\n\nThe Board\u2019s decision did not mention that this evaluation covered a period in which Plaintiff was\n\nprimarily performing the duties of a maintenance technician\u2014not a Second Class Navy Diver. See\n\nid. at 5\u20137. Nor did the decision acknowledge that during the period covered by this evaluation\n\nPlaintiff lost his Second Class Navy Diver classification, see id., which may be why his primary\n\nduty abbreviator changed to maintenance technician, see id. at 154. 9 Because the Board\u2019s decision\n\nfailed to explain the connection between the duties performed by a maintenance technician and the\n\nduties that a Second Class Navy Diver at the E4 grade may reasonably be expected to perform, the\n\nCourt is left to guess whether the Board\u2019s fitness determination properly took these facts into\n\nconsideration. See Nyan, 153 Fed. Cl. at 245; see also Joslyn v. United States, 110 Fed. Cl. 372,\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          Defendant argues that, in addition to maintaining equipment, Plaintiff actually dove while\non assignment at the Naval Academy, showing that he was physically able to dive despite his\nconditions. ECF No. 11 at 25. The performance evaluation on which Defendant relies does not\nclearly establish this fact. Under the topic \u201cMotivated Diver,\u201d the evaluation comments that he\n\u201c[p]layed an essential role in salvage and recovery of eight Yard Patrol craft rub rails from Naval\nSupport Activity, Annapolis basin, saving the Navy $8,000 in replacement costs.\u201d AR 159. It\ndoes not explain what \u201crole\u201d he played. The other activities described under this topic refer to\nqualifications for watchstanding duties, which to the Court\u2019s understanding do not include diving.\nSee id. The topic heading may, therefore, simply refer to his rating and not the performance of\ndiving duties during the evaluation period. Moreover, as Plaintiff notes, even if Plaintiff were\nphysically able to dive, it does not necessarily mean he was medically able to dive. See ECF No.\n12 at 12.\n       9\n           Although the Navy removed his classification on September 24, 2013, see AR 155,\nPlaintiff was discharged with the rating of Third Class Navy Diver, see id. at 399. Therefore, the\npoint remains the same; the record is devoid of any indication that Plaintiff\u2019s capacity to\nsuccessfully perform the duties of a maintenance technician translates to a finding that he could\nsuccessfully perform the duties of a Navy Diver, regardless of the specific classification.\n                                                21\n\f389 (2013) (observing the substantial evidence standard as requiring review of whether military\n\ndisability evaluation board\u2019s decision took into consideration relevant factors).\n\n       That is not to say that the performance evaluations necessarily preclude a fitness\n\ndetermination in this case. It may be possible, for example, that the duties of a maintenance\n\ntechnician sufficiently overlap with the duties of a Navy Diver, making the final performance\n\nevaluation pertinent evidence in assessing Plaintiff\u2019s fitness. See ECF No. 10-1 at 311\u201312\n\n(showing that Navy Divers may be assigned to ship repair units and that civilian occupations\n\nequivalent to the Navy Diver job include \u201cmaintenance and repair workers\u201d). Because this Court\n\ndefers to the BCNR on the substantive question of a service member\u2019s fitness, remand would be\n\nappropriate for the BCNR in the first instance to reconsider Plaintiff\u2019s performance evaluation\n\nreports and further explain its determination with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s common military tasks. See\n\nNyan, 154 Fed. Cl. at 467. As explained below, however, remand is unnecessary since the Board\u2019s\n\ndecision can be upheld on an independent, alternative ground.\n\n       2.      Other Considerations for Determining Reasonable Performance of Duties\n\n       Plaintiff contends that the Board also failed to consider other criteria of SECNAVINST\n\n1850.4E, including Plaintiff\u2019s deployability and the risk Plaintiff\u2019s impairments may have posed\n\nto himself and other service members, as well as the special medical requirements for divers as set\n\nforth in the MANMED. ECF No. 10 at 17\u201318, 19\u201320. In response, Defendant primarily asserts\n\nthat Plaintiff has waived these arguments because he \u201cdid not argue to the BCNR that any\n\ndeployment restrictions, risk to others, or MANMED standards for divers made him physically\n\nunfit for duty.\u201d ECF No. 11 at 26; see ECF No. 13 at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f       In addition to common military tasks, SECNAVINST 1850.4E mandates that a fitness\n\ndetermination \u201cincludes consideration of,\u201d as relevant here, deployability 10 and special\n\nqualifications. SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3304; see id. \u00b6 3307 (identifying special\n\nqualifications to include \u201cdiving qualifications\u201d). MANMED identifies the types of medical\n\nconditions that would cause a service member to lose his or her diving qualifications and is\n\ntherefore relevant to the special-qualifications inquiry mandated by SECNAVINST 1850.4E. See\n\nECF No. 10-1 at 305\u201310. The instruction expressly states that the considerations of deployability\n\nand special qualifications are not to be used individually as a sole basis for determining a service\n\nmember\u2019s fitness. See SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3307. The instruction, however, does\n\nnot foreclose the possibility that these considerations, when evaluated collectively with the other\n\nidentified considerations (including common military tasks), could have the combined effect of\n\nsupporting a determination of unfitness. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 3304, 3307. Therefore, while they are not\n\nindividually determinative, they are relevant considerations that should be examined when\n\nassessing a service member\u2019s fitness. See id. \u00b6 3304. SECNAVINST 1850.4E also allows for\u2014\n\nbut does not require\u2014the consideration of whether a member\u2019s \u201c[m]edical condition represents a\n\ndecided medical risk to the health of the member or to the welfare of other members were the\n\nmember to continue on active duty or in an Active Reserve status.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3302.b.(1).\n\n       There is no dispute that the BCNR\u2019s decision does not reflect the Board\u2019s consideration of\n\nany of the factors identified by Plaintiff\u2014i.e., deployability, special qualifications, and risk.\n\n\n\n       10\n            \u201cDeployable\u201d is defined as a \u201cdetermination that the member is free of a medical\ncondition(s) that prevents positioning the member individually or as part of a unit, with or without\nprior notification, to [a] location outside the [c]ontinental United States for an unspecified period\nof time.\u201d SECNAVIST 1850.4E, encl. (2), \u00b6 2019. \u201cNondeployability does not necessarily equate\nto Unfitness,\u201d id., and the \u201c[i]nability to perform the duties of [the member\u2019s] office, grade, rank,\nor rating in every geographic location and under every conceivable circumstance will not be the\nsole basis for a finding of Unfit,\u201d id., encl. (3), \u00b6 3304.a.(3).\n                                                 23\n\fRather, Defendant argues, primarily relying on two cases, that Plaintiff waived these arguments\n\nby raising them for the first time in the proceedings before this Court. See ECF No. 13 at 11 (citing\n\nMetz and Rock v. United States, 112 Fed. Cl. 113 (2013)). Metz and Rock are distinguishable.\n\nBoth cases involved the waiver of new arguments that could have appropriately been raised during\n\nprior agency proceedings and that, absent being raised, were not arguments that the agency would\n\notherwise reasonably be expected to address. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999 (holding the plaintiff\n\nwaived an ineffective assistance of counsel argument where he did not raise such claim in his\n\npetition to a corrections board for review of his voluntary discharge from the Air Force); Rock,\n\n112 Fed. Cl. at 128 (holding that the plaintiff waived certain arguments that could have been raised\n\nin his administrative appeal of a formal PEB decision assigning him a 20 percent total disability\n\nrating and removing him from the temporary disability retired list).\n\n       Here, unlike in Metz, Plaintiff is not raising \u201cnew\u201d arguments that were not before the\n\nBCNR. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999. The issue before the BCNR was Plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfitness,\n\nand Plaintiff argues that the Board failed to consider relevant criteria and factors that\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E required it to consider when evaluating his claim. See ECF No. 10 at 17\u2013\n\n20. Unlike in Rock, where the plaintiff administratively appealed his fitness determination before\n\nseeking judicial review of the denial of his appeal, Plaintiff was not referred for a formal PEB and\n\nthus this Court is reviewing the Board\u2019s determination in the first instance of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness.\n\nSee Rock, 112 Fed. Cl. at 127\u201328. The nature of Plaintiff\u2019s argument is predicated on the Board\n\nfirst adjudicating his claim because it was only after the Board issued the decision that Plaintiff\n\nbecame aware of and could object to the deficiencies in its application of SECNAVINST 1850.4E.\n\n       Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that the BCNR need not apply aspects of\n\na directly relevant, binding Navy instruction simply because a service member did not specifically\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fidentify the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs applicable to his case. Just as our legal system is\n\nfounded on the notion that individuals interacting with the Government are presumed to know the\n\nlaw, Hermes Consol., Inc. v. United States, 58 Fed. Cl. 409, 416 (2003), rev\u2019d on other grounds\n\nsub nom. Tesoro Hawaii Corp. v. United States, 405 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2005), so too should we\n\nexpect that an administrative body charged with determining the fitness of a service member\n\nknows the legal standard to be applied. There are no meaningful fairness concerns that would\n\nweigh in favor of a waiver finding. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999. Accordingly, the Court finds that\n\nPlaintiff did not waive these arguments by not specifically raising them before the Board.\n\n       Turning to the merits, neither the Board\u2019s determination, nor the advisory opinion on which\n\nit relied, demonstrate any consideration of whether Plaintiff\u2019s medical conditions affected his\n\ndeployability or special qualifications as a Navy Diver. 11 See AR 5\u20137, 127\u201331. As Plaintiff notes,\n\nDepartment of Defense Instruction (\u201cDoDI\u201d) 6490.07 provides that, in general, service members\n\nwith certain medical conditions \u201cshall not deploy unless a waiver is granted.\u201d ECF No. 10-1 at\n\n325 (Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD Civilian\n\nEmployees, DoDI 6490.07, encl. (3) (Feb. 5, 2010)); see ECF No. 10 at 17. This includes, among\n\nothers, conditions that require frequent clinical visits and certain mental health disorders. ECF\n\n\n\n       11\n              Indeed, the Board\u2019s decision does not specifically identify at all the regulatory\nprovisions or other policies that it considered. See AR 5 (stating only that \u201c[d]ocumentary material\nconsidered by the Board consisted of . . . applicable statutes, regulations and policies\u201d); see id. at\n127 (broadly listing as a reference to the CORB advisory opinion the \u201cSECNAVINST 1850.4\nseries\u201d). Nor did Defendant include any regulatory or policy materials in the administrative record,\ndespite the express statement that such documents were reviewed and considered by the Board.\nMarathon Oil Co. v. United States, 17 Cl. Ct. 116, 121 (1989) (\u201c[T]he complete administrative\nrecord . . . consist[s] of \u2018all the documents and materials that were directly or indirectly considered\nby the decision-makers at the time the decisions were rendered.\u2019\u201d (quoting Tenneco Oil Co. v.\nDep\u2019t of Energy, 475 F. Supp. 299 (D. Del. 1979))). It does not escape the Court\u2019s notice that the\nrecord is conspicuously vague as to the regulatory provisions and policies the Board applied, which\nfrustrates the Court\u2019s ability to evaluate whether the Board\u2019s decision-making process followed\nNavy procedures.\n                                                  25\n\fNo. 10-1 at 325, 327. The DHA report demonstrates that shortly before his discharge Plaintiff had\n\npsychological diagnoses of major depressive order and cognitive disorder and suffered from\n\nneurocognitive deficits that \u201crequire[d] ongoing and persistent treatment,\u201d including \u201cbehavioral\n\nhealth, occupational therapy, [and] vocational therapy.\u201d See AR 35.\n\n       Additionally, Plaintiff notes that the MANMED provisions applicable to Navy Divers\n\ndisqualify from diving duty (absent a waiver): service members who have suffered decompression\n\nsickness and are experiencing neurological symptoms; members who have certain psychiatric\n\ndiagnoses; or members who have a diagnosis of alcohol dependency, alcohol abuse, or alcohol\n\nincident and have not completed required treatment. See ECF No. 10-1 at 308\u201309; ECF No. 10 at\n\n19\u201320. Evidence in the administrative record shows Plaintiff has a history of type 2 decompression\n\nsickness, neurocognitive issues, Axis I and II psychiatric diagnoses, and alcohol use disorder. See\n\nAR 35, 39, 67, 78, 219; see also id. at 452 (noting that Plaintiff\u2019s diagnoses \u201caffect[ed] his capacity\n\nto continue diving\u201d).\n\n       Whether and how these considerations would have affected Plaintiff\u2019s fitness\n\ndetermination is not a matter within this Court\u2019s judicial province. Heisig, 719 F.2d at 1156. The\n\nCourt, however, is empowered to review whether the BCNR \u201centirely failed to consider\u201d important\n\nfactors in reaching its determination. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; see Joslyn, 110 Fed. Cl. at 389.\n\nThe Court finds that the Board failed to take into account certain factors that it should have\n\nconsidered pursuant to SECNAVINST 1850.4E in determining that Plaintiff could reasonably\n\nperform his duties and that, as shown by evidence in the record, were relevant to his case. Remand\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fwould therefore be appropriate for the Board to reconsider its decision in light of these additional\n\nconsiderations, see Nyan, 154 Fed. Cl. at 467, but is ultimately unnecessary as explained below. 12\n\nC.     The BCNR\u2019s Determination That Plaintiff\u2019s Separation for Misconduct Took\n       Precedence Was Not Arbitrary and Capricious or Contrary to Law.\n\n       Even though the BCNR\u2019s fitness determination was deficient for the reasons stated above,\n\nthe shortcomings in its decision-making were not harmful or prejudicial. See Christian v. United\n\nStates, 337 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (\u201cTo recover back pay, it is not enough for the\n\nplaintiff to show merely that an error or injustice was committed in the administrative process,\u201d\n\nhe must demonstrate \u201cthat the defect substantially affected the decision to separate him or relieve\n\nhim from active duty . . . .\u201d (quoting Hary v. United States, 618 F.2d 704, 707 (Ct. Cl. 1980))); see\n\nalso Wagner v. United States, 365 F.3d 1358, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2004). That is because the BCNR\n\nfound, regardless of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness or unfitness, that his \u201cmisconduct processing would have\n\ntaken precedence\u201d over disability processing. AR 6; see Fogo De Chao (Holdings), Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 769 F.3d 1127, 1149 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that where an agency\n\ndecision is based on multiple independent grounds a court can affirm the agency on APA review\n\n\u201cso long as any one of the grounds is valid\u201d); see also Holmes v. United States, 98 Fed. Cl. 767,\n\n784\u201385 (2011) (upholding BCNR decision on one of its stated grounds where other stated ground\n\n\n\n\n       12\n             The Court does not find error in the Board failing to explicitly consider whether\nPlaintiff\u2019s impairments posed a risk to himself or others. SECNAVINST 1850.4E states that a\nfitness determination \u201cmay\u201d include an assessment of the risk posed to the welfare of the member,\nas well as other members due to the retention of a service member with a medical condition.\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3302.b. Thus, unlike deployability and special qualifications,\nthe permissive language of the instruction leaves the performance of this risk assessment and its\ninclusion in a determination of a service member\u2019s fitness at the discretion of the relevant naval\nauthorities charged with the responsibility of making the determination. See id. Although not\nrequired, however, the facts of some cases may warrant inclusion of the risk consideration,\nespecially in cases of members who, like Navy Divers, perform particularly hazardous duties.\n                                                 27\n\fwas erroneous). The BCNR\u2019s decision on that point was neither arbitrary and capricious, nor\n\ncontrary to law.\n\n       The Navy disability regulation in effect at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation mandated that\n\n\u201c[p]rocessing for punitive discharge and processing for administrative discharge for misconduct\n\ntakes precedence over processing for disability.\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (1), \u00b6 1002.b; see\n\nid., encl. (3), \u00b6 3203.f.(6) (\u201cThe PEB will reject all cases in which the member is being processed\n\nfor misconduct which could result in the member receiving either a punitive or administrative\n\ndischarge due to that misconduct.\u201d); see also Malcolm v. United States, 752 F. App\u2019x 973, 977 n.2\n\n(Fed. Cir. 2018) (acknowledging that Navy disability regulations mandate misconduct processing\n\ntakes precedence over disability processing). 13 Plaintiff acknowledges the Board\u2019s finding that\n\nmisconduct processing takes precedence over referrals to the DES system as \u201ca correct statement\n\nof Navy policy in effect at the time of [Plaintiff\u2019s] separation.\u201d ECF No. 10 at 20. In that vein,\n\nPlaintiff concedes that the Board \u201cadequately explained why there was no error in the initial denial\n\nof disability retirement.\u201d Id. at 21.\n\n       Plaintiff, however, relies on a June 1, 2016 Memorandum from the Secretary of the Navy\n\n(\u201cDual Processing Memorandum\u201d) to argue that the Secretary has changed this policy and that the\n\nchange should have prompted the BCNR to grant Plaintiff\u2019s request of disability retirement. See\n\nid.; see also ECF No. 10-1 at 313\u201314 (Dual Processing Memorandum). The Dual Processing\n\n\n\n\n       13\n           The Federal Circuit in Malcom noted that, despite the mandate, a plaintiff may be able\nto establish eligibility for benefits under SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3414.b, which\nprohibits holding a service member responsible for his or her acts of misconduct if mental disease\nor defect caused the service member to be unable to appreciate the nature and quality of the\nwrongfulness of the acts. 752 F. App\u2019x at 977 n.2. Here, the Board \u201cfound no evidence that\nsupported an argument [Plaintiff was] not criminally responsible for [his] misconduct and noted\nthat there was no evidence presented in [his] civilian proceedings to indicate any mental\nincompetence.\u201d AR 6. Plaintiff does not challenge that finding in this action.\n                                                28\n\fMemorandum allows service members, who have a ratable condition and are being processed for\n\nany type of involuntary administrative separation, to be referred to the DES. ECF No. 10-1 at 313.\n\nThe immediate effect of the Dual Processing Memorandum marked a noticeable shift in policy\n\nfrom the prior preclusion of such dual processing. See, e.g., SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\n\n3203.f.(6). Plaintiff argues that the Board\u2019s failure to consider the impact of the Dual Processing\n\nMemorandum on Plaintiff\u2019s case renders the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious and in\n\nviolation of the BCNR\u2019s mandate to correct an injustice in a member\u2019s naval records. ECF No.\n\n10 at 21.\n\n       This    argument     suffers    from    both     procedural    and    substantive    flaws.\n\nFirst, as Defendant correctly notes, Plaintiff never raised an argument to the Board based on the\n\nexistence of the Dual Processing Memorandum and its purported application to Plaintiff\u2019s case.\n\nSee ECF No. 11 at 29; see also AR 12\u201322. He could have. The change in policy occurred in June\n\n2016 and was publicized by July 2016, at the latest, several months before Plaintiff submitted his\n\napplication to the Board. See ECF No. 10-1 at 313, 315; see also AR 10. Although Plaintiff\n\ncontends that, \u201c[i]n his response to the medical advisor\u2019s opinion, he specifically argued that his\n\ndisabilities should take precedence over his misconduct separation,\u201d that argument was premised\n\non his interpretation of \u00b6\u00b6 3106 and 3202.b of the applicable instruction (SECNAVINST 1850.4E),\n\nnot any new or changed policy. ECF No. 12 at 13\u201314 (citing AR 17); see AR 17.\n\n       As discussed above, the well-settled principle that arguments not raised before an\n\nadministrative body cannot be first raised on judicial review applies equally to the review of\n\nmilitary correction board decisions. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999; United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck\n\nLines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952) (\u201cSimple fairness to those who are engaged in the tasks of\n\nadministration, and to litigants, requires as a general rule that courts should not topple over\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fadministrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against\n\nobjection made at the time appropriate under its practice.\u201d). The \u201cstandard for assessing whether\n\nan issue was adequately raised before the administrative agency is that \u2018the issue must be raised\n\nwith sufficient specificity and clarity that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in\n\nsufficient time that the agency can do so.\u2019\u201d Conant v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 255 F.3d 1371, 1375\n\n(Fed. Cir. 2001) (quoting Wallace v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).\n\n       Here, the record shows that an argument based on the Dual Processing Memorandum was\n\nnot adequately raised to the BCNR. At best, Plaintiff\u2019s response to the CORB advisory opinion\n\nbroached the subject of whether his misconduct should have precluded him from being referred to\n\nthe PEB based on his disabilities, but it did not specifically or clearly argue that such question\n\nshould be answered by application of a change in policy. Indeed, he supported the argument based\n\non the application of the version of SECNAVINST 1850.4E in effect at the time, which expressly\n\nprecluded dual processing. See AR 17. It cannot therefore be said that the BCNR should have\n\nbeen aware that it must decide the issue of whether the Dual Processing Memorandum applied to\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s case. 14 See Conant, 255 F.3d at 1375. Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendant\n\nand finds Plaintiff has waived his argument premised on the Dual Processing Memorandum.\n\n       Second, the policy is facially inapplicable to Plaintiff because it contemplates application\n\nto \u201cmembers being processed for any type of involuntary [administrative separation].\u201d ECF No.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           For these reasons, the waiver analysis related to the Dual Processing Memorandum leads\nto a different conclusion than the analysis of Plaintiff\u2019s arguments regarding SECNAVINST\n1850.4E considerations. The memorandum is not incorporated in any fashion in the Navy\u2019s\ndisability regulation in effect at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation; indeed, it is contrary to it.\nPlaintiff\u2019s argument that the Dual Processing Memorandum applies retroactively to supplant the\npolicy that was applicable to his separation is a \u201cnew\u201d argument that should have first been raised\nto the BCNR to afford the Board an opportunity to evaluate the argument\u2019s merits. See L.A. Tucker\nTruck Lines, 344 U.S. at 37.\n                                                  30\n\f10-1 at 313 (emphasis added). The language of the Dual Processing Memorandum indicates an\n\nimmediate and prospective effect rather than any retroactive application. As the Supreme Court\n\nhas instructed, \u201c[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law. . . . [A]nd administrative rules will not be\n\nconstrued to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\u201d            Bowen v.\n\nGeorgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988) (citing Greene v. United States, 376 U.S. 149,\n\n160 (1964)).\n\n        Plaintiff argues that an article from \u201cAll Hands\u201d supports retroactive application of the\n\nchange in policy set forth in the Dual Processing Memorandum. ECF No. 10 at 21. The article\n\nstates that \u201c[a]ny service member previously separated under similar circumstances may petition\n\nto have their discharge reviewed through either the discharge review board or Board for Correction\n\nof Naval Records.\u201d ECF No. 10-1 at 315. There is no information in the record regarding the\n\nprovenance of the article, except what is obvious from the printout submitted by Plaintiff. See id.\n\n(indicating that the article was published by Defense Media Activity-Navy Production and written\n\nby a petty officer second class). At the very least, it does not appear to be an official statement of\n\nthe Office of the Secretary of the Navy, and thus has no binding effect. See Hamlet v. United\n\nStates, 63 F.3d 1097, 1103 (Fed. Cir. 1995); see also Dunphy v. United States, 208 Ct. Cl. 986,\n\n989 (1975) (rejecting plaintiff\u2019s argument that an article in the Navy publication \u201cAll Hands\u201d binds\n\nthe Secretary of the Navy because the United States is not \u201cbound by the unauthorized acts of its\n\nagents\u201d) (unpublished). Nor is it persuasive evidence that the Dual Processing Memorandum can\n\nbe interpreted to apply retroactively. ECF No. 10-1 at 315. The article characterizes the\n\nmemorandum as being \u201c[e]ffective immediately.\u201d Id. Its only reference to similarly situated\n\nservice members who were previously separated (other than an explanation in bullet point number\n\none of how the prior policy worked) states that such members may seek to have their discharges\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fadministratively reviewed. Id. It does not make any representation that the Secretary or the review\n\nboards had determined that the Dual Processing Memorandum would be applied to members\n\nseeking such review. See id.\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds no error in the Board\u2019s denial of Plaintiff\u2019s application based\n\non its application of the Navy instruction in effect at the time of his separation, which undisputedly\n\nmade him ineligible for disability processing due to the precedence of his misconduct processing.\n\nBecause the BCNR\u2019s decision can be upheld on that ground, any error in the Board\u2019s decision-\n\nmaking as to its fitness determination was harmless.\n\nD.     The BCNR\u2019s Finding of No Error or Injustice Warranting a Correction to Plaintiff\u2019s\n       Record Was Not Arbitrary and Capricious and Did Not Violate Plaintiff\u2019s Due\n       Process Rights.\n\n       Plaintiff contends that the Board did not adequately explain why, in light of the NDRB\u2019s\n\ndecision, there was no error or injustice in denying Plaintiff disability retirement. ECF No. 10 at\n\n21. According to Plaintiff, the Board should have viewed the NDRB\u2019s decision \u201cthrough the lens\n\nof [c]onstitutional due process requirements.\u201d Id. at 22. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that it was\n\nerroneous and unjust for the Board to rely on Plaintiff\u2019s misconduct processing to deny him\n\ndisability retirement when the NDRB determined that Plaintiff\u2019s medical conditions (related to his\n\nduties as a Navy diver) contributed to his misconduct and thus justified upgrading his discharge\n\ncharacterization and changing his discharge narrative. Id. Defendant argues that Plaintiff\u2019s case\n\ninvolves no due process violation and that the Board adequately considered and rationally\n\nexplained why the NDRB\u2019s decision supported the denial of Plaintiff\u2019s application. See ECF No.\n\n11 at 30\u201331; ECF No. 13 at 15\u201316.\n\n       The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits a person from being \u201cdeprived\n\nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. \u201cDue Process . .\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f. requires specific notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard prior to governmental decisions\n\ndepriving individuals of liberty or property interests.\u201d In re Bailey, 182 F.3d 860, 871 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1999) (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 348 (1976)); see Cushman v. Shinseki, 576 F.3d\n\n1290, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\n       It is well established that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over claims alleging\n\nviolations of the Due Process Clause because such clause is not a money-mandating provision.\n\nSee, e.g., LeBlanc v. United States, 50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1995); James v. Caldera, 159\n\nF.3d 573, 581 (Fed. Cir. 1998). When, however, a constitutional issue arises not as a standalone\n\nclaim but as a factor to a claim of wrongful discharge of a service member, the Court may properly\n\nexercise jurisdiction. See Holley v. United States, 124 F.3d 1462, 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe\n\npresence of a constitutional issue does not erase the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims\n\nbased on a properly brought claim under the Tucker Act, or bar the court from considering the\n\nconstitutional issue in the course of determining whether the discharge was wrongful.\u201d). Here,\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s allegations fall into the latter category. Therefore, the Court may properly consider any\n\nalleged due process violations as part of its broader inquiry into the propriety of the BCNR\u2019s\n\ndecision-making process. See id.\n\n       \u201cTo raise a due process question, the claimant must demonstrate a property interest entitled\n\nto such protections.\u201d Cushman, 576 F.3d at 1296 (citing Richard v. West, 161 F.3d 719, 723 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1998)); see Stone v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\u201cTo have\n\na property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for\n\nit. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim\n\nof entitlement to it.\u201d (quoting Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972))).\n\nDefendant argues that Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that his separation amounted to a deprivation\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fof a property interest triggering due process protections. ECF No. 13 at 15. Instead, as Defendant\n\nasserts, service members possess no right to remain on active duty. See id. (citing, inter alia, Deese\n\nv. Esper, 483 F. Supp. 3d 290, 315 (D. Md. 2020) (\u201cMilitary service members do not have a\n\nproperty interest in their term of enlistment, attendance in military service academies, command\n\nposition, or officer status.\u201d); Paskert v. United States, 20 Cl. Ct. 65, 77 (1990) (\u201cService members\n\nhave no constitutional rights to remain on active duty, and their rights are defined by the applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations.\u201d)). Defendant is correct. \u201cIt is well settled . . . that a service member\u2019s\n\nrights in matters related to pay, allowance, promotion, and demotion are grounded solely on\n\nstatutes and regulations.\u201d Crispino v. United States, 3 Cl. Ct. 306, 313 (1983) (emphasis added)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n        Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserted at oral argument that Cushman held that entitlement to military\n\ndisability benefits is a protectable property interest. Cushman, however, involved the property\n\ninterest of a veteran-applicant for service-connected disability benefits. See 576 F.3d at 1297\u201398.\n\nMilitary disability retirement benefits and veteran disability benefits are derived from wholly\n\ndistinct statutory schemes. See Russell v. United States, 102 Fed. Cl. 9, 17 (2011). This Court\n\nwill not find that same property interest to include military disability benefits in light of established\n\nprecedent. See, e.g., Paskert, 20 Cl. Ct. at 77 (noting military regulations \u201cwere designed\n\nspecifically to give members of the military a useable administrative process by which to present\n\ntheir claims without the entanglements of an entire due process structure\u201d). Accordingly, Plaintiff\n\ncannot claim the Board\u2019s decision violated his due process rights because Plaintiff lacked a\n\nrecognized property interest in the first instance. See id.\n\n        Moreover, it is clear the Board considered the NDRB\u2019s decision and rationally explained\n\nits effect on the Board\u2019s determination. The BCNR stated its agreement with the NDRB\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                   34\n\fconclusion that Plaintiff was \u201cproperly processed and discharged . . . for misconduct\u201d at the time\n\nof his separation. AR 6; see id. at 139 (explaining the NDRB\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s discharge\n\n\u201cwas proper and equitable at the time of discharge\u201d). Just as the NDRB, the Board also found no\n\nevidence to suggest that Plaintiff was not criminally responsible for his misconduct or was\n\nmentally incompetent. Id. at 6; see id. at 138 (explaining the NDRB\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nmisconduct stemmed from \u201cconscious decisions that violate the tenants of honorable and faithful\n\nservice\u201d). Based on these findings, the Board concluded that the misconduct-precedence policy\n\nproperly applied to Plaintiff and, as a result, he was ineligible for disability retirement. Id. at 6.\n\n        Such findings are not inconsistent with, nor do they deprive Plaintiff of the benefit of, the\n\nNDRB\u2019s decision to change his discharge characterization and narrative reason. Although the\n\nBCNR and the NDRB are both naval administrative bodies responsible for reviewing Navy\n\ndischarge or dismissal actions, they do not operate under equivalent mandates. See Vietnam\n\nVeterans of Am. v. Sec\u2019y of Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The NDRB, consisting of\n\nfive Navy officers, reviews discharge actions \u201cto examine the propriety and equity of the\n\napplicant\u2019s discharge\u201d and has the authority to reclassify a discharge where necessary. Lefrancois\n\nv. Mabus, 910 F. Supp. 2d 12, 15 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting SECNAVINST 5420.174D, encl. (5),\n\n\u00a7 501a (Dec. 22, 2004)); see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1553(a), (b)(1). Unlike the NDRB, the BCNR is staffed\n\nby civilians and is charged with \u201ccorrect[ing] any Navy record when \u2018necessary to correct an error\n\nor remove an injustice.\u2019\u201d Vietnam Veterans, 843 F.2d at 531 (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a)). The\n\nBCNR\u2019s mandate \u201chas been viewed as broader than that of the NDRB.\u201d Id. (citing Strang v.\n\nMarsh, 602 F. Supp. 1565, 1570 (D.R.I. 1985)). Accordingly, a decision by the NDRB to afford\n\nrelief based on considerations of equity does not require the Board to find that those same\n\nconsiderations result in error or injustice warranting a correction of records. Indeed, the NDRB\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\ffound no error or inequities with Plaintiff\u2019s discharge at the time. AR 139. Whether post-\n\nseparation circumstances rose to the level of \u201cinjustice\u201d in Plaintiff\u2019s case was a decision within\n\nthe Board\u2019s broad discretion to make. See Murphy v. United States, 993 F.2d 871, 874 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1993) (citing Grieg v. United States, 640 F.2d 1261, 1265 (Ct. Cl. 1981)). Here, the Court finds\n\nnothing arbitrary or capricious about the Board\u2019s consideration or explanation of the NDRB\u2019s\n\ndecision.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the above stated reasons, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record\n\n(ECF No. 9) is hereby DENIED, and Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion for Judgment on the\n\nAdministrative Record (ECF No. 11) is GRANTED. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment\n\naccordingly.\n\n       SO ORDERED.\n\n\nDated: November 19, 2021                                   /s/ Kathryn C.

Before the Court is\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record and Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion for\n\nJudgment on the Administrative Record. For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nMotion and GRANTS Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Statutory and Regulatory Framework for Disability Retirement\n\n       The Secretary of each branch of the armed services possesses the authority to retire a\n\nservice member with retired pay if the Secretary determines the service member is \u201cunfit to\n\nperform the duties of the member\u2019s office, grade, rank or rating because of physical disability\n\nincurred while entitled to basic pay.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a). 1 To be eligible for disability retirement,\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Plaintiff correctly identifies 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 as the money-mandating statute supporting\nthe Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this matter. Pl.\u2019s Compl. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 1; see Fisher v. United States,\n402 F.3d 1167, 1175 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Sawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1580 (Fed.\nCir. 1991)).\n\fthe service member\u2019s disability must be of a permanent nature and not the product of the member\u2019s\n\nown misconduct or neglect. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1201(b)(1), (b)(2). Additionally, disability retirement is\n\navailable only to members who have either 20 years of service or whose disability is at least 30\n\npercent under the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Schedule for Ratings Disabilities and\n\nwas incurred in, among other circumstances, the line of duty. Id. \u00a7 1201(b)(3). Congress has\n\nauthorized the Secretary concerned to prescribe regulations implementing the statutory provisions\n\ngoverning retirement or separation due to physical disability. Id. \u00a7 1216(a).\n\n        The relevant regulation in Plaintiff\u2019s case is Secretary of the Navy Instruction\n\n(\u201cSECNAVINST\u201d) 1850.4E, which defined the applicable standards and procedures used by the\n\nNavy to adjudicate disability cases at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation. Pursuant to the instruction,\n\na Physical Evaluation Board (\u201cPEB\u201d) acts on behalf of the Secretary of the Navy to determine a\n\nmember\u2019s fitness to continue naval service and entitlement to disability benefits. See Department\n\nof Navy (DON) Disability Evaluation Manual, SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (1), \u00b6 1004.a (Apr.\n\n30, 2002) (describing PEB procedures as part of the Navy\u2019s Disability Evaluation System\n\n(\u201cDES\u201d)).      In assessing whether a service member is eligible for disability retirement,\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E provides that:\n\n        The sole standard to be used in making determinations of physical disability as a\n        basis for retirement or separation is unfitness to perform the duties of office, grade,\n        rank or rating because of disease or injury incurred or aggravated while entitled to\n        basic pay. Each case is considered by relating the nature and degree of physical\n        disability of the member to requirements and duties that member may reasonably\n        be expected to perform in his or her office, grade, rank or rating.\n\nId., encl. (3), \u00b6 3301. 2\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           The instruction similarly defines unfitness as an inability to \u201creasonably perform the\nduties of office, grade, rank or rating.\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (2), \u00b6 2085.\n                                                  2\n\f       The instruction provides four considerations for the PEB to assess in determining whether\n\na service member can reasonably perform his or her duties: (1) common military tasks, i.e.,\n\nwhether the member is unable to reasonably perform routine assignments expected of his or her\n\noffice, grade, rank or rating; (2) physical readiness/fitness tests, i.e., whether the member\u2019s\n\ncondition prohibits him or her from taking all or part of physical readiness/fitness tests; (3)\n\ndeployability, i.e., whether the member\u2019s condition prevents him or her from being positioned\n\noutside the continental United States for an unspecified amount of time; and (4) special\n\nqualifications, i.e., whether the member\u2019s condition causes the loss of any specialized\n\nqualifications. Id. \u00b6 3304. Notably, the standards utilized for a disability determination and for\n\nconsidering common military tasks are effectively interchangeable: both assess whether the\n\nmember can reasonably perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating. See id.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 3301, 3302.a, 3304.a.(1). Therefore, a finding that a service member cannot perform his or her\n\ncommon military tasks is dispositive to the ultimate question of the member\u2019s unfitness. By\n\ncontrast, the considerations of deployability, physical fitness test, and special qualifications cannot\n\nbe used individually as the sole basis for a finding of unfitness. See id. \u00b6 3307.\n\n       In addition to the four considerations, the instruction also provides that the PEB may\n\nevaluate other general criteria when determining a member\u2019s unfitness, including, as relevant here,\n\nwhether a member\u2019s condition poses a medical risk to the member (or other members) were the\n\nmember to be retained on active duty and whether the condition imposes unreasonable\n\nrequirements on the military to maintain or protect the member. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3302.b.(1), (2).\n\n       \u201c[I]n assessing service member fitness, including the circumstances of referral [to the\n\nDES],\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E instructs the PEB to \u201c[c]onsider all relevant evidence,\u201d id. \u00b6 3303,\n\nand make a finding of fitness or unfitness based on a preponderance of the evidence, id. \u00b6 3306.b.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fThe instruction recognizes that in certain circumstances performance evaluations \u201cmay provide\n\nbetter evidence than a clinical estimate by a physician of the service member\u2019s ability to perform\n\nhis or her duties.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3303.b; see id. \u00b6 3205. It also provides that a member can be determined\n\nfit based on a finding that he or she adequately performed duties until the time of referral for DES\n\nprocessing, even if medical evidence calls into question his or her physical ability to continue to\n\nperform those duties. Id. \u00b6 3303.c.\n\n       Notably, SECNAVINST 1850.4E does not apply to a member who is pending\n\nadministrative discharge for misconduct. See id., encl. (1), \u00b6 1002.b. According to the instruction,\n\n\u201cprocessing for administrative discharge for misconduct takes precedence over processing for\n\ndisability.\u201d Id.\n\n       Although Plaintiff was never referred to the PEB for evaluation before the Navy discharged\n\nhim, the standard and related considerations established in SECNAVINST 1850.4E, as discussed\n\nabove, guide the Court in evaluating the propriety of the BCNR\u2019s decision-making process. See\n\nSawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (recognizing the BCNR \u201cis\n\ncompetent to make a disability determination in the first instance\u201d); Beckham v. United States, 392\n\nF.2d 619, 622 (Ct. Cl. 1968) (recognizing the BCNR, \u201clike other administrative bodies, is bound\n\nby its own regulations\u201d).\n\nB.     Findings of Fact\n\n       Plaintiff enlisted in the United States Navy and entered active duty on November 12, 2008.\n\nAdmin. R. 146, 153, ECF No. 8 (\u201cAR\u201d). Within a year of enlisting, Plaintiff graduated from diving\n\nschool and qualified as a Second Class Navy Diver. Id. at 401\u201302. Plaintiff was then assigned to\n\nMobile Diving and Salvage Company Two where he performed numerous dives as part of salvage\n\noperations and joint naval exercises from at least January 2009 until October 2012. Id. at 160\u201366.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fA performance evaluation report from this period characterizes Plaintiff as a \u201cdevoted and tireless\n\nperformer,\u201d reflecting the integral and admired nature of his skills as a diver. See id. at 165; see\n\nalso id. at 163 (describing Plaintiff as an \u201ceffective team member with job accomplishment as a\n\ntop priority\u201d); id. at 161 (praising, among other qualities, Plaintiff\u2019s diving and management\n\nskills). In March 2010, Plaintiff earned the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal and the\n\nHumanitarian Service Medal for the superior performance of his duties during a deployment to\n\nHaiti where he cleared and assisted in the re-opening of critical commercial seaports damaged\n\nduring the earthquake that occurred there earlier that year. Id. at 167, 400.\n\n       After his deployment to Haiti, Plaintiff was deployed to the Persian Gulf in September\n\n2010 where he conducted 41 anti-terrorism force protection dives and served as lead diver for three\n\nother dives. Id. at 165. In July 2012, he participated in a mission to Canada where his efforts\n\nproved \u201cvital\u201d in a diving operation, in which he successfully excavated, recovered, and repatriated\n\nthree U.S. Army Air Corps personnel lost since 1942 in 120 feet of water off the coast of Nova\n\nScotia. Id. at 39, 161.\n\n       Diving is a hazardous occupation in the Navy and, unfortunately, Plaintiff suffered two\n\ndiving-related medical events during his military service. In 2010, he experienced a head trauma\n\nas a result of striking his head during a dive. 3 Id. at 8, 39, 77. Additionally, during a dive in\n\nsupport of the mission to Nova Scotia, Plaintiff suffered from hypoxia and type 2 decompression\n\nsickness. Id. at 39, 78. In relation to the latter event, crew members pulled Plaintiff out of the\n\nwater after he lost consciousness, and a doctor examined him before he returned to service later\n\nthat same day. Id. at 39. Following this event of hypoxia, Plaintiff reportedly began experiencing\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Plaintiff also experienced a second head injury in 2012 when he hit his head on the\nground while playing recreational football. AR 8, 39, 78.\n                                                 5\n\femotional and behavioral changes and consuming alcohol excessively. Id. at 39, 78. It was during\n\nthis time in 2012 that Plaintiff also separated from his wife. Id. at 39.\n\n       In October 2012, the Navy transferred Plaintiff to the United States Naval Academy in\n\nAnnapolis, Maryland. Id. at 158. Within months, Plaintiff\u2019s conduct began to suffer. In January\n\n2013, he was counseled for an unauthorized absence from a command physical fitness session and\n\nsubstandard appearance during a command indoctrination course. Id. at 417. Plaintiff received\n\nfurther counseling in March 2013 after being cited by local law enforcement for reckless driving\n\nafter he was stopped for speeding in a government-issued vehicle. Id. at 418. Then, on April 14,\n\n2013, Plaintiff was cited by the Annapolis Police Department for, among other charges, driving a\n\nvehicle while impaired by alcohol (\u201cDWI\u201d). Id. at 420. Plaintiff\u2019s medical records show that,\n\nduring this period of frequent misconduct, he received some outpatient mental health treatment.\n\nA February 2013 mental health record notes diagnoses of adjustment disorder with anxiety and\n\ndepressed mood, as well as marital problems. Id. at 219.\n\n       As a result of the DWI citation, the Navy issued Plaintiff a non-judicial punishment\n\n(\u201cNJP\u201d), which included, inter alia, forfeiture of pay, reduction in pay rate, and community\n\nservice. Id. at 157, 422. The aspects of the NJP related to Plaintiff\u2019s pay were suspended for six\n\nmonths. Id. at 422. Because of the NJP, the Navy conducted a performance evaluation of Plaintiff,\n\ncovering the period of March 16, 2013, to May 13, 2013. Id. at 156\u201357. This evaluation described\n\nPlaintiff as \u201can above average Sailor who made a serious mistake\u201d from which he could recover\n\nwith mentoring and strong personal desire. Id. at 157. It reflected that Plaintiff at that time\n\nadequately performed the duties of a Second Class Navy Diver, which included the operation,\n\nmaintenance, and repair of diving equipment, and collateral duties including the performance of\n\nfuneral honors. Id. at 156. Plaintiff was rated as meeting standards in all categories, except for\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f\u201cmilitary bearing/character.\u201d Id. at 156\u201357. After issuing the NJP, it appears the Navy also\n\nsuspended Plaintiff\u2019s diving qualifications due, in part, to \u201cpersonal issues\u201d identified as \u201cfamily\n\nseparation\u201d and Plaintiff\u2019s receipt of the March 2013 speeding ticket while driving in a government\n\nvehicle. Id. at 435 (noting that Plaintiff was \u201con a suspend bust from the former Commandant this\n\nspring\u201d).\n\n       Finally, on July 21, 2013, the Annapolis Police Department arrested Plaintiff for theft,\n\ndisorderly conduct, and resisting arrest after he left a restaurant without paying his bill. Id. at 426.\n\nThe arresting officer observed that Plaintiff\u2019s eyes were watery and glassy, his speech slurred, and\n\nhis breath emitted a strong odor of alcohol. Id. On July 30, 2013, Plaintiff received notice that\n\nthe Navy was processing him for administrative separation due to misconduct, specifically the\n\ncommission of a serious offense. Id. at 149\u201350. The Navy additionally vacated the suspension of\n\nthe forfeiture of pay and reduction in pay rate aspects of his earlier NJP. Id. at 433. It also removed\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s Second Class Diver classification on September 24, 2013. Id. at 155.\n\n       Between August and December 2013, Plaintiff was temporarily assigned to Fort Belvoir\n\nCommunity Hospital in Virginia where he successfully graduated from a military in-patient\n\nrehabilitation program and an outpatient dual-diagnoses therapy program where he was treated for\n\ndepression and alcohol use disorder. Id. at 67, 113, 154. During his time at Fort Belvoir\n\nCommunity Hospital, Plaintiff underwent neuropsychological testing to evaluate whether he\n\nsuffered from a traumatic brain injury (\u201cTBI\u201d). Id. at 35. According to the December 9, 2013\n\nreport of the Defense Health Agency (\u201cDHA\u201d), the evaluation concluded that Plaintiff had\n\nneurocognitive deficits that required \u201congoing and persistent treatment.\u201d Id. These deficits\n\nincluded \u201ccircumscribed cognitive difficulties on tasks requiring mental processing speed, slowed\n\nfine motor and dexterity and visuospatial processing, complex problem solving[,] and memory.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fId. The DHA report concluded that some of Plaintiff\u2019s cognitive difficulties were attributable to\n\nmultiple etiologies including childhood maltreatment, fetal alcohol exposure, and hypoxia\n\nepisodes from multiple long-term dives and reduced oxygen saturation. Id. It also noted Plaintiff\u2019s\n\n\u201crepeated symptom of \u2018odd\u2019 sensory feelings and reduced motor functioning from dives,\u201d as well\n\nas evidence of a small cyst in his brain complicating his sensory and motor functioning. Id. at 36.\n\nPlaintiff was ultimately diagnosed with major depressive disorder, cognitive disorder, antisocial\n\ntraits, potential hypoxia, and retrocerebellar cyst. Id.\n\n       On December 6, 2013, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy issued a decision to\n\ndischarge Plaintiff due to his misconduct. Id. at 145. Plaintiff\u2019s separation caused a final\n\nperformance evaluation to be conducted, covering the period of May 14, 2013, to December 20,\n\n2013. Id. at 154\u201355. The evaluation report noted Plaintiff was performing the duties of a\n\nmaintenance technician during this period, and his performance was evaluated as \u201cmeeting\n\nstandards\u201d for all categories of performance traits except for the trait of \u201cmilitary\n\nbearing/character.\u201d Id. Plaintiff also underwent a pre-separation medical assessment, which noted\n\nthat \u201cTBI, depression and anxiety disorder affect[ed] [Plaintiff\u2019s] capacity to continue diving.\u201d Id.\n\nat 452; see id. at 453 (listing diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, and\n\n\u201cneurological [and] cognitive impairment\u201d). Nonetheless, the assessment found Plaintiff qualified\n\nfor service and separation. Id. at 453.\n\n       Although his command had become aware of Plaintiff\u2019s TBI evaluation and neurocognitive\n\ndeficits during the separation process, id. at 436\u201337, Plaintiff was officially discharged from the\n\nNavy for misconduct on December 20, 2013, with his rate reflecting \u201cND3\u201d or Third Class Navy\n\nDiver, and the character of his service noted as \u201cunder honorable conditions (general),\u201d id. at 399.\n\nSee also id. at 146\u201348.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fC.     Procedural Background\n\n       1.      Decision of the Naval Discharge Review Board (\u201cNDRB\u201d)\n\n       On February 3, 2015, Plaintiff sought a change in his characterization of and narrative\n\nreason for discharge from the NDRB on equity and propriety grounds.                Id. at 370, 372.\n\nSpecifically, Plaintiff requested a discharge upgrade from a general to honorable characterization\n\nand an alteration to the statements of narrative reason and separation authority included on his\n\ndischarge document. Id. at 372.\n\n       After providing an in-person hearing, the NDRB rendered its final decision on October 14,\n\n2015, granting Plaintiff\u2019s request for relief. Id. at 134. The NDRB considered each of the issues\n\nraised by Plaintiff, rejecting all his arguments alleging that the Navy committed some type of legal\n\nerror preceding and/or during the separation process. Id. at 135\u201338. It specifically found that\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s July 2013 arrest was the result of \u201cconscious decisions that violate[d] the tenants of\n\nhonorable and faithful service.\u201d Id. at 138.\n\n       The NDRB, however, determined that relief was warranted \u201cbased on equitable grounds\n\ndue to [Plaintiff\u2019s] service connected cognitive defects.\u201d Id. (finding the \u201crecord of evidence\n\nclearly show[ed] [Plaintiff] was engaged in hazardous service that resulted in a definite,\n\ndocumented, causal relationship between his hazardous service and his resulting disabilities\u201d).\n\nThe NDRB acknowledged that, although Plaintiff \u201cincurred his disabilities from his hazardous\n\nservice,\u201d that was \u201cnot sufficient by itself to support an upgrade determination.\u201d Id. Rather, the\n\nNDRB based its decision on the \u201ctotality of [Plaintiff\u2019s] service record, the start date of his mental\n\nhealth counseling and evaluation, the manifestation dates of his misconduct, and his post-service\n\nactions and treatment records with respect to the equity of his discharge characterization and\n\nnarrative reason for separation.\u201d Id. Notably, the NDRB \u201cfound [Plaintiff\u2019s] discharge was proper\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fand equitable at the time of discharge.\u201d Id. at 139. It based its upgrade determination \u201con matters\n\nof equity related to [Plaintiff\u2019s] post-service diagnoses of medical conditions related to his\n\nhazardous duty diving operations.\u201d Id. at 139. On that ground alone, the NDRB directed that\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s discharge be changed to \u201chonorable\u201d and the narrative reason be changed to \u201csecretarial\n\nauthority.\u201d Id.\n\n       2.         Decision of the BCNR\n\n       On December 20, 2016, over a year after the NDRB upgraded his discharge, Plaintiff\n\nsubmitted an application to the BCNR requesting the Board correct his military records to reflect\n\na disability retirement. Id. at 10. Plaintiff asserted that the NDRB\u2019s decision to upgrade his\n\ncharacterization to a fully honorable discharge, in addition to his VA disability rating, entitled him\n\nto an award of 60 percent military medical retirement pay. 4 Id.\n\n       On July 19, 2017, the Chairman of the BCNR requested comments and recommendations\n\non Plaintiff\u2019s claim from the Director of the Navy\u2019s Council of Review Boards (\u201cCORB\u201d). Id. at\n\n125. In response, an advisor of the Senior Medical Officer of CORB issued an advisory opinion\n\nconcluding that his review of the available evidence did not support Plaintiff\u2019s request for\n\ndisability retirement. Id. at 127. In sum, the advisor stated that \u201cobjective evidence\u201d established\n\nPlaintiff performed his duties adequately at the time of his separation. Id. at 130. He further noted\n\nthat Plaintiff\u2019s \u201clargely alcohol-related misconduct . . . appears to have led to his discharge,\u201d and\n\nthe misconduct did not \u201cresult[] from a legally exculpating level of psychological impairment\n\nincident to a potentially compensable psychiatric condition.\u201d Id. Finally, the advisor observed\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          In September 2014, the VA issued Plaintiff a combined disability rating of 60 percent\nresulting from his medical impairments, which included tinnitus, major depressive disorder,\ncognitive deficits, and motor slowing due to decompression sickness and hypoxic episodes. AR\n462\u201366.\n                                                 10\n\fthat, per his review of the record, none of \u201cthe involved health care evaluators and providers of\n\nrecord contemporary with [Plaintiff\u2019s] active service felt him to be unfit or that referral to the . . .\n\nPEB was warranted.\u201d Id. Had such a referral occurred, the advisor opined that \u201ca finding of fit to\n\ncontinue naval service would have been the likely result.\u201d Id. at 131. On October 31, 2017, the\n\nDirector of CORB concurred with the recommendation of the Senior Medical Advisor. Id. at 132.\n\n        In a letter dated December 12, 2017, serving as a rebuttal to the CORB advisory opinion,\n\nPlaintiff\u2014through counsel\u2014argued that he \u201csuffered from significant cognitive and emotional\n\nimpairment as well as untreated PTSD at the time of separation\u201d and that a \u201cpreponderance of the\n\nevidence suggest[ed] that these medical impairments directly relate[d] back to [Plaintiff\u2019s] in-\n\nservice injuries and existed in 2013.\u201d Id. at 13. Plaintiff disagreed with several of the Senior\n\nMedical Advisor\u2019s assertions, including that: Plaintiff\u2019s alcohol-related misconduct that resulted\n\nin his separation did not result from a \u201clegally exculpating level of psychological impairment\n\nincident to a potentially compensable psychiatric condition,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s impairments did not\n\nwarrant a referral to the PEB, or a referral would have resulted in a finding of Plaintiff being fit\n\nfor continued naval service. Id. at 13\u201317. Plaintiff argued that SECNAVINST 1850.4E required\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s referral to the PEB instead of being administratively separated. See id. at 17 (citing\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\u00b6 3106, 3202.g). 5 Plaintiff offered no additional or alternative\n\nbases to argue that his disabilities should have prevented his separation or taken precedence over\n\nhis separation due to misconduct. See id.\n\n        The BCNR denied Plaintiff\u2019s application on February 5, 2018, finding no error or injustice\n\nwarranted correction to Plaintiff\u2019s record. Id. at 5\u20136. The Board also rejected Plaintiff\u2019s request\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          Plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal letter cites \u00b6 3202.b of SECNAVINST 1850.4E; however, the\nlanguage quoted in the letter appears in \u00b6 3202.g. See AR 17.\n                                                  11\n\fto personally appear before it and considered Plaintiff\u2019s case based on the record. Id. at 6\u20137. The\n\nBoard \u201csubstantially concurred\u201d with the CORB advisory opinion and found that objective\n\nevidence, i.e., Plaintiff\u2019s last two performance evaluations from 2013, showed that Plaintiff\n\nadequately performed the duties of his office, grade, rank, or rating, despite his diagnosed\n\ndisabilities. Id. at 6. The Board also concurred with the NDRB\u2019s finding that the Navy properly\n\nprocessed and discharged Plaintiff for misconduct. Id. Like the NDRB, the Board found no\n\nevidence demonstrating that Plaintiff was not criminally responsible for his misconduct, such as\n\nany evidence indicating mental incompetence. Id. Because of this, even assuming the record\n\nsupported a finding of unfitness, the Board concluded that Plaintiff\u2019s misconduct separation\n\nprocessing took precedence over any right to be referred to the DES. Id.\n\n       3.      The Instant Action\n\n       Plaintiff filed suit in this Court on May 8, 2020. Pl.\u2019s Compl., ECF No. 1. In accordance\n\nwith the Court\u2019s scheduling order, see ECF No. 7, Defendant filed the Administrative Record on\n\nAugust 14, 2020, see ECF No. 8. On September 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Judgment\n\non the Administrative Record, arguing that the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny him placement on the\n\ndisability retirement list was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and/or unsupported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. See Pl.\u2019s Mot. for J. on Admin. R., ECF No. 9; Pl.\u2019s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nJ. on Admin. R., ECF No. 10; Pl.\u2019s App., ECF No. 10-1. According to Plaintiff, the Board failed\n\nto properly apply and adhere to relevant naval disability retirement regulations, under which he\n\nshould have been found unfit at the time of his separation, and naval policies issued after his\n\nseparation that support the prioritization of disability retirement over separation based on\n\nmisconduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f       Defendant subsequently cross-moved for judgment on the administrative record, asserting\n\nthat the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny Plaintiff\u2019s request for disability retirement was rational and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. See Def.\u2019s Cross Mot. for J. on Admin. R., ECF No. 11.\n\nAccording to Defendant, the Board reasonably determined that (1) Plaintiff was able to perform\n\nhis duties at the time of his separation despite his medical conditions, and (2) his misconduct\n\nproceedings took precedence over his disability processing.\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       Pursuant to RCFC 52.1, judgment on the administrative record is \u201cproperly understood as\n\n. . . an expedited trial on the record.\u201d Bannum, Inc. v. United States, 404 F.3d 1346, 1356 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2005). In contrast to the standard for summary judgment, \u201cthe standard for judgment on the\n\nadministrative record is narrower\u201d and involves determining, \u201cgiven all the disputed and\n\nundisputed facts in the administrative record, whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof to\n\nshow that the [challenged] decision was not in accordance with the law.\u201d Martinez v. United\n\nStates, 77 Fed. Cl. 318, 324 (2007) (citing Bannum, 404 F.3d at 1357). Therefore, a genuine issue\n\nof disputed fact does not prevent a court from granting a motion for judgment on the administrative\n\nrecord. See Bannum, 404 F.3d at 1357.\n\n       For military pay cases, a court will not disturb a decision rendered by a military correction\n\nboard unless the decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or unsupported by substantial\n\nevidence.\u201d See Barnes v. United States, 473 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A decision is\n\narbitrary and capricious when the agency decision-maker, such as the BCNR, \u201centirely failed to\n\nconsider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs\n\ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fdifference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm\n\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); see Metz v. United States, 466 F.3d 991, 998 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2006) (\u201c[W]hen a service member does pursue . . . relief [from a military correction board],\n\nthe Court of Federal Claims reviews the Board\u2019s action under the same [Administrative Procedure\n\nAct (\u201cAPA\u201d)] standard as any other agency action.\u201d (citing Martinez v. United States, 333 F.3d\n\n1295, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2003))). Applying the APA standard of review does not require \u201ca\n\nreweighing of the evidence, but [simply] a determination whether the conclusion being reviewed\n\nis supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Heisig v. United States, 719 F.2d 1153, 1157 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1983). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something less than the weight of the evidence but more than a\n\nmere scintilla of evidence.\u201d In re NuVasive, Inc., 842 F.3d 1376, 1379\u201380 (Fed. Cir. 2016)\n\n(quoting In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). If a reasonable mind would accept\n\nthe evidence as adequate to support a conclusion, the evidence is substantial. See Consol. Edison\n\nCo. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).\n\n       Given this standard, the Court\u2019s review of a military correction board\u2019s decision-making\n\nprocess is \u201cnecessarily limit[ed] . . . to the administrative record.\u201d Metz, 466 F.3d at 998. The\n\nplaintiff has the burden to prove the board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious through \u201ccogent\n\nand clearly convincing evidence,\u201d Wronke v. Marsh, 787 F.2d 1569, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and\n\n\u201cmust overcome the strong, but rebuttable, presumption that the administrators of the military, like\n\nother public officers, discharge their duties correctly, lawfully, and in good faith,\u201d Porter v. United\n\nStates, 163 F.3d 1304, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting Sanders v. United States, 594 F.2d 804, 813\n\n(Ct. Cl. 1979)). In assessing Plaintiff\u2019s claims, the Court must be cognizant that it is the military\u2014\n\nand not the judiciary\u2014that bears the responsibility for determining the fitness of a service member.\n\nHeisig, 719 F.2d at 1156. \u201c[C]ourts cannot substitute their judgment for that of the military\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fdepartments when reasonable minds could reach differing conclusions on the same evidence.\u201d Id.;\n\nsee, e.g., Reale v. United States, 208 Ct. Cl. 1010, 1013 (1976) (disavowing the idea of the court\n\noperating as \u201ca sort of super Correction Board\u201d); Voge v. United States, 844 F.2d 776, 782 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1988) (citing Reale, 208 Ct. Cl. at 1013).\n\nB.     The BCNR Failed to Consider Important Aspects and Relevant Criteria of the\n       Applicable Naval Disability Regulation in Denying Plaintiff Disability Retirement.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny his request for disability retirement was\n\narbitrary and capricious because the Board failed to consider all relevant factors, as set forth in\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E and the Navy\u2019s Manual of the Medical Department (\u201cMANMED\u201d), 6 and\n\nmade factual findings regarding Plaintiff\u2019s fitness not supported by substantial evidence. ECF No.\n\n10 at 15. Defendant disagrees, arguing that the Board\u2019s determination of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness for\n\nduty at the time of his discharge (and thus ineligibility for disability retirement) was supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. ECF No. 11 at 20. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff waived his\n\narguments related to the Board\u2019s failure to consider all relevant factors necessary to resolve his\n\napplication by not raising those arguments directly to the Board. See id. On these issues, Plaintiff\n\nhas the better claim.\n\n       1.      Plaintiff\u2019s Common Military Tasks\n\n       Under SECNAVINST 1850.4E, the determination of a member\u2019s ability to perform his or\n\nher duties (i.e., fitness for duty) should take into consideration the member\u2019s common military\n\ntasks. Plaintiff argues that, in making its finding, the Board failed as a threshold matter to consider\n\n\u201cwhat tasks [Plaintiff] would be reasonably expected to perform as a Navy diver.\u201d ECF No. 10 at\n\n\n\n       6\n           MANMED establishes specialized standards and physical qualifications for diving duty\nthat must be met for continued diving duty service. See ECF No. 10-1 at 305\u201310 (excerpt of\nMANMED, art. 15-102 (Aug. 12, 2005)). These standards include neurological and psychiatric\ncriteria. See id. at 308\u201309.\n                                                  15\n\f16; see Pl.\u2019s Reply at 12\u201313, ECF No. 12. Instead, Plaintiff asserts that the Board improperly\n\nfocused on Plaintiff\u2019s final two performance evaluations, which covered Plaintiff\u2019s assignment to\n\nthe Naval Academy where his duties were not fully reflective of his service as a Navy diver. ECF\n\nNo. 10 at 16. Defendant argues that no Navy regulation requires the BCNR to assess a member\u2019s\n\ncommon military tasks at the \u201cgranular level\u201d that Plaintiff suggests. Def.\u2019s Reply at 9, ECF No.\n\n13. Rather, it contends that the Board\u2019s reliance on Plaintiff\u2019s final performance evaluations to\n\ndetermine whether he could perform the duties of his rating was rational and in accordance with\n\nnaval regulations, and substantially supported its decision. Id.; see ECF No. 11 at 23.\n\n       SECNAVINST 1850.4E does not define the level of detail required by the common-\n\nmilitary-task consideration. However, the overall standard used for determining disability (which\n\nis essentially the same standard for considering common military tasks) shows that a mere review\n\nof whether a member was adequately performing duties\u2014regardless of what those were\u2014\n\nimmediately before separation is not sufficient. The standard requires \u201crelating the nature and\n\ndegree of physical disability of the member to the requirements and duties that member may\n\nreasonably be expected to perform in his or her office, grade, rank or rating.\u201d SECNAVINST\n\n1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3301 (emphasis added). A disability determination must therefore connect\n\nthe review of a member\u2019s performance of duties with a consideration of the duties that are within\n\nthe member\u2019s common military tasks.             Otherwise, as Defendant correctly observes,\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E makes clear that performance evaluations are relevant evidence of the\n\ncapacity of a member suffering from chronic medical impairments to perform duties reasonably\n\nexpected of him or her. See ECF No. 11 at 23; SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\u00b6 3205, 3303.b.\n\n       Recent cases from other judges of this court provide helpful guidance on this very issue.\n\nSee Nyan v. United States, 153 Fed. Cl. 234 (2021), vacated in part on reconsideration, 154 Fed.\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fCl. 463 (2021); O\u2019Hare v. United States, No. 18-1746C, 2021 WL 3852225 (Fed. Cl. Aug. 27,\n\n2021). Nyan involved a review of a fitness determination made by an Informal Physical Evaluation\n\nBoard (\u201cIPEB\u201d) of a service member employed as a Hospital Corpsman. 153 Fed. Cl. at 242. The\n\ncourt in Nyan held that the IPEB\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence\n\nbecause \u201cthe IPEB did not make any findings regarding what duties a Hospital Corpsman at the\n\nE4 grade is expected to perform.\u201d Id. Instead, the IPEB based its finding on the plaintiff\u2019s most\n\nrecent performance evaluation reflecting his \u201cexceptional\u201d performance of administrative tasks\n\nduring a limited duty assignment. Id. at 242\u201343. In rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that\n\nadministrative tasks also fell within the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s rating, the court observed that the\n\nquestion of fitness was not premised on \u201cwhether [the plaintiff] was disabled from performing any\n\nand all work that a Hospital Corpsman might be assigned to perform, but rather whether he was\n\ndisabled from performing work that a Hospital Corpsman at the E4 grade could \u2018reasonably be\n\nexpected to perform.\u2019\u201d Id. at 243 (quoting SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3301). The court\n\nfound evidence in the administrative record demonstrating that, \u201cas a Hospital Corpsman at the E4\n\ngrade, [the plaintiff] was expected to perform a wide range of duties that went beyond sitting at a\n\ndesk doing paperwork.\u201d Id. The court in Nyan also examined the plaintiff\u2019s duties prior to his\n\nplacement on limited duty and found it \u201cinstructive\u201d that his prior duties were not administrative\n\nin nature. See id. at 244.\n\n       O\u2019Hare involved the review of a BCNR decision denying disability retirement to a service\n\nmember who also was previously employed as a Hospital Corpsman. 2021 WL 3852225, at *1.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the BCNR improperly relied on his final fitness report as evidence that\n\nhe could perform the duties of a Hospital Corpsman because, at the time of the report, he was\n\nperforming only administrative work at the hospital. See id. at *7. The court in O\u2019Hare found the\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fBCNR\u2019s reliance on the fitness report to be reasonable because the Board explicitly determined\n\nthat the plaintiff was working within the scope of his duties when performing the administrative\n\ntasks and the Board\u2019s finding was consistent with the written descriptions of a Hospital\n\nCorpsman\u2019s duties. See id. at *7\u2013*8. The court held that it should defer to the Board\u2019s definition\n\nof a service member\u2019s duties and its \u201cexpress conclusion\u2014supported by the plain text of Navy\n\nregulations\u2014that [the plaintiff\u2019s] administrative activities were within the scope of his duties.\u201d Id.\n\nat *8 (citing Wronke, 787 F.2d at 1576). O\u2019Hare distinguished the facts of Nyan, finding that\n\nunlike in the IPEB decision at issue in Nyan, the BCNR made explicit findings about the types of\n\nduties the plaintiff in O\u2019Hare was expected to perform as a Hospital Corpsman, including the\n\nadministrative work he was successfully performing immediately prior to his separation. See id.\n\n          Here, Plaintiff\u2019s penultimate performance evaluation\u2014covering the period of March 2013\n\nto May 2013\u2014indicates that Plaintiff was at the ND2 rating primarily performing the duties of a\n\nSecond Class Navy Diver, which included the \u201coperation, maintenance, and repair of diving life\n\nsupport equipment.\u201d See AR 156. It also noted that he performed collateral duties including,\n\namong others, funeral honors. Id. According to the evaluation, Plaintiff met the standards in all\n\ncategories of performance traits except for \u201cmilitary bearing/character,\u201d in which he fell below\n\nstandards due to his drunken operation of a vehicle. Id. at 157. The evaluation did not include\n\ncomments on performance providing any further detail about Plaintiff\u2019s duties during this period.\n\nSee id.\n\n          Plaintiff\u2019s final evaluation\u2014covering the period of May 2013 to December 2013\u2014reflects\n\nthat Plaintiff was at the ND3 rating primarily performing the duties of a Maintenance Technician-\n\n4 assigned to the Hull Division of the Small Craft Repair Department. Id. at 154. It also indicates\n\nthat Plaintiff was on temporary duty assignment to Ft. Belvoir Community Hospital from\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fSeptember 24, 2013, to December 13, 2013, which overlaps with the period he received in-patient\n\ntreatment for depression and alcohol disorder. Id.; see id. at 67. Again, according to the\n\nevaluation, Plaintiff met the standards in all categories of performance traits except for \u201cmilitary\n\nbearing/character,\u201d in which he was graded as \u201cprogressing.\u201d See id. at 154\u201355. Like the previous\n\nevaluation, no further information about his duties during this period was provided in the comment\n\nsection. See id. at 155.\n\n       The Board characterized these last two performance evaluations as \u201cobjective evidence,\u201d\n\npersuading it that Plaintiff could perform the duties of his office, grade, rank, or rating despite the\n\nexistence of Plaintiff\u2019s diagnosed disabilities. Id. at 6. The Board found \u201c[m]ost important[]\u201d the\n\nfact that Plaintiff\u2019s final evaluation occurred after the DHA diagnosed Plaintiff with, inter alia,\n\nneurocognitive deficits in its December 9, 2013 report and emphasized that fact as \u201cconvincing\n\nevidence\u201d that Plaintiff was fit to perform his duties. See id. It, however, made no explicit or\n\nimplicit finding regarding what duties a Second Class Navy Diver at the E4 grade is reasonably\n\nexpected to perform or finding that the duties Plaintiff was performing during the periods covered\n\nby the two evaluation reports included such duties. See id. at 5\u20137.\n\n       Moreover, the performance evaluations do not provide much information at all about the\n\nspecific duties Plaintiff was performing at the Naval Academy from March to December 2013.\n\nUnlike all the other evaluations in the record, his final two evaluations lack explanatory comments\n\nabout his duties. Compare id. at 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, with id. at 155, 157. And of course,\n\nPlaintiff was not performing any duties from September 24 to December 13, 2013, while he was\n\nbeing treated at Ft. Belvoir Community Hospital. See id. at 154.\n\n       Citing a Navy Diver rating description provided in MILPERSMAN 1220-100, ch. 43 (May\n\n30, 2013), Plaintiff contends the \u201ccommon duties of a Navy diver include descending into the\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\focean at any depth\u201d and working in, among other conditions, \u201chostile environments that include\n\ncold muddy water where tasks can be completed only by feel.\u201d 7 ECF No. 10 at 16 (citing ECF\n\nNo. 10-1 at 311). Plaintiff asserts that his duties during his last two evaluation periods while\n\nstationed at the Naval Academy involved servicing diving equipment and performing funeral\n\nhonors and, therefore, do not reliably demonstrate that he could perform the duties reasonably\n\nexpected of a Second Class Navy Diver. See id. Plaintiff argues that the Board erred by focusing\n\non these final evaluations, where an examination of his performance evaluations pre-dating his\n\nassignment to the Naval Academy evidenced the types of duties he was reasonably expected to\n\nperform. Id. These previous evaluations depict Plaintiff as a skilled and tireless diver, valuably\n\ncontributing to salvage diving operations and joint naval exercises. See, e.g., AR 161, 165.\n\n       To be sure, Plaintiff\u2019s prior performance evaluations reflect that he operated and\n\nmaintained diving equipment as part of his primary duties as a Second Class Diver prior to his\n\nNaval Academy assignment. See, e.g., id. at 161, 163, 166. He continued to perform those duties\n\nafter transferring to the Naval Academy and before his instances of misconduct. See id. at 158,\n\n159. Like Nyan, however, the record before the BCNR showed that as a Second Class Navy Diver\n\nPlaintiff was expected to perform and did perform a broader range of duties. See id. at 158\u201367.\n\nBecause \u201cthe question is not whether [Plaintiff] was disabled from performing any and all work\n\nthat a [Navy Diver] might be assigned to perform,\u201d that he was maintaining diving equipment\n\nduring the periods covered by the final evaluations does not necessarily equate to a finding that he\n\nwas fit to perform work that a member in his office, grade, rank, or rating would \u201creasonably be\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           Plaintiff attached a number of documents as an appendix to his motion, primarily\nincluding official Navy and Department of Defense regulations and other policies. See generally\nECF No. 10-1. Defendant does not dispute that the Court may consider these policy documents in\nresolving the parties\u2019 motions. ECF No. 11 at 15 n.3.\n                                                20\n\fexpected to perform.\u201d 8 Nyan, 153 Fed. Cl. at 243 (quoting SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3),\n\n\u00b6 3301).\n\n       The deficiencies in the Board\u2019s consideration of Plaintiff\u2019s common military tasks are more\n\npronounced given the extra importance it accorded to his final performance evaluation. See AR 6.\n\nThe Board\u2019s decision did not mention that this evaluation covered a period in which Plaintiff was\n\nprimarily performing the duties of a maintenance technician\u2014not a Second Class Navy Diver. See\n\nid. at 5\u20137. Nor did the decision acknowledge that during the period covered by this evaluation\n\nPlaintiff lost his Second Class Navy Diver classification, see id., which may be why his primary\n\nduty abbreviator changed to maintenance technician, see id. at 154. 9 Because the Board\u2019s decision\n\nfailed to explain the connection between the duties performed by a maintenance technician and the\n\nduties that a Second Class Navy Diver at the E4 grade may reasonably be expected to perform, the\n\nCourt is left to guess whether the Board\u2019s fitness determination properly took these facts into\n\nconsideration. See Nyan, 153 Fed. Cl. at 245; see also Joslyn v. United States, 110 Fed. Cl. 372,\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          Defendant argues that, in addition to maintaining equipment, Plaintiff actually dove while\non assignment at the Naval Academy, showing that he was physically able to dive despite his\nconditions. ECF No. 11 at 25. The performance evaluation on which Defendant relies does not\nclearly establish this fact. Under the topic \u201cMotivated Diver,\u201d the evaluation comments that he\n\u201c[p]layed an essential role in salvage and recovery of eight Yard Patrol craft rub rails from Naval\nSupport Activity, Annapolis basin, saving the Navy $8,000 in replacement costs.\u201d AR 159. It\ndoes not explain what \u201crole\u201d he played. The other activities described under this topic refer to\nqualifications for watchstanding duties, which to the Court\u2019s understanding do not include diving.\nSee id. The topic heading may, therefore, simply refer to his rating and not the performance of\ndiving duties during the evaluation period. Moreover, as Plaintiff notes, even if Plaintiff were\nphysically able to dive, it does not necessarily mean he was medically able to dive. See ECF No.\n12 at 12.\n       9\n           Although the Navy removed his classification on September 24, 2013, see AR 155,\nPlaintiff was discharged with the rating of Third Class Navy Diver, see id. at 399. Therefore, the\npoint remains the same; the record is devoid of any indication that Plaintiff\u2019s capacity to\nsuccessfully perform the duties of a maintenance technician translates to a finding that he could\nsuccessfully perform the duties of a Navy Diver, regardless of the specific classification.\n                                                21\n\f389 (2013) (observing the substantial evidence standard as requiring review of whether military\n\ndisability evaluation board\u2019s decision took into consideration relevant factors).\n\n       That is not to say that the performance evaluations necessarily preclude a fitness\n\ndetermination in this case. It may be possible, for example, that the duties of a maintenance\n\ntechnician sufficiently overlap with the duties of a Navy Diver, making the final performance\n\nevaluation pertinent evidence in assessing Plaintiff\u2019s fitness. See ECF No. 10-1 at 311\u201312\n\n(showing that Navy Divers may be assigned to ship repair units and that civilian occupations\n\nequivalent to the Navy Diver job include \u201cmaintenance and repair workers\u201d). Because this Court\n\ndefers to the BCNR on the substantive question of a service member\u2019s fitness, remand would be\n\nappropriate for the BCNR in the first instance to reconsider Plaintiff\u2019s performance evaluation\n\nreports and further explain its determination with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s common military tasks. See\n\nNyan, 154 Fed. Cl. at 467. As explained below, however, remand is unnecessary since the Board\u2019s\n\ndecision can be upheld on an independent, alternative ground.\n\n       2.      Other Considerations for Determining Reasonable Performance of Duties\n\n       Plaintiff contends that the Board also failed to consider other criteria of SECNAVINST\n\n1850.4E, including Plaintiff\u2019s deployability and the risk Plaintiff\u2019s impairments may have posed\n\nto himself and other service members, as well as the special medical requirements for divers as set\n\nforth in the MANMED. ECF No. 10 at 17\u201318, 19\u201320. In response, Defendant primarily asserts\n\nthat Plaintiff has waived these arguments because he \u201cdid not argue to the BCNR that any\n\ndeployment restrictions, risk to others, or MANMED standards for divers made him physically\n\nunfit for duty.\u201d ECF No. 11 at 26; see ECF No. 13 at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f       In addition to common military tasks, SECNAVINST 1850.4E mandates that a fitness\n\ndetermination \u201cincludes consideration of,\u201d as relevant here, deployability 10 and special\n\nqualifications. SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3304; see id. \u00b6 3307 (identifying special\n\nqualifications to include \u201cdiving qualifications\u201d). MANMED identifies the types of medical\n\nconditions that would cause a service member to lose his or her diving qualifications and is\n\ntherefore relevant to the special-qualifications inquiry mandated by SECNAVINST 1850.4E. See\n\nECF No. 10-1 at 305\u201310. The instruction expressly states that the considerations of deployability\n\nand special qualifications are not to be used individually as a sole basis for determining a service\n\nmember\u2019s fitness. See SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3307. The instruction, however, does\n\nnot foreclose the possibility that these considerations, when evaluated collectively with the other\n\nidentified considerations (including common military tasks), could have the combined effect of\n\nsupporting a determination of unfitness. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 3304, 3307. Therefore, while they are not\n\nindividually determinative, they are relevant considerations that should be examined when\n\nassessing a service member\u2019s fitness. See id. \u00b6 3304. SECNAVINST 1850.4E also allows for\u2014\n\nbut does not require\u2014the consideration of whether a member\u2019s \u201c[m]edical condition represents a\n\ndecided medical risk to the health of the member or to the welfare of other members were the\n\nmember to continue on active duty or in an Active Reserve status.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3302.b.(1).\n\n       There is no dispute that the BCNR\u2019s decision does not reflect the Board\u2019s consideration of\n\nany of the factors identified by Plaintiff\u2014i.e., deployability, special qualifications, and risk.\n\n\n\n       10\n            \u201cDeployable\u201d is defined as a \u201cdetermination that the member is free of a medical\ncondition(s) that prevents positioning the member individually or as part of a unit, with or without\nprior notification, to [a] location outside the [c]ontinental United States for an unspecified period\nof time.\u201d SECNAVIST 1850.4E, encl. (2), \u00b6 2019. \u201cNondeployability does not necessarily equate\nto Unfitness,\u201d id., and the \u201c[i]nability to perform the duties of [the member\u2019s] office, grade, rank,\nor rating in every geographic location and under every conceivable circumstance will not be the\nsole basis for a finding of Unfit,\u201d id., encl. (3), \u00b6 3304.a.(3).\n                                                 23\n\fRather, Defendant argues, primarily relying on two cases, that Plaintiff waived these arguments\n\nby raising them for the first time in the proceedings before this Court. See ECF No. 13 at 11 (citing\n\nMetz and Rock v. United States, 112 Fed. Cl. 113 (2013)). Metz and Rock are distinguishable.\n\nBoth cases involved the waiver of new arguments that could have appropriately been raised during\n\nprior agency proceedings and that, absent being raised, were not arguments that the agency would\n\notherwise reasonably be expected to address. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999 (holding the plaintiff\n\nwaived an ineffective assistance of counsel argument where he did not raise such claim in his\n\npetition to a corrections board for review of his voluntary discharge from the Air Force); Rock,\n\n112 Fed. Cl. at 128 (holding that the plaintiff waived certain arguments that could have been raised\n\nin his administrative appeal of a formal PEB decision assigning him a 20 percent total disability\n\nrating and removing him from the temporary disability retired list).\n\n       Here, unlike in Metz, Plaintiff is not raising \u201cnew\u201d arguments that were not before the\n\nBCNR. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999. The issue before the BCNR was Plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfitness,\n\nand Plaintiff argues that the Board failed to consider relevant criteria and factors that\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E required it to consider when evaluating his claim. See ECF No. 10 at 17\u2013\n\n20. Unlike in Rock, where the plaintiff administratively appealed his fitness determination before\n\nseeking judicial review of the denial of his appeal, Plaintiff was not referred for a formal PEB and\n\nthus this Court is reviewing the Board\u2019s determination in the first instance of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness.\n\nSee Rock, 112 Fed. Cl. at 127\u201328. The nature of Plaintiff\u2019s argument is predicated on the Board\n\nfirst adjudicating his claim because it was only after the Board issued the decision that Plaintiff\n\nbecame aware of and could object to the deficiencies in its application of SECNAVINST 1850.4E.\n\n       Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that the BCNR need not apply aspects of\n\na directly relevant, binding Navy instruction simply because a service member did not specifically\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fidentify the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs applicable to his case. Just as our legal system is\n\nfounded on the notion that individuals interacting with the Government are presumed to know the\n\nlaw, Hermes Consol., Inc. v. United States, 58 Fed. Cl. 409, 416 (2003), rev\u2019d on other grounds\n\nsub nom. Tesoro Hawaii Corp. v. United States, 405 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2005), so too should we\n\nexpect that an administrative body charged with determining the fitness of a service member\n\nknows the legal standard to be applied. There are no meaningful fairness concerns that would\n\nweigh in favor of a waiver finding. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999. Accordingly, the Court finds that\n\nPlaintiff did not waive these arguments by not specifically raising them before the Board.\n\n       Turning to the merits, neither the Board\u2019s determination, nor the advisory opinion on which\n\nit relied, demonstrate any consideration of whether Plaintiff\u2019s medical conditions affected his\n\ndeployability or special qualifications as a Navy Diver. 11 See AR 5\u20137, 127\u201331. As Plaintiff notes,\n\nDepartment of Defense Instruction (\u201cDoDI\u201d) 6490.07 provides that, in general, service members\n\nwith certain medical conditions \u201cshall not deploy unless a waiver is granted.\u201d ECF No. 10-1 at\n\n325 (Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD Civilian\n\nEmployees, DoDI 6490.07, encl. (3) (Feb. 5, 2010)); see ECF No. 10 at 17. This includes, among\n\nothers, conditions that require frequent clinical visits and certain mental health disorders. ECF\n\n\n\n       11\n              Indeed, the Board\u2019s decision does not specifically identify at all the regulatory\nprovisions or other policies that it considered. See AR 5 (stating only that \u201c[d]ocumentary material\nconsidered by the Board consisted of . . . applicable statutes, regulations and policies\u201d); see id. at\n127 (broadly listing as a reference to the CORB advisory opinion the \u201cSECNAVINST 1850.4\nseries\u201d). Nor did Defendant include any regulatory or policy materials in the administrative record,\ndespite the express statement that such documents were reviewed and considered by the Board.\nMarathon Oil Co. v. United States, 17 Cl. Ct. 116, 121 (1989) (\u201c[T]he complete administrative\nrecord . . . consist[s] of \u2018all the documents and materials that were directly or indirectly considered\nby the decision-makers at the time the decisions were rendered.\u2019\u201d (quoting Tenneco Oil Co. v.\nDep\u2019t of Energy, 475 F. Supp. 299 (D. Del. 1979))). It does not escape the Court\u2019s notice that the\nrecord is conspicuously vague as to the regulatory provisions and policies the Board applied, which\nfrustrates the Court\u2019s ability to evaluate whether the Board\u2019s decision-making process followed\nNavy procedures.\n                                                  25\n\fNo. 10-1 at 325, 327. The DHA report demonstrates that shortly before his discharge Plaintiff had\n\npsychological diagnoses of major depressive order and cognitive disorder and suffered from\n\nneurocognitive deficits that \u201crequire[d] ongoing and persistent treatment,\u201d including \u201cbehavioral\n\nhealth, occupational therapy, [and] vocational therapy.\u201d See AR 35.\n\n       Additionally, Plaintiff notes that the MANMED provisions applicable to Navy Divers\n\ndisqualify from diving duty (absent a waiver): service members who have suffered decompression\n\nsickness and are experiencing neurological symptoms; members who have certain psychiatric\n\ndiagnoses; or members who have a diagnosis of alcohol dependency, alcohol abuse, or alcohol\n\nincident and have not completed required treatment. See ECF No. 10-1 at 308\u201309; ECF No. 10 at\n\n19\u201320. Evidence in the administrative record shows Plaintiff has a history of type 2 decompression\n\nsickness, neurocognitive issues, Axis I and II psychiatric diagnoses, and alcohol use disorder. See\n\nAR 35, 39, 67, 78, 219; see also id. at 452 (noting that Plaintiff\u2019s diagnoses \u201caffect[ed] his capacity\n\nto continue diving\u201d).\n\n       Whether and how these considerations would have affected Plaintiff\u2019s fitness\n\ndetermination is not a matter within this Court\u2019s judicial province. Heisig, 719 F.2d at 1156. The\n\nCourt, however, is empowered to review whether the BCNR \u201centirely failed to consider\u201d important\n\nfactors in reaching its determination. State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; see Joslyn, 110 Fed. Cl. at 389.\n\nThe Court finds that the Board failed to take into account certain factors that it should have\n\nconsidered pursuant to SECNAVINST 1850.4E in determining that Plaintiff could reasonably\n\nperform his duties and that, as shown by evidence in the record, were relevant to his case. Remand\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fwould therefore be appropriate for the Board to reconsider its decision in light of these additional\n\nconsiderations, see Nyan, 154 Fed. Cl. at 467, but is ultimately unnecessary as explained below. 12\n\nC.     The BCNR\u2019s Determination That Plaintiff\u2019s Separation for Misconduct Took\n       Precedence Was Not Arbitrary and Capricious or Contrary to Law.\n\n       Even though the BCNR\u2019s fitness determination was deficient for the reasons stated above,\n\nthe shortcomings in its decision-making were not harmful or prejudicial. See Christian v. United\n\nStates, 337 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (\u201cTo recover back pay, it is not enough for the\n\nplaintiff to show merely that an error or injustice was committed in the administrative process,\u201d\n\nhe must demonstrate \u201cthat the defect substantially affected the decision to separate him or relieve\n\nhim from active duty . . . .\u201d (quoting Hary v. United States, 618 F.2d 704, 707 (Ct. Cl. 1980))); see\n\nalso Wagner v. United States, 365 F.3d 1358, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2004). That is because the BCNR\n\nfound, regardless of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness or unfitness, that his \u201cmisconduct processing would have\n\ntaken precedence\u201d over disability processing. AR 6; see Fogo De Chao (Holdings), Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 769 F.3d 1127, 1149 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that where an agency\n\ndecision is based on multiple independent grounds a court can affirm the agency on APA review\n\n\u201cso long as any one of the grounds is valid\u201d); see also Holmes v. United States, 98 Fed. Cl. 767,\n\n784\u201385 (2011) (upholding BCNR decision on one of its stated grounds where other stated ground\n\n\n\n\n       12\n             The Court does not find error in the Board failing to explicitly consider whether\nPlaintiff\u2019s impairments posed a risk to himself or others. SECNAVINST 1850.4E states that a\nfitness determination \u201cmay\u201d include an assessment of the risk posed to the welfare of the member,\nas well as other members due to the retention of a service member with a medical condition.\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3302.b. Thus, unlike deployability and special qualifications,\nthe permissive language of the instruction leaves the performance of this risk assessment and its\ninclusion in a determination of a service member\u2019s fitness at the discretion of the relevant naval\nauthorities charged with the responsibility of making the determination. See id. Although not\nrequired, however, the facts of some cases may warrant inclusion of the risk consideration,\nespecially in cases of members who, like Navy Divers, perform particularly hazardous duties.\n                                                 27\n\fwas erroneous). The BCNR\u2019s decision on that point was neither arbitrary and capricious, nor\n\ncontrary to law.\n\n       The Navy disability regulation in effect at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation mandated that\n\n\u201c[p]rocessing for punitive discharge and processing for administrative discharge for misconduct\n\ntakes precedence over processing for disability.\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (1), \u00b6 1002.b; see\n\nid., encl. (3), \u00b6 3203.f.(6) (\u201cThe PEB will reject all cases in which the member is being processed\n\nfor misconduct which could result in the member receiving either a punitive or administrative\n\ndischarge due to that misconduct.\u201d); see also Malcolm v. United States, 752 F. App\u2019x 973, 977 n.2\n\n(Fed. Cir. 2018) (acknowledging that Navy disability regulations mandate misconduct processing\n\ntakes precedence over disability processing). 13 Plaintiff acknowledges the Board\u2019s finding that\n\nmisconduct processing takes precedence over referrals to the DES system as \u201ca correct statement\n\nof Navy policy in effect at the time of [Plaintiff\u2019s] separation.\u201d ECF No. 10 at 20. In that vein,\n\nPlaintiff concedes that the Board \u201cadequately explained why there was no error in the initial denial\n\nof disability retirement.\u201d Id. at 21.\n\n       Plaintiff, however, relies on a June 1, 2016 Memorandum from the Secretary of the Navy\n\n(\u201cDual Processing Memorandum\u201d) to argue that the Secretary has changed this policy and that the\n\nchange should have prompted the BCNR to grant Plaintiff\u2019s request of disability retirement. See\n\nid.; see also ECF No. 10-1 at 313\u201314 (Dual Processing Memorandum). The Dual Processing\n\n\n\n\n       13\n           The Federal Circuit in Malcom noted that, despite the mandate, a plaintiff may be able\nto establish eligibility for benefits under SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3414.b, which\nprohibits holding a service member responsible for his or her acts of misconduct if mental disease\nor defect caused the service member to be unable to appreciate the nature and quality of the\nwrongfulness of the acts. 752 F. App\u2019x at 977 n.2. Here, the Board \u201cfound no evidence that\nsupported an argument [Plaintiff was] not criminally responsible for [his] misconduct and noted\nthat there was no evidence presented in [his] civilian proceedings to indicate any mental\nincompetence.\u201d AR 6. Plaintiff does not challenge that finding in this action.\n                                                28\n\fMemorandum allows service members, who have a ratable condition and are being processed for\n\nany type of involuntary administrative separation, to be referred to the DES. ECF No. 10-1 at 313.\n\nThe immediate effect of the Dual Processing Memorandum marked a noticeable shift in policy\n\nfrom the prior preclusion of such dual processing. See, e.g., SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\n\n3203.f.(6). Plaintiff argues that the Board\u2019s failure to consider the impact of the Dual Processing\n\nMemorandum on Plaintiff\u2019s case renders the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious and in\n\nviolation of the BCNR\u2019s mandate to correct an injustice in a member\u2019s naval records. ECF No.\n\n10 at 21.\n\n       This    argument     suffers    from    both     procedural    and    substantive    flaws.\n\nFirst, as Defendant correctly notes, Plaintiff never raised an argument to the Board based on the\n\nexistence of the Dual Processing Memorandum and its purported application to Plaintiff\u2019s case.\n\nSee ECF No. 11 at 29; see also AR 12\u201322. He could have. The change in policy occurred in June\n\n2016 and was publicized by July 2016, at the latest, several months before Plaintiff submitted his\n\napplication to the Board. See ECF No. 10-1 at 313, 315; see also AR 10. Although Plaintiff\n\ncontends that, \u201c[i]n his response to the medical advisor\u2019s opinion, he specifically argued that his\n\ndisabilities should take precedence over his misconduct separation,\u201d that argument was premised\n\non his interpretation of \u00b6\u00b6 3106 and 3202.b of the applicable instruction (SECNAVINST 1850.4E),\n\nnot any new or changed policy. ECF No. 12 at 13\u201314 (citing AR 17); see AR 17.\n\n       As discussed above, the well-settled principle that arguments not raised before an\n\nadministrative body cannot be first raised on judicial review applies equally to the review of\n\nmilitary correction board decisions. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999; United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck\n\nLines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952) (\u201cSimple fairness to those who are engaged in the tasks of\n\nadministration, and to litigants, requires as a general rule that courts should not topple over\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fadministrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against\n\nobjection made at the time appropriate under its practice.\u201d). The \u201cstandard for assessing whether\n\nan issue was adequately raised before the administrative agency is that \u2018the issue must be raised\n\nwith sufficient specificity and clarity that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in\n\nsufficient time that the agency can do so.\u2019\u201d Conant v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 255 F.3d 1371, 1375\n\n(Fed. Cir. 2001) (quoting Wallace v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).\n\n       Here, the record shows that an argument based on the Dual Processing Memorandum was\n\nnot adequately raised to the BCNR. At best, Plaintiff\u2019s response to the CORB advisory opinion\n\nbroached the subject of whether his misconduct should have precluded him from being referred to\n\nthe PEB based on his disabilities, but it did not specifically or clearly argue that such question\n\nshould be answered by application of a change in policy. Indeed, he supported the argument based\n\non the application of the version of SECNAVINST 1850.4E in effect at the time, which expressly\n\nprecluded dual processing. See AR 17. It cannot therefore be said that the BCNR should have\n\nbeen aware that it must decide the issue of whether the Dual Processing Memorandum applied to\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s case. 14 See Conant, 255 F.3d at 1375. Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendant\n\nand finds Plaintiff has waived his argument premised on the Dual Processing Memorandum.\n\n       Second, the policy is facially inapplicable to Plaintiff because it contemplates application\n\nto \u201cmembers being processed for any type of involuntary [administrative separation].\u201d ECF No.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           For these reasons, the waiver analysis related to the Dual Processing Memorandum leads\nto a different conclusion than the analysis of Plaintiff\u2019s arguments regarding SECNAVINST\n1850.4E considerations. The memorandum is not incorporated in any fashion in the Navy\u2019s\ndisability regulation in effect at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation; indeed, it is contrary to it.\nPlaintiff\u2019s argument that the Dual Processing Memorandum applies retroactively to supplant the\npolicy that was applicable to his separation is a \u201cnew\u201d argument that should have first been raised\nto the BCNR to afford the Board an opportunity to evaluate the argument\u2019s merits. See L.A. Tucker\nTruck Lines, 344 U.S. at 37.\n                                                  30\n\f10-1 at 313 (emphasis added). The language of the Dual Processing Memorandum indicates an\n\nimmediate and prospective effect rather than any retroactive application. As the Supreme Court\n\nhas instructed, \u201c[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law. . . . [A]nd administrative rules will not be\n\nconstrued to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\u201d            Bowen v.\n\nGeorgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988) (citing Greene v. United States, 376 U.S. 149,\n\n160 (1964)).\n\n        Plaintiff argues that an article from \u201cAll Hands\u201d supports retroactive application of the\n\nchange in policy set forth in the Dual Processing Memorandum. ECF No. 10 at 21. The article\n\nstates that \u201c[a]ny service member previously separated under similar circumstances may petition\n\nto have their discharge reviewed through either the discharge review board or Board for Correction\n\nof Naval Records.\u201d ECF No. 10-1 at 315. There is no information in the record regarding the\n\nprovenance of the article, except what is obvious from the printout submitted by Plaintiff. See id.\n\n(indicating that the article was published by Defense Media Activity-Navy Production and written\n\nby a petty officer second class). At the very least, it does not appear to be an official statement of\n\nthe Office of the Secretary of the Navy, and thus has no binding effect. See Hamlet v. United\n\nStates, 63 F.3d 1097, 1103 (Fed. Cir. 1995); see also Dunphy v. United States, 208 Ct. Cl. 986,\n\n989 (1975) (rejecting plaintiff\u2019s argument that an article in the Navy publication \u201cAll Hands\u201d binds\n\nthe Secretary of the Navy because the United States is not \u201cbound by the unauthorized acts of its\n\nagents\u201d) (unpublished). Nor is it persuasive evidence that the Dual Processing Memorandum can\n\nbe interpreted to apply retroactively. ECF No. 10-1 at 315. The article characterizes the\n\nmemorandum as being \u201c[e]ffective immediately.\u201d Id. Its only reference to similarly situated\n\nservice members who were previously separated (other than an explanation in bullet point number\n\none of how the prior policy worked) states that such members may seek to have their discharges\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fadministratively reviewed. Id. It does not make any representation that the Secretary or the review\n\nboards had determined that the Dual Processing Memorandum would be applied to members\n\nseeking such review. See id.\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds no error in the Board\u2019s denial of Plaintiff\u2019s application based\n\non its application of the Navy instruction in effect at the time of his separation, which undisputedly\n\nmade him ineligible for disability processing due to the precedence of his misconduct processing.\n\nBecause the BCNR\u2019s decision can be upheld on that ground, any error in the Board\u2019s decision-\n\nmaking as to its fitness determination was harmless.\n\nD.     The BCNR\u2019s Finding of No Error or Injustice Warranting a Correction to Plaintiff\u2019s\n       Record Was Not Arbitrary and Capricious and Did Not Violate Plaintiff\u2019s Due\n       Process Rights.\n\n       Plaintiff contends that the Board did not adequately explain why, in light of the NDRB\u2019s\n\ndecision, there was no error or injustice in denying Plaintiff disability retirement. ECF No. 10 at\n\n21. According to Plaintiff, the Board should have viewed the NDRB\u2019s decision \u201cthrough the lens\n\nof [c]onstitutional due process requirements.\u201d Id. at 22. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that it was\n\nerroneous and unjust for the Board to rely on Plaintiff\u2019s misconduct processing to deny him\n\ndisability retirement when the NDRB determined that Plaintiff\u2019s medical conditions (related to his\n\nduties as a Navy diver) contributed to his misconduct and thus justified upgrading his discharge\n\ncharacterization and changing his discharge narrative. Id. Defendant argues that Plaintiff\u2019s case\n\ninvolves no due process violation and that the Board adequately considered and rationally\n\nexplained why the NDRB\u2019s decision supported the denial of Plaintiff\u2019s application. See ECF No.\n\n11 at 30\u201331; ECF No. 13 at 15\u201316.\n\n       The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits a person from being \u201cdeprived\n\nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. \u201cDue Process . .\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f. requires specific notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard prior to governmental decisions\n\ndepriving individuals of liberty or property interests.\u201d In re Bailey, 182 F.3d 860, 871 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1999) (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 348 (1976)); see Cushman v. Shinseki, 576 F.3d\n\n1290, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\n       It is well established that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over claims alleging\n\nviolations of the Due Process Clause because such clause is not a money-mandating provision.\n\nSee, e.g., LeBlanc v. United States, 50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1995); James v. Caldera, 159\n\nF.3d 573, 581 (Fed. Cir. 1998). When, however, a constitutional issue arises not as a standalone\n\nclaim but as a factor to a claim of wrongful discharge of a service member, the Court may properly\n\nexercise jurisdiction. See Holley v. United States, 124 F.3d 1462, 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe\n\npresence of a constitutional issue does not erase the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims\n\nbased on a properly brought claim under the Tucker Act, or bar the court from considering the\n\nconstitutional issue in the course of determining whether the discharge was wrongful.\u201d). Here,\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s allegations fall into the latter category. Therefore, the Court may properly consider any\n\nalleged due process violations as part of its broader inquiry into the propriety of the BCNR\u2019s\n\ndecision-making process. See id.\n\n       \u201cTo raise a due process question, the claimant must demonstrate a property interest entitled\n\nto such protections.\u201d Cushman, 576 F.3d at 1296 (citing Richard v. West, 161 F.3d 719, 723 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1998)); see Stone v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\u201cTo have\n\na property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for\n\nit. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim\n\nof entitlement to it.\u201d (quoting Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972))).\n\nDefendant argues that Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that his separation amounted to a deprivation\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fof a property interest triggering due process protections. ECF No. 13 at 15. Instead, as Defendant\n\nasserts, service members possess no right to remain on active duty. See id. (citing, inter alia, Deese\n\nv. Esper, 483 F. Supp. 3d 290, 315 (D. Md. 2020) (\u201cMilitary service members do not have a\n\nproperty interest in their term of enlistment, attendance in military service academies, command\n\nposition, or officer status.\u201d); Paskert v. United States, 20 Cl. Ct. 65, 77 (1990) (\u201cService members\n\nhave no constitutional rights to remain on active duty, and their rights are defined by the applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations.\u201d)). Defendant is correct. \u201cIt is well settled . . . that a service member\u2019s\n\nrights in matters related to pay, allowance, promotion, and demotion are grounded solely on\n\nstatutes and regulations.\u201d Crispino v. United States, 3 Cl. Ct. 306, 313 (1983) (emphasis added)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n        Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserted at oral argument that Cushman held that entitlement to military\n\ndisability benefits is a protectable property interest. Cushman, however, involved the property\n\ninterest of a veteran-applicant for service-connected disability benefits. See 576 F.3d at 1297\u201398.\n\nMilitary disability retirement benefits and veteran disability benefits are derived from wholly\n\ndistinct statutory schemes. See Russell v. United States, 102 Fed. Cl. 9, 17 (2011). This Court\n\nwill not find that same property interest to include military disability benefits in light of established\n\nprecedent. See, e.g., Paskert, 20 Cl. Ct. at 77 (noting military regulations \u201cwere designed\n\nspecifically to give members of the military a useable administrative process by which to present\n\ntheir claims without the entanglements of an entire due process structure\u201d). Accordingly, Plaintiff\n\ncannot claim the Board\u2019s decision violated his due process rights because Plaintiff lacked a\n\nrecognized property interest in the first instance. See id.\n\n        Moreover, it is clear the Board considered the NDRB\u2019s decision and rationally explained\n\nits effect on the Board\u2019s determination. The BCNR stated its agreement with the NDRB\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                   34\n\fconclusion that Plaintiff was \u201cproperly processed and discharged . . . for misconduct\u201d at the time\n\nof his separation. AR 6; see id. at 139 (explaining the NDRB\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s discharge\n\n\u201cwas proper and equitable at the time of discharge\u201d). Just as the NDRB, the Board also found no\n\nevidence to suggest that Plaintiff was not criminally responsible for his misconduct or was\n\nmentally incompetent. Id. at 6; see id. at 138 (explaining the NDRB\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nmisconduct stemmed from \u201cconscious decisions that violate the tenants of honorable and faithful\n\nservice\u201d). Based on these findings, the Board concluded that the misconduct-precedence policy\n\nproperly applied to Plaintiff and, as a result, he was ineligible for disability retirement. Id. at 6.\n\n        Such findings are not inconsistent with, nor do they deprive Plaintiff of the benefit of, the\n\nNDRB\u2019s decision to change his discharge characterization and narrative reason. Although the\n\nBCNR and the NDRB are both naval administrative bodies responsible for reviewing Navy\n\ndischarge or dismissal actions, they do not operate under equivalent mandates. See Vietnam\n\nVeterans of Am. v. Sec\u2019y of Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The NDRB, consisting of\n\nfive Navy officers, reviews discharge actions \u201cto examine the propriety and equity of the\n\napplicant\u2019s discharge\u201d and has the authority to reclassify a discharge where necessary. Lefrancois\n\nv. Mabus, 910 F. Supp. 2d 12, 15 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting SECNAVINST 5420.174D, encl. (5),\n\n\u00a7 501a (Dec. 22, 2004)); see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1553(a), (b)(1). Unlike the NDRB, the BCNR is staffed\n\nby civilians and is charged with \u201ccorrect[ing] any Navy record when \u2018necessary to correct an error\n\nor remove an injustice.\u2019\u201d Vietnam Veterans, 843 F.2d at 531 (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a)). The\n\nBCNR\u2019s mandate \u201chas been viewed as broader than that of the NDRB.\u201d Id. (citing Strang v.\n\nMarsh, 602 F. Supp. 1565, 1570 (D.R.I. 1985)). Accordingly, a decision by the NDRB to afford\n\nrelief based on considerations of equity does not require the Board to find that those same\n\nconsiderations result in error or injustice warranting a correction of records. Indeed, the NDRB\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\ffound no error or inequities with Plaintiff\u2019s discharge at the time. AR 139. Whether post-\n\nseparation circumstances rose to the level of \u201cinjustice\u201d in Plaintiff\u2019s case was a decision within\n\nthe Board\u2019s broad discretion to make. See Murphy v. United States, 993 F.2d 871, 874 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1993) (citing Grieg v. United States, 640 F.2d 1261, 1265 (Ct. Cl. 1981)). Here, the Court finds\n\nnothing arbitrary or capricious about the Board\u2019s consideration or explanation of the NDRB\u2019s\n\ndecision.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the above stated reasons, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record\n\n(ECF No. 9) is hereby DENIED, and Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion for Judgment on the\n\nAdministrative Record (ECF No. 11) is GRANTED.

Additionally, disability retirement is\n\navailable only to members who have either 20 years of service or whose disability is at least 30\n\npercent under the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Schedule for Ratings Disabilities and\n\nwas incurred in, among other circumstances, the line of duty. Id. \u00a7 1201(b)(3). Congress has\n\nauthorized the Secretary concerned to prescribe regulations implementing the statutory provisions\n\ngoverning retirement or separation due to physical disability. Id. \u00a7 1216(a).\n\n        The relevant regulation in Plaintiff\u2019s case is Secretary of the Navy Instruction\n\n(\u201cSECNAVINST\u201d) 1850.4E, which defined the applicable standards and procedures used by the\n\nNavy to adjudicate disability cases at the time of Plaintiff\u2019s separation. Pursuant to the instruction,\n\na Physical Evaluation Board (\u201cPEB\u201d) acts on behalf of the Secretary of the Navy to determine a\n\nmember\u2019s fitness to continue naval service and entitlement to disability benefits. See Department\n\nof Navy (DON) Disability Evaluation Manual, SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (1), \u00b6 1004.a (Apr.\n\n30, 2002) (describing PEB procedures as part of the Navy\u2019s Disability Evaluation System\n\n(\u201cDES\u201d)).      In assessing whether a service member is eligible for disability retirement,\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E provides that:\n\n        The sole standard to be used in making determinations of physical disability as a\n        basis for retirement or separation is unfitness to perform the duties of office, grade,\n        rank or rating because of disease or injury incurred or aggravated while entitled to\n        basic pay. Each case is considered by relating the nature and degree of physical\n        disability of the member to requirements and duties that member may reasonably\n        be expected to perform in his or her office, grade, rank or rating.\n\nId., encl. (3), \u00b6 3301. 2\n\n\n\n\n        2\n           The instruction similarly defines unfitness as an inability to \u201creasonably perform the\nduties of office, grade, rank or rating.\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (2), \u00b6 2085.\n                                                  2\n\f       The instruction provides four considerations for the PEB to assess in determining whether\n\na service member can reasonably perform his or her duties: (1) common military tasks, i.e.,\n\nwhether the member is unable to reasonably perform routine assignments expected of his or her\n\noffice, grade, rank or rating; (2) physical readiness/fitness tests, i.e., whether the member\u2019s\n\ncondition prohibits him or her from taking all or part of physical readiness/fitness tests; (3)\n\ndeployability, i.e., whether the member\u2019s condition prevents him or her from being positioned\n\noutside the continental United States for an unspecified amount of time; and (4) special\n\nqualifications, i.e., whether the member\u2019s condition causes the loss of any specialized\n\nqualifications. Id. \u00b6 3304. Notably, the standards utilized for a disability determination and for\n\nconsidering common military tasks are effectively interchangeable: both assess whether the\n\nmember can reasonably perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating. See id.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 3301, 3302.a, 3304.a.(1). Therefore, a finding that a service member cannot perform his or her\n\ncommon military tasks is dispositive to the ultimate question of the member\u2019s unfitness. By\n\ncontrast, the considerations of deployability, physical fitness test, and special qualifications cannot\n\nbe used individually as the sole basis for a finding of unfitness. See id. \u00b6 3307.\n\n       In addition to the four considerations, the instruction also provides that the PEB may\n\nevaluate other general criteria when determining a member\u2019s unfitness, including, as relevant here,\n\nwhether a member\u2019s condition poses a medical risk to the member (or other members) were the\n\nmember to be retained on active duty and whether the condition imposes unreasonable\n\nrequirements on the military to maintain or protect the member. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3302.b.(1), (2).\n\n       \u201c[I]n assessing service member fitness, including the circumstances of referral [to the\n\nDES],\u201d SECNAVINST 1850.4E instructs the PEB to \u201c[c]onsider all relevant evidence,\u201d id. \u00b6 3303,\n\nand make a finding of fitness or unfitness based on a preponderance of the evidence, id. \u00b6 3306.b.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fThe instruction recognizes that in certain circumstances performance evaluations \u201cmay provide\n\nbetter evidence than a clinical estimate by a physician of the service member\u2019s ability to perform\n\nhis or her duties.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3303.b; see id. \u00b6 3205. It also provides that a member can be determined\n\nfit based on a finding that he or she adequately performed duties until the time of referral for DES\n\nprocessing, even if medical evidence calls into question his or her physical ability to continue to\n\nperform those duties. Id. \u00b6 3303.c.\n\n       Notably, SECNAVINST 1850.4E does not apply to a member who is pending\n\nadministrative discharge for misconduct. See id., encl. (1), \u00b6 1002.b. According to the instruction,\n\n\u201cprocessing for administrative discharge for misconduct takes precedence over processing for\n\ndisability.\u201d Id.\n\n       Although Plaintiff was never referred to the PEB for evaluation before the Navy discharged\n\nhim, the standard and related considerations established in SECNAVINST 1850.4E, as discussed\n\nabove, guide the Court in evaluating the propriety of the BCNR\u2019s decision-making process.

The BCNR Failed to Consider Important Aspects and Relevant Criteria of the\n       Applicable Naval Disability Regulation in Denying Plaintiff Disability Retirement.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that the BCNR\u2019s decision to deny his request for disability retirement was\n\narbitrary and capricious because the Board failed to consider all relevant factors, as set forth in\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E and the Navy\u2019s Manual of the Medical Department (\u201cMANMED\u201d), 6 and\n\nmade factual findings regarding Plaintiff\u2019s fitness not supported by substantial evidence. ECF No.\n\n10 at 15. Defendant disagrees, arguing that the Board\u2019s determination of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness for\n\nduty at the time of his discharge (and thus ineligibility for disability retirement) was supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. ECF No. 11 at 20. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff waived his\n\narguments related to the Board\u2019s failure to consider all relevant factors necessary to resolve his\n\napplication by not raising those arguments directly to the Board. See id. On these issues, Plaintiff\n\nhas the better claim.\n\n       1.      Plaintiff\u2019s Common Military Tasks\n\n       Under SECNAVINST 1850.4E, the determination of a member\u2019s ability to perform his or\n\nher duties (i.e., fitness for duty) should take into consideration the member\u2019s common military\n\ntasks. Plaintiff argues that, in making its finding, the Board failed as a threshold matter to consider\n\n\u201cwhat tasks [Plaintiff] would be reasonably expected to perform as a Navy diver.\u201d ECF No. 10 at\n\n\n\n       6\n           MANMED establishes specialized standards and physical qualifications for diving duty\nthat must be met for continued diving duty service. See ECF No. 10-1 at 305\u201310 (excerpt of\nMANMED, art. 15-102 (Aug. 12, 2005)). These standards include neurological and psychiatric\ncriteria. See id. at 308\u201309.\n                                                  15\n\f16; see Pl.\u2019s Reply at 12\u201313, ECF No. 12. Instead, Plaintiff asserts that the Board improperly\n\nfocused on Plaintiff\u2019s final two performance evaluations, which covered Plaintiff\u2019s assignment to\n\nthe Naval Academy where his duties were not fully reflective of his service as a Navy diver. ECF\n\nNo. 10 at 16. Defendant argues that no Navy regulation requires the BCNR to assess a member\u2019s\n\ncommon military tasks at the \u201cgranular level\u201d that Plaintiff suggests. Def.\u2019s Reply at 9, ECF No.\n\n13. Rather, it contends that the Board\u2019s reliance on Plaintiff\u2019s final performance evaluations to\n\ndetermine whether he could perform the duties of his rating was rational and in accordance with\n\nnaval regulations, and substantially supported its decision. Id.; see ECF No. 11 at 23.\n\n       SECNAVINST 1850.4E does not define the level of detail required by the common-\n\nmilitary-task consideration. However, the overall standard used for determining disability (which\n\nis essentially the same standard for considering common military tasks) shows that a mere review\n\nof whether a member was adequately performing duties\u2014regardless of what those were\u2014\n\nimmediately before separation is not sufficient. The standard requires \u201crelating the nature and\n\ndegree of physical disability of the member to the requirements and duties that member may\n\nreasonably be expected to perform in his or her office, grade, rank or rating.\u201d SECNAVINST\n\n1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3301 (emphasis added). A disability determination must therefore connect\n\nthe review of a member\u2019s performance of duties with a consideration of the duties that are within\n\nthe member\u2019s common military tasks.             Otherwise, as Defendant correctly observes,\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E makes clear that performance evaluations are relevant evidence of the\n\ncapacity of a member suffering from chronic medical impairments to perform duties reasonably\n\nexpected of him or her. See ECF No. 11 at 23; SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\u00b6 3205, 3303.b.\n\n       Recent cases from other judges of this court provide helpful guidance on this very issue.\n\nSee Nyan v.

The\n\ncourt in Nyan held that the IPEB\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence\n\nbecause \u201cthe IPEB did not make any findings regarding what duties a Hospital Corpsman at the\n\nE4 grade is expected to perform.\u201d Id.

Id. at 242\u201343. In rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that\n\nadministrative tasks also fell within the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s rating, the court observed that the\n\nquestion of fitness was not premised on \u201cwhether [the plaintiff] was disabled from performing any\n\nand all work that a Hospital Corpsman might be assigned to perform, but rather whether he was\n\ndisabled from performing work that a Hospital Corpsman at the E4 grade could \u2018reasonably be\n\nexpected to perform.\u2019\u201d Id. at 243 (quoting SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl.

The court\n\nfound evidence in the administrative record demonstrating that, \u201cas a Hospital Corpsman at the E4\n\ngrade, [the plaintiff] was expected to perform a wide range of duties that went beyond sitting at a\n\ndesk doing paperwork.\u201d Id.

See ECF No.\n12 at 12.\n       9\n           Although the Navy removed his classification on September 24, 2013, see AR 155,\nPlaintiff was discharged with the rating of Third Class Navy Diver, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 399</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Therefore, the\npoint remains the same; the record is devoid of any indication that Plaintiff\u2019s capacity to\nsuccessfully perform the duties of a maintenance technician translates to a finding that he could\nsuccessfully perform the duties of a Navy Diver, regardless of the specific classification.\n                                                21\n\f389 (2013) (observing the substantial evidence standard as requiring review of whether military\n\ndisability evaluation board\u2019s decision took into consideration relevant factors).\n\n       That is not to say that the performance evaluations necessarily preclude a fitness\n\ndetermination in this case. It may be possible, for example, that the duties of a maintenance\n\ntechnician sufficiently overlap with the duties of a Navy Diver, making the final performance\n\nevaluation pertinent evidence in assessing Plaintiff\u2019s fitness. See ECF No. 10-1 at 311\u201312\n\n(showing that Navy Divers may be assigned to ship repair units and that civilian occupations\n\nequivalent to the Navy Diver job include \u201cmaintenance and repair workers\u201d).

In response, Defendant primarily asserts\n\nthat Plaintiff has waived these arguments because he \u201cdid not argue to the BCNR that any\n\ndeployment restrictions, risk to others, or MANMED standards for divers made him physically\n\nunfit for duty.\u201d ECF No. 11 at 26; see ECF No. 13 at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f       In addition to common military tasks, SECNAVINST 1850.4E mandates that a fitness\n\ndetermination \u201cincludes consideration of,\u201d as relevant here, deployability 10 and special\n\nqualifications. SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3304; see id. \u00b6 3307 (identifying special\n\nqualifications to include \u201cdiving qualifications\u201d). MANMED identifies the types of medical\n\nconditions that would cause a service member to lose his or her diving qualifications and is\n\ntherefore relevant to the special-qualifications inquiry mandated by SECNAVINST 1850.4E. See\n\nECF No. 10-1 at 305\u201310. The instruction expressly states that the considerations of deployability\n\nand special qualifications are not to be used individually as a sole basis for determining a service\n\nmember\u2019s fitness. See SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6 3307. The instruction, however, does\n\nnot foreclose the possibility that these considerations, when evaluated collectively with the other\n\nidentified considerations (including common military tasks), could have the combined effect of\n\nsupporting a determination of unfitness. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 3304, 3307. Therefore, while they are not\n\nindividually determinative, they are relevant considerations that should be examined when\n\nassessing a service member\u2019s fitness. See id. \u00b6 3304. SECNAVINST 1850.4E also allows for\u2014\n\nbut does not require\u2014the consideration of whether a member\u2019s \u201c[m]edical condition represents a\n\ndecided medical risk to the health of the member or to the welfare of other members were the\n\nmember to continue on active duty or in an Active Reserve status.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3302.b.(1).\n\n       There is no dispute that the BCNR\u2019s decision does not reflect the Board\u2019s consideration of\n\nany of the factors identified by Plaintiff\u2014i.e., deployability, special qualifications, and risk.\n\n\n\n       10\n            \u201cDeployable\u201d is defined as a \u201cdetermination that the member is free of a medical\ncondition(s) that prevents positioning the member individually or as part of a unit, with or without\nprior notification, to [a] location outside the [c]ontinental United States for an unspecified period\nof time.\u201d SECNAVIST 1850.4E, encl. (2), \u00b6 2019. \u201cNondeployability does not necessarily equate\nto Unfitness,\u201d id., and the \u201c[i]nability to perform the duties of [the member\u2019s] office, grade, rank,\nor rating in every geographic location and under every conceivable circumstance will not be the\nsole basis for a finding of Unfit,\u201d id., encl. (3), \u00b6 3304.a.(3).\n                                                 23\n\fRather, Defendant argues, primarily relying on two cases, that Plaintiff waived these arguments\n\nby raising them for the first time in the proceedings before this Court. See ECF No. 13 at 11 (citing\n\nMetz and Rock v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">112 Fed. Cl. 113</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013)). Metz and Rock are distinguishable.\n\nBoth cases involved the waiver of new arguments that could have appropriately been raised during\n\nprior agency proceedings and that, absent being raised, were not arguments that the agency would\n\notherwise reasonably be expected to address. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999 (holding the plaintiff\n\nwaived an ineffective assistance of counsel argument where he did not raise such claim in his\n\npetition to a corrections board for review of his voluntary discharge from the Air Force); Rock,\n\n112 Fed. Cl. at 128 (holding that the plaintiff waived certain arguments that could have been raised\n\nin his administrative appeal of a formal PEB decision assigning him a 20 percent total disability\n\nrating and removing him from the temporary disability retired list).\n\n       Here, unlike in Metz, Plaintiff is not raising \u201cnew\u201d arguments that were not before the\n\nBCNR. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999. The issue before the BCNR was Plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfitness,\n\nand Plaintiff argues that the Board failed to consider relevant criteria and factors that\n\nSECNAVINST 1850.4E required it to consider when evaluating his claim. See ECF No. 10 at 17\u2013\n\n20. Unlike in Rock, where the plaintiff administratively appealed his fitness determination before\n\nseeking judicial review of the denial of his appeal, Plaintiff was not referred for a formal PEB and\n\nthus this Court is reviewing the Board\u2019s determination in the first instance of Plaintiff\u2019s fitness.\n\nSee Rock, 112 Fed. Cl. at 127\u201328. The nature of Plaintiff\u2019s argument is predicated on the Board\n\nfirst adjudicating his claim because it was only after the Board issued the decision that Plaintiff\n\nbecame aware of and could object to the deficiencies in its application of SECNAVINST 1850.4E.\n\n       Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that the BCNR need not apply aspects of\n\na directly relevant, binding Navy instruction simply because a service member did not specifically\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fidentify the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs applicable to his case. Just as our legal system is\n\nfounded on the notion that individuals interacting with the Government are presumed to know the\n\nlaw, Hermes Consol., Inc. v.

There are no meaningful fairness concerns that would\n\nweigh in favor of a waiver finding. See Metz, 466 F.3d at 999. Accordingly, the Court finds that\n\nPlaintiff did not waive these arguments by not specifically raising them before the Board.\n\n       Turning to the merits, neither the Board\u2019s determination, nor the advisory opinion on which\n\nit relied, demonstrate any consideration of whether Plaintiff\u2019s medical conditions affected his\n\ndeployability or special qualifications as a Navy Diver. 11 See AR 5\u20137, 127\u201331. As Plaintiff notes,\n\nDepartment of Defense Instruction (\u201cDoDI\u201d) 6490.07 provides that, in general, service members\n\nwith certain medical conditions \u201cshall not deploy unless a waiver is granted.\u201d ECF No. 10-1 at\n\n325 (Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD Civilian\n\nEmployees, DoDI 6490.07, encl.

ECF\n\n\n\n       11\n              Indeed, the Board\u2019s decision does not specifically identify at all the regulatory\nprovisions or other policies that it considered.

See, e.g., SECNAVINST 1850.4E, encl. (3), \u00b6\n\n3203.f.(6). Plaintiff argues that the Board\u2019s failure to consider the impact of the Dual Processing\n\nMemorandum on Plaintiff\u2019s case renders the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary and capricious and in\n\nviolation of the BCNR\u2019s mandate to correct an injustice in a member\u2019s naval records.

See ECF No. 10-1 at 313, 315; see also AR 10. Although Plaintiff\n\ncontends that, \u201c[i]n his response to the medical advisor\u2019s opinion, he specifically argued that his\n\ndisabilities should take precedence over his misconduct separation,\u201d that argument was premised\n\non his interpretation of \u00b6\u00b6 3106 and 3202.b of the applicable instruction (SECNAVINST 1850.4E),\n\nnot any new or changed policy. ECF No. 12 at 13\u201314 (citing AR 17); see AR 17.\n\n       As discussed above, the well-settled principle that arguments not raised before an\n\nadministrative body cannot be first raised on judicial review applies equally to the review of\n\nmilitary correction board decisions.

When, however, a constitutional issue arises not as a standalone\n\nclaim but as a factor to a claim of wrongful discharge of a service member, the Court may properly\n\nexercise jurisdiction.

Cushman, however, involved the property\n\ninterest of a veteran-applicant for service-connected disability benefits.

See Russell v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">102 Fed. Cl. 9</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (2011). This Court\n\nwill not find that same property interest to include military disability benefits in light of established\n\nprecedent. See, e.g., Paskert, 20 Cl. Ct. at 77 (noting military regulations \u201cwere designed\n\nspecifically to give members of the military a useable administrative process by which to present\n\ntheir claims without the entanglements of an entire due process structure\u201d). Accordingly, Plaintiff\n\ncannot claim the Board\u2019s decision violated his due process rights because Plaintiff lacked a\n\nrecognized property interest in the first instance. See id.\n\n        Moreover, it is clear the Board considered the NDRB\u2019s decision and rationally explained\n\nits effect on the Board\u2019s determination. The BCNR stated its agreement with the NDRB\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                   34\n\fconclusion that Plaintiff was \u201cproperly processed and discharged . . . for misconduct\u201d at the time\n\nof his separation. AR 6; see id. at 139 (explaining the NDRB\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s discharge\n\n\u201cwas proper and equitable at the time of discharge\u201d). Just as the NDRB, the Board also found no\n\nevidence to suggest that Plaintiff was not criminally responsible for his misconduct or was\n\nmentally incompetent. Id. at 6; see id. at 138 (explaining the NDRB\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nmisconduct stemmed from \u201cconscious decisions that violate the tenants of honorable and faithful\n\nservice\u201d). Based on these findings, the Board concluded that the misconduct-precedence policy\n\nproperly applied to Plaintiff and, as a result, he was ineligible for disability retirement. Id. at 6.\n\n        Such findings are not inconsistent with, nor do they deprive Plaintiff of the benefit of, the\n\nNDRB\u2019s decision to change his discharge characterization and narrative reason. Although the\n\nBCNR and the NDRB are both naval administrative bodies responsible for reviewing Navy\n\ndischarge or dismissal actions, they do not operate under equivalent mandates.

The NDRB, consisting of\n\nfive Navy officers, reviews discharge actions \u201cto examine the propriety and equity of the\n\napplicant\u2019s discharge\u201d and has the authority to reclassify a discharge where necessary.

Accordingly, a decision by the NDRB to afford\n\nrelief based on considerations of equity does not require the Board to find that those same\n\nconsiderations result in error or injustice warranting a correction of records. Indeed, the NDRB\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\ffound no error or inequities with Plaintiff\u2019s discharge at the time. AR 139.

Reg. No. 0067714, P.O. Box 340214, Dayton, Ohio\n45422\n      Attorney for Appellant, Mother\n\n                                         .............\n\n\n\nWELBAUM, J.\n\f                                                                                       -2-\n\n\n\n\n      {\u00b6 1} Mother appeals from a juvenile court judgment awarding legal custody of her\n\nthree children, Charles, Connie, and Clark, to non-relative care-givers, Tina and David.1\n\nIn her sole assignment of error, Mother contends that the juvenile court erred in awarding\n\ncustody to Tina and David because, at the time of the second custody hearing, two of the\n\nchildren (Connie and Clark) wished to return home to Mother. In addition, Mother argues\n\nthat she had completed her case plan requirements.\n\n      {\u00b6 2} After considering the record and applicable law, we conclude that Mother\u2019s\n\nassignment of error is without merit. Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment will be\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Facts and Course of Proceedings\n\n      {\u00b6 3} In this appeal, three dockets were submitted, one for each child. Because\n\nthe dockets are essentially the same, we will refer to the docket in Case No. 2018-5509,\n\nwhich is the docket for the eldest child, Charles. We note that Charles and Connie have\n\nthe same father (E.J.), and Clark\u2019s father is Y.I. Neither father has appealed from the\n\nlegal custody award.\n\n      {\u00b6 4} In early November 2018, Montgomery County Children Services (\u201cMCCS\u201d)\n\nfiled complaints based on abuse, neglect, and dependency involving the three children.\n\n\n\n1 To avoid excessive use of initials, which can become confusing, we will refer to C.T.1,\nC.T.2, and C.T.3, respectively, as Charles, Connie, and Clark. These are not their real\nnames. The birth years of the children, respectively, are 2006, 2007, and 2012. At the\ntime of the juvenile court\u2019s legal custody award in June 2021, the children were ages 14,\n13, and nine years old. We will also refer to the legal custodians as Tina and David.\nAgain, these are not the real names.\n\f                                                                                        -3-\n\n\nThis was a refiling of prior complaints that could not be adjudicated within the statutory\n\ntime.\n\n        {\u00b6 5} According to the complaint in Charles\u2019s case, MCCS received a referral on\n\nSeptember 4, 2018, alleging that Mother\u2019s house was in a deplorable condition and that\n\nthere were concerns about Mother\u2019s lack of supervision of the children and the lack of\n\nutilities. Complaint (Nov. 21, 2018), p. 1.\n\n        {\u00b6 6} After some difficulty making contact with Mother, MCCS caseworker Beth,\n\ncalled the police and was able to enter Mother\u2019s house with Mother\u2019s permission on\n\nSeptember 5, 2018. When Beth entered the home, there was an overwhelming smell.\n\nBeth and the officers observed trash, clutter, old food, clothing, and other items, and the\n\nhouse was infested with roaches. Id. at p. 2. The refrigerator did not work, did not\n\ncontain any food, and was also filled with roaches. While the freezer contained food, it\n\ndid not work, also had roaches, and the food was rotting.        Id.   In addition, Mother\n\nadmitted that she worked third shift and had left the children unattended in the home while\n\nshe was at work. Id. At the time of their removal, Charles was 12 years old; Connie\n\nwas 10 years old, and Clark was six years old.\n\n        {\u00b6 7} Charles was placed with an adult sister, C.B., on a safety plan. However,\n\nshe was unable to care for all the children.      Because MCCS was unsuccessful in\n\nestablishing a safety plan for the two other children, the police had to place them in\n\nMCCS\u2019s custody. Mother was also arrested and charged with three counts of child\n\nendangerment. Id. In the complaint, MCCS asked for an award of temporary custody\n\nto C.B. or, alternatively, to MCCS.\n\n        {\u00b6 8} After the complaint was filed, the juvenile court scheduled an interim order\n\f                                                                                        -4-\n\n\nhearing for November 21, 2018, appointed counsel for the children and Mother, and\n\nappointed a guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d).     The complaint was also amended to reflect an\n\nalternative disposition of temporary custody to Tina.\n\n      {\u00b6 9} After the hearing, a magistrate issued an interim order on November 21,\n\n2018, granting temporary custody of the three children to Tina, by agreement, and Mother\n\nwas granted monitored parenting time with the children. At that point, the GAL had filed\n\na report recommending that Tina be given temporary custody. Among other things, the\n\nGAL noted that \u201cthis is one of the worst dirty house cases the undersigned has ever seen.\u201d\n\nGAL Report and Recommendations (Nov. 21, 2018), p. 3. The GAL further noted that\n\nthis was the third time Mother\u2019s children had been removed. The children were returned\n\nthe first time after six months, and the second time after one year. Id. Charles and\n\nConnie also had special needs; Connie was on the autistic spectrum but high-functioning,\n\nand Charles had hearing loss in one ear and suffered from epilepsy. Id. at p. 4-5.\n\nMother\u2019s adult daughter, C.B., who had been caring for Charles, also had said that\n\nMother\u2019s problems were deeply ingrained and that the children should not be returned to\n\nMother. Id. at p. 5.\n\n      {\u00b6 10} In the initial case plan filed on January 18, 2019, the caseworker observed\n\nthat Mother had a history with Children\u2019s Services in Virginia, where the children had been\n\nremoved and placed in foster care. Furthermore, Mother also had a history with MCCS\n\ndating back to October 2015, due to reports of concern for physical abuse and conditions\n\nin the home. Case Plan (Jan. 18, 2019), p. 3. The caseworker further stated that\n\nMother appeared to be in denial about being the one responsible for the home\u2019s\n\nconditions and had also expressed a lack of understanding over why she should not have\n\f                                                                                          -5-\n\n\nleft her children alone overnight while working, leaving a 12-year old child in charge. Id.\n\nMother additionally reported mental health diagnoses of anxiety and depression and\n\nsome health conditions. Id.      Finally, the caseworker stressed that the children had\n\nexcessive absences and tardiness in school such that they were behind their normal age\n\ngroup. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} The case plan required Mother to obtain a mental health assessment within\n\n90 days and follow any recommendations, to successfully complete a parenting/\n\npsychological   evaluation    within    90    days   and   demonstrate    compliance    with\n\nrecommendations, and to demonstrate an ability to maintain a suitable environment\n\nmeeting the children\u2019s basic needs.          This would include safe, sanitary, and stable\n\nhousing; age appropriate supervision of the children at all times by a responsible adult;\n\nindependent housing with Mother\u2019s name on the lease and the ability to afford long-term\n\nhousing for the family; and nutritional food with means for sanitary preparation and\n\nserving. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother\u2019s additional case plan requirements were as follows: to obtain and\n\nmaintain a legal source of sufficient income to meet the family\u2019s needs, along with\n\nverification through pay stubs; to assure the children had sufficient medical coverage; to\n\nassure that the children attended school daily without unexcused or excessive absences\n\nor tardiness; to attend to the children\u2019s personal hygiene and provide clean, suitable\n\nclothing; to sign releases of information; to cooperate with announced and unannounced\n\nhome visits; to consistently visit the children; and to work with Mother\u2019s doctors to address\n\nany physical concerns. Id. at p. 3-4.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The plan also contained requirements for E.J., who had been very\n\f                                                                                          -6-\n\n\nestranged from his children, Charles and Connie, did not have his own housing, and did\n\nnot have a demonstrable income. Id. at p. 7.     Finally, Y.I., Clark\u2019s father, who lived out\n\nof state, was to participate in the Interstate Compact of the Placement of Children process\n\nto try to obtain custody. Id. at p. 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} After holding an adjudicatory and dispositional hearing on January 22, 2019,\n\nthe magistrate filed a decision and judge\u2019s order finding the three children neglected,\n\ndependent, and abused. Magistrate\u2019s Decision and Judge\u2019s Order (Jan. 22, 2019), p. 2.\n\nIn this regard, the magistrate cited R.C. 2151.04(C), R.C. 2151.03(B), and R.C.\n\n2151.03(A)(2).    Id.   Specifically, the children were endangered due to the home\u2019s\n\ncondition and therefore were neglected and abused. Id. Temporary custody of all three\n\nchildren was granted to Tina and the parents were given parenting time. Id. at p. 4. All\n\nthree parents were also ordered to pay child support. Id. at p. 7-8. On the day of the\n\nhearing, the GAL filed an updated report, noting that all three children were residing with\n\ntheir foster parents, Tina and David, and were doing well.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} On August 9, 2019, MCCS filed an amended case plan, amending the goals\n\nand objectives and adding services, because the parenting/psychological assessment\n\nhad been completed.       According to the case plan, Mother had been working with\n\nEastway Behavioral Health for mental health services but was resistant to treatment\n\nrecommendations. In June 2019, Mother decided to change to Patterson Park Health\n\nCenter. Multiple parties had reported that Mother had increasing struggles with her\n\nbehavior and interaction with others, and she had openly stated her intent to terminate\n\nthe children\u2019s relationship with family members and others because she perceived she\n\nhad been \u201cdone wrong\u201d by them. Amended Case Plan (Aug. 9, 2019), p. 2. Mother had\n\f                                                                                           -7-\n\n\nalso begun parenting classes but struggled with being appropriate with and in front of her\n\nchildren. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Among the additions to Mother\u2019s services were specialized treatment for\n\npersonality disorder weekly for 24 months; individual psychotherapy weekly for 24\n\nmonths; parenting skills training for 12 months; and that Mother not engage in conflicts\n\nwith others in front of the children or place them in the middle with regard to her conflicts.\n\nId. at p. 12. On September 9, 2019, the court approved the amended case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} On September 12, 2019, MCCS filed a motion and affidavit with the court,\n\nasking that legal custody of the children be granted to Tina and David. In the affidavit,\n\nthe caseworker, Beth, stated that Mother had not made significant progress on her case\n\nplan objectives. Although Mother had engaged in mental health treatment and was\n\nenrolled in parenting classes, she had not displayed better parenting choices. Motion and\n\nAffidavit for Legal Custody (Sep. 12, 2019), Affidavit, p. 1. And despite knowing that her\n\nnegative behaviors upset the children, Mother continued to initiate negative interactions\n\nwith her adult daughter, with a maternal aunt, with E.J., and with Tina and David in front\n\nof the children. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} The affidavit further noted that E.J., the legal father of Charles and Connie,\n\nhad stopped cooperating and visiting, did not have income or housing, and had failed to\n\ncomplete an assessment for mental health services. Id.         The children were doing well\n\nin the foster home, and Tina and David were willing to provide for the children on a\n\npermanent basis. Id. at p. 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} A semi-annual administrative review (\u201cSAR\u201d) was also filed on September\n\n12, 2019, outlining the same issues, including more detail about Mother\u2019s negative\n\f                                                                                          -8-\n\n\nbehavior, including verbal abuse of Tina and Mother\u2019s inappropriate comments to the\n\nchildren about listening to Tina, that Tina was bad, that they should not listen to Tina, and\n\nthat Tina only wanted the children for the money. SAR (Sept. 12, 2019), p. 3.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} On September 27, 2019, Mother filed a motion for temporary or legal\n\ncustody with protective supervision or, alternatively, for a first extension of temporary\n\ncustody to Tina and David. Mother also requested unsupervised visitation. The GAL\n\nthen submitted another report on October 2, 2019. The GAL noted that while Mother\n\nhad made considerable progress on several fronts, he could not recommend returning\n\ncustody to Mother at that time.       GAL Report (Sept. 27, 2019), p. 9.          The GAL\n\nrecommended giving Tina and David legal custody and increasing Mother\u2019s visitation.\n\nId.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} On October 2, 2019, the magistrate filed an order requiring that an interstate\n\nhome study be conducted for Clark\u2019s father, Y.I. The magistrate also set a dispositional\n\nhearing for December 4, 2019.        Subsequently, in mid-October 2019, MCCS filed a\n\nmotion to show cause against E.J., because he had not paid child support as ordered.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} After the dispositional hearing was held, the magistrate filed an order on\n\nDecember 5, 2019, continuing MCCS\u2019s protective supervision and granting Mother two\n\nhours of supervised visitation per week. The matter was then continued until March 6,\n\n2020, because the dispositional hearing had not yet concluded. Following a contempt\n\nhearing on January 9, 2020, E.J. was held in contempt and was sentenced to 30 days in\n\njail, with the sentence being suspended on the condition that he pay support.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} On March 9, 2020, the GAL filed another report, based on his most recent\n\nvisitation with Mother and the children. While the children had visited with Mother in her\n\f                                                                                         -9-\n\n\nhome, the GAL was concerned because Mother had been pressuring the children to say\n\nthat they wanted to live with her and had been asking them questions and taking notes.\n\nThe GAL noted that Mother\u2019s house was adequate for the children and that Mother was\n\nworking.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} However, while Mother was in a much better place than when the case\n\nbegan, the GAL still had concerns. Mother had very little family support and a long\n\nhistory of problems. GAL Report (March 9, 2020), p. 6.         Mother also minimized the\n\nconditions causing removal and indicated that she would minimize contact with other\n\nfamily members and Tina and David if she received custody. Id. at p. 6-7. The GAL\n\nwas concerned that the children would be isolated, especially at a time when they were\n\nmost vulnerable. Id. at p. 7. Due to these concerns, the fact that the children had\n\n\u201cbloomed\u201d in their current situation, Mother\u2019s lack of insight and prior actions indicating\n\nthat her mental health and parenting skills were questionable, and concern over whether\n\nMother could maintain her current path, the GAL recommended that Tina and David\n\nreceive legal custody and that Mother be allowed expanded visitation. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} The dispositional hearing continued on March 6, 2020.          Following the\n\nhearing, the magistrate concluded that Mother was not able to adequately care for the\n\nchildren on a full-time basis and that neither father was able to adequately care for them.\n\nMagistrate\u2019s Decision and Judge\u2019s Order (March 18, 2020), p. 2. After discussing the\n\nfacts of the case, the magistrate held that it was in the children\u2019s best interest to remain\n\nin the custody of Tina and David, with MCCS to have protective supervision for six\n\nmonths. Id. at p. 6. Mother was also granted progressive parenting time, beginning\n\nwith three hours of unsupervised parenting time on April 6, 2020, and ending up with the\n\f                                                                                          -10-\n\n\ncourt\u2019s standard order of parenting time on May 18, 2020, unless Mother created turmoil\n\nor conflict with the children or their custodians. In that event, Mother\u2019s visits would be\n\nmoved to Erma\u2019s House. Id. at p. 7. The magistrate also denied Mother\u2019s request for\n\nan extension of temporary custody.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Mother filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on April 5, 2020, and\n\nsupplemental objections on June 18, 2020, after hearing transcripts were filed.          On\n\nMarch 5, 2021, MCCS filed a SAR indicating that Mother was not working due to back\n\nsurgery in November 2020. At the time of the SAR, Mother was living with her sister and\n\nhad also been diagnosed with a brain tumor, with an MRI scheduled for April 2021. Id.\n\nat p. 15. Mother was visiting with the children two hours a week at the daycare where\n\nTina worked. Id. at p. 15-16. There was continuing tension in the relationship between\n\nTina and Mother and continued concerns that Mother had engaged the children in\n\ninappropriate adult conversations. Id. at p. 15 and 17.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} On June 22, 2021, the juvenile judge issued an order overruling Mother\u2019s\n\nobjections and finding it was in the children\u2019s best interest to grant legal custody to Tina\n\nand David. Like the magistrate, the court granted progressive parenting time, contingent\n\non Mother\u2019s refraining from creating turmoil or conflict with the children or the custodians.\n\nBoth fathers were given parenting time as agreed to by the parties.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} Mother then timely appealed from the juvenile court\u2019s judgment. As noted,\n\nneither father appealed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Award of Custody to a Non-Relative\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Mother\u2019s sole assignment of error states that:\n\f                                                                                         -11-\n\n\n              The Juvenile Court Erred When It Awarded Legal Custody of the\n\n       Children in This Case to a Non-Relative.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} In support of this assignment of error, Mother contends that the juvenile\n\ncourt erred in the custody award because it was in the children\u2019s best interest to at least\n\nextend temporary custody. Mother notes that two of the children wished to reunify with\n\nher by the time of the second hearing, and that she had completed her case plan\n\nobjectives.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Before we consider these points, we will briefly outline the standard of\n\nreview as well as the law pertaining to awards of legal custody under R.C. 2151.353(A)(3),\n\nwhich applies here.\n\n\n\n                                     A. Standard of Review\n\n       {\u00b6 32} In reviewing legal custody decisions, we will reverse only if the lower court\n\nhas abused its discretion. In re I.R., 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28160, 2019-Ohio-2037,\n\n\u00b6 7. An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or\n\nunconscionable.\u201d Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140\n\n(1983). However, \u201cmost instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are\n\nsimply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.\u201d AAAA\n\nEnts., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157,\n\n161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Furthermore, in reviewing trial court decisions, we have often stressed that\n\n\u201c[c]redibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are primarily matters\n\nfor triers of facts to resolve.\u201d Buckeye Retirement Co., LLC v. Busch, 2017-Ohio-4009,\n\f                                                                                           -12-\n\n\n82 N.E.3d 66, \u00b6 55 (2d Dist.), citing State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 227 N.E.2d\n\n212 (1967). This is \u201c[b]ecause the factfinder, be it the jury or, as in this case, the trial\n\njudge, has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses * * *.\u201d State v. Lawson, 2d Dist.\n\nMontgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997).                 As a result, \u201c[t]he\n\ndecision whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses is\n\nwithin the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who has seen and heard the witness.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n\n\n       B. Legal Standards Applying to R.C. 2151.353(A)(3) Awards of Legal Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 34} After a child has been adjudicated a dependent, neglected or abused child,\n\nthe juvenile court may, as an alternative to permanent custody, \u201caward legal custody of a\n\ndependent child to a parent or to any other person who asks for legal custody or is\n\nproposed as a legal custodian.\u201d In re R.H.B., 2d Dist.

We will do the same, focusing on the hearing testimony in\n\naddition to the record as outlined above, and the particular factors that are pertinent here.\n\nThe individuals who testified at the two hearings included: Beth, the MCCS caseworker;\n\nKelly, an intervention specialist with Horace Mann Elementary School who had regular\n\ncontact with Charles and Connie and who had Connie in her class during fourth and fifth\n\ngrade; Mother\u2019s adult daughter, C.B.; Tina; Scott Burka, who had been the foster parent\n\nin Virginia for Charles and Connie for six months in 2011 and for all three children for\n\nabout 12 months in 2012 to 2013; Anthony Raterman, a counselor who treated Mother;\n\nand Mother.\n\n\n\n                             (1) R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) Factors\n\n                                  (a) The parents\u2019 wishes\n\n       {\u00b6 40} Mother wished to have custody of the children returned to her, but if that did\n\nnot occur, then she wanted the court to grant a temporary extension and unsupervised\n\nand overnight visitation at her home. Transcript of Proceedings (\u201cTr.\u201d), p. 244 and 245-\n\n255. Mother also did not want custody of Clark to be given to Y.I., because she did not\n\nwant the children separated. Id. at p. 247. Y.I. strongly wanted the children to remain\n\ntogether in Tina and David\u2019s home; if the court did not choose that route, he wanted\n\ncustody and was opposed to having Clark returned to Mother, as he did not want the risk\n\nof Clark being removed for a third time. Id. at p. 186.\n\f                                                                                       -15-\n\n\n      {\u00b6 41} E.J. had not seen Charles or Connie for at least five months before the\n\nhearing, and his wishes were unknown at the time of the hearing. Previously, E.J. told\n\nMCCS that he feared the children being returned to Mother and felt they were doing much\n\nbetter in their current situation. Id. at p. 197. This factor leaned toward leaving the\n\nchildren where they were.\n\n\n\n                                (b) The children\u2019s wishes\n\n      {\u00b6 42} There was no in-chambers interview of the children.           However, the\n\nchildren\u2019s attorney filed a notice with the court on March 13, 2020, indicating that while\n\nhe had missed the last custody hearing due to an emergency illness that landed him in\n\nthe hospital, his clients wished to remain in their current placement. Notice (March 13,\n\n2020), p. 1. The GAL did say in his last report that the two younger children had said\n\nthat they wished to live with their mother. GAL Report (March 6, 2020), p. 4. However,\n\nthe GAL also stated that:\n\n             The children have reported to various sources, including this GAL,\n\n      that their mother pressures them to say that they want to come back to live\n\n      with her. She has been seen asking questions and taking notes of their\n\n      answers with regard to this. This has reportedly been happening at the\n\n      end of every visit recently. The undersigned is very concerned that the\n\n      children are being put in the middle of a situation that they did not create\n\n      and should not be made to feel responsible for.\n\nId. at p. 5-6. This factor weighed against returning the children to Mother.\n\f                                                                                           -16-\n\n\n            (c) The children\u2019s interaction with parents, siblings, and others affecting\n\n                                   the children\u2019s best interest\n\n       {\u00b6 43} There is no question that the children love Mother and that she loves them.\n\nTr. at p. 26 and 160. Mother also had consistently visited with the children. Id. at p. 25,\n\n178, and 181. However, the children told both Beth, the caseworker, and Tina that while\n\nthey loved Mother and did not want to hurt her feelings, they were happy and wanted to\n\nstay where they felt safe. Id. at p. 27 and 117-118. Mother had also talked negatively\n\nto the children about the other adults in their lives, leaving the children in the middle. Id.\n\nat p. 40.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} The children were very close with their former foster family in Virginia (the\n\nBurkas), who had fostered the two eldest children for six months when Mother was\n\npregnant with Clark and for a year in 2012-2013 after Clark was born. Id. at p. 153, 158,\n\nand 259. After the children were returned to Mother and came to Ohio, the Burkas kept\n\nin contact. They visited, loaned money to Mother in 2018 so that she could have her\n\nelectricity turned back on, and kept the children for a month that summer to help Mother\n\nstabilize her situation (to no avail, as the children were removed in September 2018,\n\nbased on deplorable conditions in the home). Id. at p. 155-158.               During the court\n\nproceedings, the Burkas, Y.I., Tina, David, and the children all visited together when Tina\n\nand David took the children to Virginia during spring break. Id. at 31 and 159.           Mr.\n\nBurka described the relationship between all these people as \u201ca village that is helping\n\nraise these children.\u201d Id. at p. 159.\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Clark\u2019s father, Y.I., who lived in Virginia, visited Clark as often as he could,\n\nhad phone contact around three times a week with Clark, and had always been involved\n\f                                                                                      -17-\n\n\nwith all three children, not just with his own child.     Id. at p. 31, 70, 186, and 187.\n\nUnfortunately, despite MCCS\u2019s repeated efforts, the state of Virginia had refused to\n\nconduct a home study for Y.I.     Id. at p. 26, 71, and 185.\n\n      {\u00b6 46} Until the day of the final hearing in March 2020, Mother had \u201cconsistently\n\nand repeatedly\u201d said that once the children were returned to her, she would sever the\n\nchildren\u2019s relationships with the Burkas, with Tina and David, with the children\u2019s adult\n\nsister, C.B., and with Mother\u2019s sister, despite being made aware that the children cared\n\nfor these people and were afraid of that happening. Tr. at p. 34 and 180.    Mother also\n\ntold C.B. that she would not be allowed to see or speak with the children if they were\n\nreturned. Id. at p. 93.\n\n      {\u00b6 47} Finally, E.J. had sporadic contact with the children before they were\n\nremoved and had not seen them for several months before the final custody hearing. Id.\n\nat p. 182, 198 and 238.\n\n      {\u00b6 48} Depriving the children of supportive people who care about them and have\n\naided them in the past did not serve the children\u2019s best interest. Therefore, this factor\n\ndid not support giving Mother legal custody.\n\n\n\n           (d) The children's adjustment to the their home, school, and community\n\n      {\u00b6 49} Without question, the children were living in very bad circumstances before\n\nthey were removed.        Moreover, as indicated, Connie has special needs due to her\n\nautism. Connie\u2019s teacher, Kelly, testified at the hearing. Kelly, a teacher with 40 years\n\nof experience, is an intervention specialist who writes individualized education programs\n\n(IEPs) and sits in on IEP meetings. Tr. at p. 78-79. Kelly was familiar with both Clark\n\f                                                                                        -18-\n\n\nand Connie, and Connie was in Kelly\u2019s class for the fourth and fifth grades, during the\n\n2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. Id. In other words, Kelly had close contact\n\nwith Connie both before and after she was removed from Mother\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 50} Before the children were removed, Connie was often very late for school\n\nand wore clothes that were ill-fitting and not clean. Connie also had hygiene issues. Id.\n\nat p 79. Connie came to school with food and dirt on her face and had a very hard time\n\nmaking friends. In addition to having autism, Connie had attention deficit hyperactivity\n\ndisorder, for which she was not medicated. As a result, Connie could not pay attention\n\nor have conversations with other children.         Id. at p. 80.    Because of Connie\u2019s\n\nappearance, other children ostracized her and did not interact with her. They even asked\n\nnot to sit beside Connie because she did not smell good at times. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 51} Due to this situation, Kelly kept a hairbrush, a toothbrush, toothpaste and\n\nwipes at her desk, so that Connie could clean up before coming into class. Kelly also\n\nkept a detangler product in her desk because Connie\u2019s hair was tangled. The ill-fitting\n\nclothes and cleanliness were brought up during IEP meetings, but Mother blamed it on\n\nConnie. Id. at p. 79-81.       Mother said that Connie would not get up, did not take care\n\nof herself, and was going to have to deal with the consequences. Id. at p. 81. Clark\n\nalso came to school messy at times, but his hair was shorter. Id. at p. 82.\n\n       {\u00b6 52} After the children were removed, there was a \u201cnight and day difference. * * *\n\nThe children came in clean. They came in well rested. They didn\u2019t act like they were\n\ngoing to fall asleep.\u201d   Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Before the children were removed, Connie had more days that she was\n\ntardy than she was on time. Afterward, she had only excused tardiness or absence, like\n\f                                                                                        -19-\n\n\nfor doctor\u2019s appointments. Tr. at p. 85. Connie made great progress after removal; she\n\nwas getting her work done, was getting her medication regularly, had clothes that fit, was\n\nclean, and no longer had black circles under her eyes. Id. at p. 83 and 88. Kelly\n\ndescribed the children (Connie and Clark) after removal as being happy and like regular\n\nkids. Id. at p. 84.\n\n       {\u00b6 54} For the first few months after removal, the eldest child, Charles, lived with\n\nhis adult sister, C.B., and her husband. Id. at p. 96. During that time, Charles was\n\nhappy and seemed relieved. Id. Custody was then switched to Tina and David, due to\n\nfrustration and disagreements between Mother and C.B. Id. at p. 78, 86, 91, and 97.\n\nC.B. was calling the caseworker two or three times a week regarding various texting or\n\nverbal conflicts with Mother about Charles. Id. at p. 78.\n\n       {\u00b6 55} At the hearing, C.B. described her relationship with Mother as having been\n\nrocky her entire life. Id. at p. 90. C.B. indicated that when she lived with Mother, there\n\nwere similar issues with bugs, roaches, and cleanliness, which happened over and over\n\nagain. Id. at p. 91 and 96.\n\n       {\u00b6 56} Before being removed, Charles also had attendance issues and was\n\nacademically behind. Id. at p. 16 and 17-18.     Afterward, his attendance improved and\n\nhe made good progress in making up academic ground. Id. at p. 17-18.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} For the 2019-2020 school year, the children transferred to the local schools\n\nwhere Tina and David lived.      The children adjusted well, were happy at their new\n\nschools, and were doing well and making friends. Tr. at p. 16 and 67. Charles and\n\nConnie had been steadily improving at school, making up the deficits they had before\n\nbeing removed. Id. at p. 14, 15, 17-18, and 169.      Both Charles and Connie were also\n\f                                                                                         -20-\n\n\nin counseling, which was provided through their school. Id. at p. 169-170. In addition,\n\nthey were involved in extracurricular activities.     Id. at p. 16.    Clark had been in\n\ncounseling, but it was discontinued because the counselors did not feel he needed it. He\n\nwas also doing very well in school academically. Id. at p. 171.\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Moreover, while Mother did attend some extracurricular activities, she\n\ncaused conflict (up to the few months before the second custody hearing) by being hostile\n\ntoward the children\u2019s custodians. Mother had engaged in disruptive enough behavior\n\nthat the police trespassed her from the Beavercreek YMCA. Id. at p. 40-41, 101-106,\n\nand 112.    While the custodial parents originally attempted to include Mother in various\n\nevents, including coming into their home outside Mother\u2019s scheduled visitation time,\n\nMother\u2019s behavior and animosity became such that Tina discontinued this. Id. at 101-\n\n103.\n\n       {\u00b6 59} Finally, the GAL reported in his latest report that \u201cthe needs of the children\n\nare being met in their current placements, and they seem happy and well-adjusted. They\n\nhave blossomed in their current placement.\u201d GAL Report (March 6, 2020), at p. 7.\n\n       {\u00b6 60} Without question, this factor weighed against Mother. The children were\n\nsafer and happier and did much better at school after they were removed.\n\n\n\n                  (e) The mental and physical health of all persons involved\n\n       {\u00b6 61} Facts pertaining to this issue have been discussed above. Two of the\n\nchildren (Charles and Connie) had special needs that were being addressed after their\n\nremoval, and they were both in counseling (which they were not involved in before\n\nremoval). Mother had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and was taking\n\f                                                                                         -21-\n\n\nmedication. Tr. at p. 204, 214, and 253. By Mother\u2019s account, the medication was\n\nhelping. Id. at p. 253.\n\n       {\u00b6 62} No testimony was presented about the mental or physical health of E.J.,\n\nY.I., Tina, or David. This factor was essentially neutral.\n\n\n\n            (f) The parent more likely to honor and facilitate court-approved\n\n                parenting time rights or visitation and companionship rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 63} MCCS\u2019s caseworker indicated that Tina and David had been extremely\n\nflexible and open in working with all the adults in the children\u2019s lives and had facilitated\n\nrelationships between the children and their support networks. Tr. at p. 188. This is\n\nalso evident in the testimony related above. In contrast, Mother had indicated an intent\n\nnot to cooperate, both in her behavior and statements, despite a last-minute attempt to\n\nindicate otherwise. Mother's change of position with respect to severing the children's\n\nrelationships, made at the last hearing, contradicted what she had said during the entirety\n\nof the case and during the caseworker's last home visit, three weeks before the last\n\nhearing.   Id. at p. 34, 180 and 275-276.          Mother\u2019s statements, therefore, were\n\nunconvincing. Accordingly, this factor weighed against giving Mother legal custody of\n\nthe children.\n\n\n\n       (g) Whether either parent has failed to make all child support payments,\n\n       including all arrearages, that are required of that parent pursuant to a child\n\n                    support order under which that parent is an obligor\n\n       {\u00b6 64} At the time of the last custody hearing, Mother was current in her child\n\f                                                                                        -22-\n\n\nsupport payments. Due to her complaint that the support burden required her to work\n\ntoo much, the court reduced her support obligation. Id. at p. 245-246, and Order (June\n\n22, 2021), at p. 22. Y.I. had also paid his child support, and E.J. had not paid any child\n\nsupport. This factor was neutral with respect to Mother and Y.I., and was in Mother\u2019s\n\nfavor vis-\u00e0-vis E.J.\n\n\n\n                  (h) Convictions or Adjudications for Abuse or Neglect\n\n       {\u00b6 65} In this case, Mother had been adjudicated of having abused and neglected\n\nthe children due to her home\u2019s condition. Magistrate\u2019s Decision and Judge\u2019s Order (Jan.\n\n22, 2019), at p. 2, citing R.C. 2151.04(C), R.C. 2151.03(B), and R.C. 2151.03(A)(2). This\n\nfactor, therefore, weighed against granting legal custody to Mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 66} No evidence was presented concerning R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(i) and (j), and\n\nwe need not consider them. From the preceding discussion, it is clear that nearly all the\n\nfactors weighed against giving Mother legal custody and in favor of granting legal custody\n\nto Tina and David.\n\n\n\n                                (2) R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) Factors\n\n       {\u00b6 67} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) states that various factors should be considered in\n\ndeciding a child\u2019s best interest, and the juvenile court discussed these points as well. We\n\nwill briefly consider these matters.\n\n\n\n              (a) Interaction of those who may significantly affect the child\n\n       {\u00b6 68} We have already discussed this factor in connection with R.C.\n\f                                                                                       -23-\n\n\n3109.04(F)(1)(a) and need not consider it further.\n\n\n\n        (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through\n\n        the child's guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child\n\n      {\u00b6 69} We have already discussed this point, and this factor weighed against\n\ngranting Mother legal custody.\n\n\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been\n\n       in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies\n\n            or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a\n\n           consecutive twenty-two-month period, or the child has been in the\n\n         temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or\n\n       private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive\n\n        twenty-two-month period and, as described in division (D)(1) of section\n\n       2151.413 of the Revised Code, the child was previously in the temporary\n\n                    custody of an equivalent agency in another state\n\n      {\u00b6 70} As noted, Charles and Connie had previously been removed from Mother\u2019s\n\ncare for a total of 18 months in Virginia, and Clark had been removed from Mother\u2019s care\n\nfor about 12 months.      This factor weighed against Mother.        Notably, MCCS was\n\nparticularly concerned about Mother\u2019s ability to maintain progress and the impact of yet\n\nanother removal on the children. Tr. at p. 33, 176, 181, and 188.\n\n\n\n       (d) The child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that\n\f                                                                                          -24-\n\n\n        type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the\n\n                                              agency\n\n       {\u00b6 71} Although permanent custody is not being considered here, the juvenile court\n\nconsidered Mother\u2019s case plan in detail and found that Mother had completed some case\n\nplan   objectives    such   as    the   requirement     to   obtain   mental    health   and\n\npsychological/parenting assessments. However most of the rest of Mother\u2019s case plan\n\nobjectives were \u201congoing,\u201d and one objective (attending medical and educational\n\nappointments) was incomplete. Order (June 22, 2021), at p. 10-13. Consequently,\n\ncontrary to Mother\u2019s claim, she did not complete all her case plan requirements. The\n\ntestimony supported the court\u2019s conclusion. Tr. at p. 22, 24, 26, 176-177, 179, and181.\n\n       {\u00b6 72} Having reviewed the entire record, we agree that while Mother had made\n\nprogress on her case plan, there was reason for concern over whether her progress could\n\nbe sustained. In particular, some progress (such as refraining from conflict) was quite\n\nrecent, and other progress (like agreeing not to sever relationships that benefit the\n\nchildren) was, frankly, not credible. Furthermore, Mother had a long history of having\n\nher children removed and of having parenting and cleanliness issues. In contrast, the\n\nperiod of progress had been brief.\n\n\n\n         (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section\n\n                         apply in relation to the parents and child\n\n       {\u00b6 73} These factors involve matters like convictions for certain crimes involving a\n\nsibling or a child living in a parent\u2019s household, refusal of medical treatment or food to the\n\nchild, placing the child in substantial harm due to alcohol or drug abuse, abandonment of\n\f                                                                                         -25-\n\n\nthe child, and prior termination of parental rights to a sibling of the child. The juvenile\n\ncourt did not find that any of these factors applied to Mother, but it did conclude that E.J.\n\nhad abandoned Charles and Connie by failing to visit with them for the preceding 90 days\n\nand by failing to contact MCCS. This finding was well-supported in the record.\n\n       {\u00b6 74} Finally, the juvenile court concluded that MCCS had made reasonable\n\nefforts to prevent the children\u2019s removal, to eliminate the continued removal, or to make\n\nit possible for the children to safely return. Order (July 22, 2021), at p. 15-16. Again,\n\nwe agree with the court.\n\n       {\u00b6 75} Based on the preceding discussion, we reject Mother\u2019s arguments and find\n\nno error by the juvenile court.      Accordingly, Mother\u2019s sole assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 76} The judgment of the juvenile court is affirmed.\n\n                                      .............\n\n\n\nTUCKER, P.J. and DONOVAN, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H.

HECK, JR., by HEATHER N. KETTER, Atty. Reg. No. 0084470, Assistant\nProsecuting Attorney, Montgomery County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Appellate Division,\nMontgomery County Courts Building, 301 West Third Street, Dayton, Ohio 45422\n      Attorney for Appellee, Montgomery County Children Services\n\nROBERT ALAN BRENNER, Atty. Reg. No. 0067714, P.O. Box 340214, Dayton, Ohio\n45422\n      Attorney for Appellant, Mother\n\n                                         .............\n\n\n\nWELBAUM, J.\n\f                                                                                       -2-\n\n\n\n\n      {\u00b6 1} Mother appeals from a juvenile court judgment awarding legal custody of her\n\nthree children, Charles, Connie, and Clark, to non-relative care-givers, Tina and David.1\n\nIn her sole assignment of error, Mother contends that the juvenile court erred in awarding\n\ncustody to Tina and David because, at the time of the second custody hearing, two of the\n\nchildren (Connie and Clark) wished to return home to Mother. In addition, Mother argues\n\nthat she had completed her case plan requirements.\n\n      {\u00b6 2} After considering the record and applicable law, we conclude that Mother\u2019s\n\nassignment of error is without merit. Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment will be\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Facts and Course of Proceedings\n\n      {\u00b6 3} In this appeal, three dockets were submitted, one for each child. Because\n\nthe dockets are essentially the same, we will refer to the docket in Case No. 2018-5509,\n\nwhich is the docket for the eldest child, Charles. We note that Charles and Connie have\n\nthe same father (E.J.), and Clark\u2019s father is Y.I. Neither father has appealed from the\n\nlegal custody award.\n\n      {\u00b6 4} In early November 2018, Montgomery County Children Services (\u201cMCCS\u201d)\n\nfiled complaints based on abuse, neglect, and dependency involving the three children.\n\n\n\n1 To avoid excessive use of initials, which can become confusing, we will refer to C.T.1,\nC.T.2, and C.T.3, respectively, as Charles, Connie, and Clark. These are not their real\nnames. The birth years of the children, respectively, are 2006, 2007, and 2012. At the\ntime of the juvenile court\u2019s legal custody award in June 2021, the children were ages 14,\n13, and nine years old. We will also refer to the legal custodians as Tina and David.\nAgain, these are not the real names.\n\f                                                                                        -3-\n\n\nThis was a refiling of prior complaints that could not be adjudicated within the statutory\n\ntime.\n\n        {\u00b6 5} According to the complaint in Charles\u2019s case, MCCS received a referral on\n\nSeptember 4, 2018, alleging that Mother\u2019s house was in a deplorable condition and that\n\nthere were concerns about Mother\u2019s lack of supervision of the children and the lack of\n\nutilities. Complaint (Nov. 21, 2018), p. 1.\n\n        {\u00b6 6} After some difficulty making contact with Mother, MCCS caseworker Beth,\n\ncalled the police and was able to enter Mother\u2019s house with Mother\u2019s permission on\n\nSeptember 5, 2018. When Beth entered the home, there was an overwhelming smell.\n\nBeth and the officers observed trash, clutter, old food, clothing, and other items, and the\n\nhouse was infested with roaches. Id. at p. 2. The refrigerator did not work, did not\n\ncontain any food, and was also filled with roaches. While the freezer contained food, it\n\ndid not work, also had roaches, and the food was rotting.        Id.   In addition, Mother\n\nadmitted that she worked third shift and had left the children unattended in the home while\n\nshe was at work. Id. At the time of their removal, Charles was 12 years old; Connie\n\nwas 10 years old, and Clark was six years old.\n\n        {\u00b6 7} Charles was placed with an adult sister, C.B., on a safety plan. However,\n\nshe was unable to care for all the children.      Because MCCS was unsuccessful in\n\nestablishing a safety plan for the two other children, the police had to place them in\n\nMCCS\u2019s custody. Mother was also arrested and charged with three counts of child\n\nendangerment. Id. In the complaint, MCCS asked for an award of temporary custody\n\nto C.B. or, alternatively, to MCCS.\n\n        {\u00b6 8} After the complaint was filed, the juvenile court scheduled an interim order\n\f                                                                                        -4-\n\n\nhearing for November 21, 2018, appointed counsel for the children and Mother, and\n\nappointed a guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d).     The complaint was also amended to reflect an\n\nalternative disposition of temporary custody to Tina.\n\n      {\u00b6 9} After the hearing, a magistrate issued an interim order on November 21,\n\n2018, granting temporary custody of the three children to Tina, by agreement, and Mother\n\nwas granted monitored parenting time with the children. At that point, the GAL had filed\n\na report recommending that Tina be given temporary custody. Among other things, the\n\nGAL noted that \u201cthis is one of the worst dirty house cases the undersigned has ever seen.\u201d\n\nGAL Report and Recommendations (Nov. 21, 2018), p. 3. The GAL further noted that\n\nthis was the third time Mother\u2019s children had been removed. The children were returned\n\nthe first time after six months, and the second time after one year. Id. Charles and\n\nConnie also had special needs; Connie was on the autistic spectrum but high-functioning,\n\nand Charles had hearing loss in one ear and suffered from epilepsy. Id. at p. 4-5.\n\nMother\u2019s adult daughter, C.B., who had been caring for Charles, also had said that\n\nMother\u2019s problems were deeply ingrained and that the children should not be returned to\n\nMother. Id. at p. 5.\n\n      {\u00b6 10} In the initial case plan filed on January 18, 2019, the caseworker observed\n\nthat Mother had a history with Children\u2019s Services in Virginia, where the children had been\n\nremoved and placed in foster care. Furthermore, Mother also had a history with MCCS\n\ndating back to October 2015, due to reports of concern for physical abuse and conditions\n\nin the home. Case Plan (Jan. 18, 2019), p. 3. The caseworker further stated that\n\nMother appeared to be in denial about being the one responsible for the home\u2019s\n\nconditions and had also expressed a lack of understanding over why she should not have\n\f                                                                                          -5-\n\n\nleft her children alone overnight while working, leaving a 12-year old child in charge. Id.\n\nMother additionally reported mental health diagnoses of anxiety and depression and\n\nsome health conditions. Id.      Finally, the caseworker stressed that the children had\n\nexcessive absences and tardiness in school such that they were behind their normal age\n\ngroup. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} The case plan required Mother to obtain a mental health assessment within\n\n90 days and follow any recommendations, to successfully complete a parenting/\n\npsychological   evaluation    within    90    days   and   demonstrate    compliance    with\n\nrecommendations, and to demonstrate an ability to maintain a suitable environment\n\nmeeting the children\u2019s basic needs.          This would include safe, sanitary, and stable\n\nhousing; age appropriate supervision of the children at all times by a responsible adult;\n\nindependent housing with Mother\u2019s name on the lease and the ability to afford long-term\n\nhousing for the family; and nutritional food with means for sanitary preparation and\n\nserving. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother\u2019s additional case plan requirements were as follows: to obtain and\n\nmaintain a legal source of sufficient income to meet the family\u2019s needs, along with\n\nverification through pay stubs; to assure the children had sufficient medical coverage; to\n\nassure that the children attended school daily without unexcused or excessive absences\n\nor tardiness; to attend to the children\u2019s personal hygiene and provide clean, suitable\n\nclothing; to sign releases of information; to cooperate with announced and unannounced\n\nhome visits; to consistently visit the children; and to work with Mother\u2019s doctors to address\n\nany physical concerns. Id. at p. 3-4.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} The plan also contained requirements for E.J., who had been very\n\f                                                                                          -6-\n\n\nestranged from his children, Charles and Connie, did not have his own housing, and did\n\nnot have a demonstrable income. Id. at p. 7.     Finally, Y.I., Clark\u2019s father, who lived out\n\nof state, was to participate in the Interstate Compact of the Placement of Children process\n\nto try to obtain custody. Id. at p. 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} After holding an adjudicatory and dispositional hearing on January 22, 2019,\n\nthe magistrate filed a decision and judge\u2019s order finding the three children neglected,\n\ndependent, and abused. Magistrate\u2019s Decision and Judge\u2019s Order (Jan. 22, 2019), p. 2.\n\nIn this regard, the magistrate cited R.C. 2151.04(C), R.C. 2151.03(B), and R.C.\n\n2151.03(A)(2).    Id.   Specifically, the children were endangered due to the home\u2019s\n\ncondition and therefore were neglected and abused. Id. Temporary custody of all three\n\nchildren was granted to Tina and the parents were given parenting time. Id. at p. 4. All\n\nthree parents were also ordered to pay child support. Id. at p. 7-8. On the day of the\n\nhearing, the GAL filed an updated report, noting that all three children were residing with\n\ntheir foster parents, Tina and David, and were doing well.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} On August 9, 2019, MCCS filed an amended case plan, amending the goals\n\nand objectives and adding services, because the parenting/psychological assessment\n\nhad been completed.       According to the case plan, Mother had been working with\n\nEastway Behavioral Health for mental health services but was resistant to treatment\n\nrecommendations. In June 2019, Mother decided to change to Patterson Park Health\n\nCenter. Multiple parties had reported that Mother had increasing struggles with her\n\nbehavior and interaction with others, and she had openly stated her intent to terminate\n\nthe children\u2019s relationship with family members and others because she perceived she\n\nhad been \u201cdone wrong\u201d by them. Amended Case Plan (Aug. 9, 2019), p. 2. Mother had\n\f                                                                                           -7-\n\n\nalso begun parenting classes but struggled with being appropriate with and in front of her\n\nchildren. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Among the additions to Mother\u2019s services were specialized treatment for\n\npersonality disorder weekly for 24 months; individual psychotherapy weekly for 24\n\nmonths; parenting skills training for 12 months; and that Mother not engage in conflicts\n\nwith others in front of the children or place them in the middle with regard to her conflicts.\n\nId. at p. 12. On September 9, 2019, the court approved the amended case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} On September 12, 2019, MCCS filed a motion and affidavit with the court,\n\nasking that legal custody of the children be granted to Tina and David. In the affidavit,\n\nthe caseworker, Beth, stated that Mother had not made significant progress on her case\n\nplan objectives. Although Mother had engaged in mental health treatment and was\n\nenrolled in parenting classes, she had not displayed better parenting choices. Motion and\n\nAffidavit for Legal Custody (Sep. 12, 2019), Affidavit, p. 1. And despite knowing that her\n\nnegative behaviors upset the children, Mother continued to initiate negative interactions\n\nwith her adult daughter, with a maternal aunt, with E.J., and with Tina and David in front\n\nof the children. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} The affidavit further noted that E.J., the legal father of Charles and Connie,\n\nhad stopped cooperating and visiting, did not have income or housing, and had failed to\n\ncomplete an assessment for mental health services. Id.         The children were doing well\n\nin the foster home, and Tina and David were willing to provide for the children on a\n\npermanent basis. Id. at p. 2.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} A semi-annual administrative review (\u201cSAR\u201d) was also filed on September\n\n12, 2019, outlining the same issues, including more detail about Mother\u2019s negative\n\f                                                                                          -8-\n\n\nbehavior, including verbal abuse of Tina and Mother\u2019s inappropriate comments to the\n\nchildren about listening to Tina, that Tina was bad, that they should not listen to Tina, and\n\nthat Tina only wanted the children for the money. SAR (Sept. 12, 2019), p. 3.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} On September 27, 2019, Mother filed a motion for temporary or legal\n\ncustody with protective supervision or, alternatively, for a first extension of temporary\n\ncustody to Tina and David. Mother also requested unsupervised visitation. The GAL\n\nthen submitted another report on October 2, 2019. The GAL noted that while Mother\n\nhad made considerable progress on several fronts, he could not recommend returning\n\ncustody to Mother at that time.       GAL Report (Sept. 27, 2019), p. 9.          The GAL\n\nrecommended giving Tina and David legal custody and increasing Mother\u2019s visitation.\n\nId.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} On October 2, 2019, the magistrate filed an order requiring that an interstate\n\nhome study be conducted for Clark\u2019s father, Y.I. The magistrate also set a dispositional\n\nhearing for December 4, 2019.        Subsequently, in mid-October 2019, MCCS filed a\n\nmotion to show cause against E.J., because he had not paid child support as ordered.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} After the dispositional hearing was held, the magistrate filed an order on\n\nDecember 5, 2019, continuing MCCS\u2019s protective supervision and granting Mother two\n\nhours of supervised visitation per week. The matter was then continued until March 6,\n\n2020, because the dispositional hearing had not yet concluded. Following a contempt\n\nhearing on January 9, 2020, E.J. was held in contempt and was sentenced to 30 days in\n\njail, with the sentence being suspended on the condition that he pay support.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} On March 9, 2020, the GAL filed another report, based on his most recent\n\nvisitation with Mother and the children. While the children had visited with Mother in her\n\f                                                                                         -9-\n\n\nhome, the GAL was concerned because Mother had been pressuring the children to say\n\nthat they wanted to live with her and had been asking them questions and taking notes.\n\nThe GAL noted that Mother\u2019s house was adequate for the children and that Mother was\n\nworking.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} However, while Mother was in a much better place than when the case\n\nbegan, the GAL still had concerns. Mother had very little family support and a long\n\nhistory of problems. GAL Report (March 9, 2020), p. 6.         Mother also minimized the\n\nconditions causing removal and indicated that she would minimize contact with other\n\nfamily members and Tina and David if she received custody. Id. at p. 6-7. The GAL\n\nwas concerned that the children would be isolated, especially at a time when they were\n\nmost vulnerable. Id. at p. 7. Due to these concerns, the fact that the children had\n\n\u201cbloomed\u201d in their current situation, Mother\u2019s lack of insight and prior actions indicating\n\nthat her mental health and parenting skills were questionable, and concern over whether\n\nMother could maintain her current path, the GAL recommended that Tina and David\n\nreceive legal custody and that Mother be allowed expanded visitation. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} The dispositional hearing continued on March 6, 2020.          Following the\n\nhearing, the magistrate concluded that Mother was not able to adequately care for the\n\nchildren on a full-time basis and that neither father was able to adequately care for them.\n\nMagistrate\u2019s Decision and Judge\u2019s Order (March 18, 2020), p. 2. After discussing the\n\nfacts of the case, the magistrate held that it was in the children\u2019s best interest to remain\n\nin the custody of Tina and David, with MCCS to have protective supervision for six\n\nmonths. Id. at p. 6. Mother was also granted progressive parenting time, beginning\n\nwith three hours of unsupervised parenting time on April 6, 2020, and ending up with the\n\f                                                                                          -10-\n\n\ncourt\u2019s standard order of parenting time on May 18, 2020, unless Mother created turmoil\n\nor conflict with the children or their custodians. In that event, Mother\u2019s visits would be\n\nmoved to Erma\u2019s House. Id. at p. 7. The magistrate also denied Mother\u2019s request for\n\nan extension of temporary custody.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Mother filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on April 5, 2020, and\n\nsupplemental objections on June 18, 2020, after hearing transcripts were filed.          On\n\nMarch 5, 2021, MCCS filed a SAR indicating that Mother was not working due to back\n\nsurgery in November 2020. At the time of the SAR, Mother was living with her sister and\n\nhad also been diagnosed with a brain tumor, with an MRI scheduled for April 2021. Id.\n\nat p. 15. Mother was visiting with the children two hours a week at the daycare where\n\nTina worked. Id. at p. 15-16. There was continuing tension in the relationship between\n\nTina and Mother and continued concerns that Mother had engaged the children in\n\ninappropriate adult conversations. Id. at p. 15 and 17.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} On June 22, 2021, the juvenile judge issued an order overruling Mother\u2019s\n\nobjections and finding it was in the children\u2019s best interest to grant legal custody to Tina\n\nand David. Like the magistrate, the court granted progressive parenting time, contingent\n\non Mother\u2019s refraining from creating turmoil or conflict with the children or the custodians.\n\nBoth fathers were given parenting time as agreed to by the parties.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} Mother then timely appealed from the juvenile court\u2019s judgment. As noted,\n\nneither father appealed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Award of Custody to a Non-Relative\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Mother\u2019s sole assignment of error states that:\n\f                                                                                         -11-\n\n\n              The Juvenile Court Erred When It Awarded Legal Custody of the\n\n       Children in This Case to a Non-Relative.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} In support of this assignment of error, Mother contends that the juvenile\n\ncourt erred in the custody award because it was in the children\u2019s best interest to at least\n\nextend temporary custody. Mother notes that two of the children wished to reunify with\n\nher by the time of the second hearing, and that she had completed her case plan\n\nobjectives.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Before we consider these points, we will briefly outline the standard of\n\nreview as well as the law pertaining to awards of legal custody under R.C. 2151.353(A)(3),\n\nwhich applies here.\n\n\n\n                                     A. Standard of Review\n\n       {\u00b6 32} In reviewing legal custody decisions, we will reverse only if the lower court\n\nhas abused its discretion. In re I.R., 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28160, 2019-Ohio-2037,\n\n\u00b6 7. An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or\n\nunconscionable.\u201d Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140\n\n(1983). However, \u201cmost instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are\n\nsimply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.\u201d AAAA\n\nEnts., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157,\n\n161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Furthermore, in reviewing trial court decisions, we have often stressed that\n\n\u201c[c]redibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are primarily matters\n\nfor triers of facts to resolve.\u201d Buckeye Retirement Co., LLC v.

Lawson, 2d Dist.\n\nMontgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997).                 As a result, \u201c[t]he\n\ndecision whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses is\n\nwithin the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who has seen and heard the witness.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n\n\n       B. Legal Standards Applying to R.C. 2151.353(A)(3) Awards of Legal Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 34} After a child has been adjudicated a dependent, neglected or abused child,\n\nthe juvenile court may, as an alternative to permanent custody, \u201caward legal custody of a\n\ndependent child to a parent or to any other person who asks for legal custody or is\n\nproposed as a legal custodian.\u201d In re R.H.B., 2d Dist. Clark No. 2015-CA-12, 2016-Ohio-\n\n729, \u00b6 7, citing R.C. 2151.353A)(3). A legal custody award \u201cvests in the custodian the\n\nright to have physical care and control of the child and to determine where and with whom\n\nthe child shall live, and the right and duty to protect, train, and discipline the child and to\n\nprovide the child with food, shelter, education, and medical care, all subject to any residual\n\nparental rights, privileges, and responsibilities.\u201d R.C. 2151.011(B)(21).\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Unlike permanent custody awards, \u201can award of legal custody of a child\n\ndoes not divest parents of their residual parental rights, privileges, and responsibilities.\u201d\n\nIn re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 17.

These factors\n\n\u201cinclude such things as the parents\u2019 wishes; the child's wishes, if the court has interviewed\n\nthe child; the child's interaction with parents, siblings, and others who may significantly\n\naffect the child's best interest; adjustment of the child to home, school, and community;\n\nand the mental and physical health of all involved persons.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9, citing R.C.\n\n3109.04(F)(1). \u201cWhile \u2018blood relationship\u2019 and \u2018family unity\u2019 (i.e., a preference for a family\n\nmember) are factors to consider when determining a child's best interest, neither one is\n\ncontrolling.

She also notes that two of the children wished to live with her and that she had\n\f                                                                                          -14-\n\n\ncompleted her case plan objectives.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} In awarding legal custody to Tina and David, the juvenile court reviewed all\n\nthe factors in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1), as well as those in R.C. 2151.414(D)(1), to decide the\n\nbest interest of the children. We will do the same, focusing on the hearing testimony in\n\naddition to the record as outlined above, and the particular factors that are pertinent here.\n\nThe individuals who testified at the two hearings included: Beth, the MCCS caseworker;\n\nKelly, an intervention specialist with Horace Mann Elementary School who had regular\n\ncontact with Charles and Connie and who had Connie in her class during fourth and fifth\n\ngrade; Mother\u2019s adult daughter, C.B.; Tina; Scott Burka, who had been the foster parent\n\nin Virginia for Charles and Connie for six months in 2011 and for all three children for\n\nabout 12 months in 2012 to 2013; Anthony Raterman, a counselor who treated Mother;\n\nand Mother.\n\n\n\n                             (1) R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) Factors\n\n                                  (a) The parents\u2019 wishes\n\n       {\u00b6 40} Mother wished to have custody of the children returned to her, but if that did\n\nnot occur, then she wanted the court to grant a temporary extension and unsupervised\n\nand overnight visitation at her home. Transcript of Proceedings (\u201cTr.\u201d), p. 244 and 245-\n\n255. Mother also did not want custody of Clark to be given to Y.I., because she did not\n\nwant the children separated. Id. at p. 247. Y.I. strongly wanted the children to remain\n\ntogether in Tina and David\u2019s home; if the court did not choose that route, he wanted\n\ncustody and was opposed to having Clark returned to Mother, as he did not want the risk\n\nof Clark being removed for a third time. Id. at p. 186.\n\f                                                                                       -15-\n\n\n      {\u00b6 41} E.J. had not seen Charles or Connie for at least five months before the\n\nhearing, and his wishes were unknown at the time of the hearing. Previously, E.J. told\n\nMCCS that he feared the children being returned to Mother and felt they were doing much\n\nbetter in their current situation. Id. at p. 197. This factor leaned toward leaving the\n\nchildren where they were.\n\n\n\n                                (b) The children\u2019s wishes\n\n      {\u00b6 42} There was no in-chambers interview of the children.           However, the\n\nchildren\u2019s attorney filed a notice with the court on March 13, 2020, indicating that while\n\nhe had missed the last custody hearing due to an emergency illness that landed him in\n\nthe hospital, his clients wished to remain in their current placement. Notice (March 13,\n\n2020), p. 1. The GAL did say in his last report that the two younger children had said\n\nthat they wished to live with their mother. GAL Report (March 6, 2020), p. 4. However,\n\nthe GAL also stated that:\n\n             The children have reported to various sources, including this GAL,\n\n      that their mother pressures them to say that they want to come back to live\n\n      with her. She has been seen asking questions and taking notes of their\n\n      answers with regard to this. This has reportedly been happening at the\n\n      end of every visit recently. The undersigned is very concerned that the\n\n      children are being put in the middle of a situation that they did not create\n\n      and should not be made to feel responsible for.\n\nId. at p. 5-6. This factor weighed against returning the children to Mother.\n\f                                                                                           -16-\n\n\n            (c) The children\u2019s interaction with parents, siblings, and others affecting\n\n                                   the children\u2019s best interest\n\n       {\u00b6 43} There is no question that the children love Mother and that she loves them.\n\nTr. at p. 26 and 160. Mother also had consistently visited with the children. Id. at p. 25,\n\n178, and 181. However, the children told both Beth, the caseworker, and Tina that while\n\nthey loved Mother and did not want to hurt her feelings, they were happy and wanted to\n\nstay where they felt safe. Id. at p. 27 and 117-118. Mother had also talked negatively\n\nto the children about the other adults in their lives, leaving the children in the middle. Id.\n\nat p. 40.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} The children were very close with their former foster family in Virginia (the\n\nBurkas), who had fostered the two eldest children for six months when Mother was\n\npregnant with Clark and for a year in 2012-2013 after Clark was born. Id. at p. 153, 158,\n\nand 259. After the children were returned to Mother and came to Ohio, the Burkas kept\n\nin contact. They visited, loaned money to Mother in 2018 so that she could have her\n\nelectricity turned back on, and kept the children for a month that summer to help Mother\n\nstabilize her situation (to no avail, as the children were removed in September 2018,\n\nbased on deplorable conditions in the home). Id. at p. 155-158.               During the court\n\nproceedings, the Burkas, Y.I., Tina, David, and the children all visited together when Tina\n\nand David took the children to Virginia during spring break. Id. at 31 and 159.           Mr.\n\nBurka described the relationship between all these people as \u201ca village that is helping\n\nraise these children.\u201d Id. at p. 159.\n\n       {\u00b6 45} Clark\u2019s father, Y.I., who lived in Virginia, visited Clark as often as he could,\n\nhad phone contact around three times a week with Clark, and had always been involved\n\f                                                                                      -17-\n\n\nwith all three children, not just with his own child.     Id. at p. 31, 70, 186, and 187.\n\nUnfortunately, despite MCCS\u2019s repeated efforts, the state of Virginia had refused to\n\nconduct a home study for Y.I.     Id. at p. 26, 71, and 185.\n\n      {\u00b6 46} Until the day of the final hearing in March 2020, Mother had \u201cconsistently\n\nand repeatedly\u201d said that once the children were returned to her, she would sever the\n\nchildren\u2019s relationships with the Burkas, with Tina and David, with the children\u2019s adult\n\nsister, C.B., and with Mother\u2019s sister, despite being made aware that the children cared\n\nfor these people and were afraid of that happening. Tr. at p. 34 and 180.    Mother also\n\ntold C.B. that she would not be allowed to see or speak with the children if they were\n\nreturned. Id. at p. 93.\n\n      {\u00b6 47} Finally, E.J. had sporadic contact with the children before they were\n\nremoved and had not seen them for several months before the final custody hearing. Id.\n\nat p. 182, 198 and 238.\n\n      {\u00b6 48} Depriving the children of supportive people who care about them and have\n\naided them in the past did not serve the children\u2019s best interest. Therefore, this factor\n\ndid not support giving Mother legal custody.\n\n\n\n           (d) The children's adjustment to the their home, school, and community\n\n      {\u00b6 49} Without question, the children were living in very bad circumstances before\n\nthey were removed.        Moreover, as indicated, Connie has special needs due to her\n\nautism. Connie\u2019s teacher, Kelly, testified at the hearing. Kelly, a teacher with 40 years\n\nof experience, is an intervention specialist who writes individualized education programs\n\n(IEPs) and sits in on IEP meetings. Tr. at p. 78-79. Kelly was familiar with both Clark\n\f                                                                                        -18-\n\n\nand Connie, and Connie was in Kelly\u2019s class for the fourth and fifth grades, during the\n\n2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. Id. In other words, Kelly had close contact\n\nwith Connie both before and after she was removed from Mother\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 50} Before the children were removed, Connie was often very late for school\n\nand wore clothes that were ill-fitting and not clean. Connie also had hygiene issues. Id.\n\nat p 79. Connie came to school with food and dirt on her face and had a very hard time\n\nmaking friends. In addition to having autism, Connie had attention deficit hyperactivity\n\ndisorder, for which she was not medicated. As a result, Connie could not pay attention\n\nor have conversations with other children.         Id. at p. 80.    Because of Connie\u2019s\n\nappearance, other children ostracized her and did not interact with her. They even asked\n\nnot to sit beside Connie because she did not smell good at times. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 51} Due to this situation, Kelly kept a hairbrush, a toothbrush, toothpaste and\n\nwipes at her desk, so that Connie could clean up before coming into class. Kelly also\n\nkept a detangler product in her desk because Connie\u2019s hair was tangled. The ill-fitting\n\nclothes and cleanliness were brought up during IEP meetings, but Mother blamed it on\n\nConnie. Id. at p. 79-81.       Mother said that Connie would not get up, did not take care\n\nof herself, and was going to have to deal with the consequences. Id. at p. 81. Clark\n\nalso came to school messy at times, but his hair was shorter. Id. at p. 82.\n\n       {\u00b6 52} After the children were removed, there was a \u201cnight and day difference. * * *\n\nThe children came in clean. They came in well rested. They didn\u2019t act like they were\n\ngoing to fall asleep.\u201d   Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Before the children were removed, Connie had more days that she was\n\ntardy than she was on time. Afterward, she had only excused tardiness or absence, like\n\f                                                                                        -19-\n\n\nfor doctor\u2019s appointments. Tr. at p. 85. Connie made great progress after removal; she\n\nwas getting her work done, was getting her medication regularly, had clothes that fit, was\n\nclean, and no longer had black circles under her eyes. Id. at p. 83 and 88. Kelly\n\ndescribed the children (Connie and Clark) after removal as being happy and like regular\n\nkids. Id. at p. 84.\n\n       {\u00b6 54} For the first few months after removal, the eldest child, Charles, lived with\n\nhis adult sister, C.B., and her husband. Id. at p. 96. During that time, Charles was\n\nhappy and seemed relieved. Id. Custody was then switched to Tina and David, due to\n\nfrustration and disagreements between Mother and C.B. Id. at p. 78, 86, 91, and 97.\n\nC.B. was calling the caseworker two or three times a week regarding various texting or\n\nverbal conflicts with Mother about Charles. Id. at p. 78.\n\n       {\u00b6 55} At the hearing, C.B. described her relationship with Mother as having been\n\nrocky her entire life. Id. at p. 90. C.B. indicated that when she lived with Mother, there\n\nwere similar issues with bugs, roaches, and cleanliness, which happened over and over\n\nagain. Id. at p. 91 and 96.\n\n       {\u00b6 56} Before being removed, Charles also had attendance issues and was\n\nacademically behind. Id. at p. 16 and 17-18.     Afterward, his attendance improved and\n\nhe made good progress in making up academic ground. Id. at p. 17-18.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} For the 2019-2020 school year, the children transferred to the local schools\n\nwhere Tina and David lived.      The children adjusted well, were happy at their new\n\nschools, and were doing well and making friends. Tr. at p. 16 and 67. Charles and\n\nConnie had been steadily improving at school, making up the deficits they had before\n\nbeing removed. Id. at p. 14, 15, 17-18, and 169.      Both Charles and Connie were also\n\f                                                                                         -20-\n\n\nin counseling, which was provided through their school. Id. at p. 169-170. In addition,\n\nthey were involved in extracurricular activities.     Id. at p. 16.    Clark had been in\n\ncounseling, but it was discontinued because the counselors did not feel he needed it. He\n\nwas also doing very well in school academically. Id. at p. 171.\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Moreover, while Mother did attend some extracurricular activities, she\n\ncaused conflict (up to the few months before the second custody hearing) by being hostile\n\ntoward the children\u2019s custodians. Mother had engaged in disruptive enough behavior\n\nthat the police trespassed her from the Beavercreek YMCA. Id. at p. 40-41, 101-106,\n\nand 112.    While the custodial parents originally attempted to include Mother in various\n\nevents, including coming into their home outside Mother\u2019s scheduled visitation time,\n\nMother\u2019s behavior and animosity became such that Tina discontinued this. Id. at 101-\n\n103.\n\n       {\u00b6 59} Finally, the GAL reported in his latest report that \u201cthe needs of the children\n\nare being met in their current placements, and they seem happy and well-adjusted. They\n\nhave blossomed in their current placement.\u201d GAL Report (March 6, 2020), at p. 7.\n\n       {\u00b6 60} Without question, this factor weighed against Mother. The children were\n\nsafer and happier and did much better at school after they were removed.\n\n\n\n                  (e) The mental and physical health of all persons involved\n\n       {\u00b6 61} Facts pertaining to this issue have been discussed above. Two of the\n\nchildren (Charles and Connie) had special needs that were being addressed after their\n\nremoval, and they were both in counseling (which they were not involved in before\n\nremoval). Mother had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and was taking\n\f                                                                                         -21-\n\n\nmedication. Tr. at p. 204, 214, and 253. By Mother\u2019s account, the medication was\n\nhelping. Id. at p. 253.\n\n       {\u00b6 62} No testimony was presented about the mental or physical health of E.J.,\n\nY.I., Tina, or David. This factor was essentially neutral.\n\n\n\n            (f) The parent more likely to honor and facilitate court-approved\n\n                parenting time rights or visitation and companionship rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 63} MCCS\u2019s caseworker indicated that Tina and David had been extremely\n\nflexible and open in working with all the adults in the children\u2019s lives and had facilitated\n\nrelationships between the children and their support networks. Tr. at p. 188. This is\n\nalso evident in the testimony related above. In contrast, Mother had indicated an intent\n\nnot to cooperate, both in her behavior and statements, despite a last-minute attempt to\n\nindicate otherwise. Mother's change of position with respect to severing the children's\n\nrelationships, made at the last hearing, contradicted what she had said during the entirety\n\nof the case and during the caseworker's last home visit, three weeks before the last\n\nhearing.   Id. at p. 34, 180 and 275-276.          Mother\u2019s statements, therefore, were\n\nunconvincing. Accordingly, this factor weighed against giving Mother legal custody of\n\nthe children.\n\n\n\n       (g) Whether either parent has failed to make all child support payments,\n\n       including all arrearages, that are required of that parent pursuant to a child\n\n                    support order under which that parent is an obligor\n\n       {\u00b6 64} At the time of the last custody hearing, Mother was current in her child\n\f                                                                                        -22-\n\n\nsupport payments. Due to her complaint that the support burden required her to work\n\ntoo much, the court reduced her support obligation. Id. at p. 245-246, and Order (June\n\n22, 2021), at p. 22. Y.I. had also paid his child support, and E.J. had not paid any child\n\nsupport. This factor was neutral with respect to Mother and Y.I., and was in Mother\u2019s\n\nfavor vis-\u00e0-vis E.J.\n\n\n\n                  (h) Convictions or Adjudications for Abuse or Neglect\n\n       {\u00b6 65} In this case, Mother had been adjudicated of having abused and neglected\n\nthe children due to her home\u2019s condition. Magistrate\u2019s Decision and Judge\u2019s Order (Jan.\n\n22, 2019), at p. 2, citing R.C. 2151.04(C), R.C. 2151.03(B), and R.C. 2151.03(A)(2). This\n\nfactor, therefore, weighed against granting legal custody to Mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 66} No evidence was presented concerning R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(i) and (j), and\n\nwe need not consider them. From the preceding discussion, it is clear that nearly all the\n\nfactors weighed against giving Mother legal custody and in favor of granting legal custody\n\nto Tina and David.\n\n\n\n                                (2) R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) Factors\n\n       {\u00b6 67} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) states that various factors should be considered in\n\ndeciding a child\u2019s best interest, and the juvenile court discussed these points as well. We\n\nwill briefly consider these matters.\n\n\n\n              (a) Interaction of those who may significantly affect the child\n\n       {\u00b6 68} We have already discussed this factor in connection with R.C.\n\f                                                                                       -23-\n\n\n3109.04(F)(1)(a) and need not consider it further.\n\n\n\n        (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through\n\n        the child's guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child\n\n      {\u00b6 69} We have already discussed this point, and this factor weighed against\n\ngranting Mother legal custody.\n\n\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been\n\n       in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies\n\n            or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a\n\n           consecutive twenty-two-month period, or the child has been in the\n\n         temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or\n\n       private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive\n\n        twenty-two-month period and, as described in division (D)(1) of section\n\n       2151.413 of the Revised Code, the child was previously in the temporary\n\n                    custody of an equivalent agency in another state\n\n      {\u00b6 70} As noted, Charles and Connie had previously been removed from Mother\u2019s\n\ncare for a total of 18 months in Virginia, and Clark had been removed from Mother\u2019s care\n\nfor about 12 months.      This factor weighed against Mother.        Notably, MCCS was\n\nparticularly concerned about Mother\u2019s ability to maintain progress and the impact of yet\n\nanother removal on the children. Tr. at p. 33, 176, 181, and 188.\n\n\n\n       (d) The child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that\n\f                                                                                          -24-\n\n\n        type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the\n\n                                              agency\n\n       {\u00b6 71} Although permanent custody is not being considered here, the juvenile court\n\nconsidered Mother\u2019s case plan in detail and found that Mother had completed some case\n\nplan   objectives    such   as    the   requirement     to   obtain   mental    health   and\n\npsychological/parenting assessments. However most of the rest of Mother\u2019s case plan\n\nobjectives were \u201congoing,\u201d and one objective (attending medical and educational\n\nappointments) was incomplete. Order (June 22, 2021), at p. 10-13. Consequently,\n\ncontrary to Mother\u2019s claim, she did not complete all her case plan requirements. The\n\ntestimony supported the court\u2019s conclusion. Tr. at p. 22, 24, 26, 176-177, 179, and181.\n\n       {\u00b6 72} Having reviewed the entire record, we agree that while Mother had made\n\nprogress on her case plan, there was reason for concern over whether her progress could\n\nbe sustained. In particular, some progress (such as refraining from conflict) was quite\n\nrecent, and other progress (like agreeing not to sever relationships that benefit the\n\nchildren) was, frankly, not credible. Furthermore, Mother had a long history of having\n\nher children removed and of having parenting and cleanliness issues. In contrast, the\n\nperiod of progress had been brief.\n\n\n\n         (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section\n\n                         apply in relation to the parents and child\n\n       {\u00b6 73} These factors involve matters like convictions for certain crimes involving a\n\nsibling or a child living in a parent\u2019s household, refusal of medical treatment or food to the\n\nchild, placing the child in substantial harm due to alcohol or drug abuse, abandonment of\n\f                                                                                         -25-\n\n\nthe child, and prior termination of parental rights to a sibling of the child. The juvenile\n\ncourt did not find that any of these factors applied to Mother, but it did conclude that E.J.\n\nhad abandoned Charles and Connie by failing to visit with them for the preceding 90 days\n\nand by failing to contact MCCS. This finding was well-supported in the record.\n\n       {\u00b6 74} Finally, the juvenile court concluded that MCCS had made reasonable\n\nefforts to prevent the children\u2019s removal, to eliminate the continued removal, or to make\n\nit possible for the children to safely return. Order (July 22, 2021), at p. 15-16. Again,\n\nwe agree with the court.\n\n       {\u00b6 75} Based on the preceding discussion, we reject Mother\u2019s arguments and find\n\nno error by the juvenile court.      Accordingly, Mother\u2019s sole assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 76} The judgment of the juvenile court is affirmed.\n\n                                      .............\n\n\n\nTUCKER, P.J. and DONOVAN, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H.

HECK, JR., by HEATHER N. KETTER, Atty. Reg. No. 0084470, Assistant\nProsecuting Attorney, Montgomery County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Appellate Division,\nMontgomery County Courts Building, 301 West Third Street, Dayton, Ohio 45422\n      Attorney for Appellee, Montgomery County Children Services\n\nROBERT ALAN BRENNER, Atty. Reg. No. 0067714, P.O. Box 340214, Dayton, Ohio\n45422\n      Attorney for Appellant, Mother\n\n                                         .............\n\n\n\nWELBAUM, J.\n\f                                                                                       -2-\n\n\n\n\n      {\u00b6 1} Mother appeals from a juvenile court judgment awarding legal custody of her\n\nthree children, Charles, Connie, and Clark, to non-relative care-givers, Tina and David.1\n\nIn her sole assignment of error, Mother contends that the juvenile court erred in awarding\n\ncustody to Tina and David because, at the time of the second custody hearing, two of the\n\nchildren (Connie and Clark) wished to return home to Mother. In addition, Mother argues\n\nthat she had completed her case plan requirements.\n\n      {\u00b6 2} After considering the record and applicable law, we conclude that Mother\u2019s\n\nassignment of error is without merit. Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment will be\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                             I. Facts and Course of Proceedings\n\n      {\u00b6 3} In this appeal, three dockets were submitted, one for each child. Because\n\nthe dockets are essentially the same, we will refer to the docket in Case No. 2018-5509,\n\nwhich is the docket for the eldest child, Charles. We note that Charles and Connie have\n\nthe same father (E.J.), and Clark\u2019s father is Y.I. Neither father has appealed from the\n\nlegal custody award.\n\n      {\u00b6 4} In early November 2018, Montgomery County Children Services (\u201cMCCS\u201d)\n\nfiled complaints based on abuse, neglect, and dependency involving the three children.\n\n\n\n1 To avoid excessive use of initials, which can become confusing, we will refer to C.T.1,\nC.T.2, and C.T.3, respectively, as Charles, Connie, and Clark. These are not their real\nnames. The birth years of the children, respectively, are 2006, 2007, and 2012. At the\ntime of the juvenile court\u2019s legal custody award in June 2021, the children were ages 14,\n13, and nine years old. We will also refer to the legal custodians as Tina and David.\nAgain, these are not the real names.\n\f                                                                                        -3-\n\n\nThis was a refiling of prior complaints that could not be adjudicated within the statutory\n\ntime.\n\n        {\u00b6 5} According to the complaint in Charles\u2019s case, MCCS received a referral on\n\nSeptember 4, 2018, alleging that Mother\u2019s house was in a deplorable condition and that\n\nthere were concerns about Mother\u2019s lack of supervision of the children and the lack of\n\nutilities. Complaint (Nov. 21, 2018), p. 1.\n\n        {\u00b6 6} After some difficulty making contact with Mother, MCCS caseworker Beth,\n\ncalled the police and was able to enter Mother\u2019s house with Mother\u2019s permission on\n\nSeptember 5, 2018. When Beth entered the home, there was an overwhelming smell.\n\nBeth and the officers observed trash, clutter, old food, clothing, and other items, and the\n\nhouse was infested with roaches. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 2</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The refrigerator did not work, did not\n\ncontain any food, and was also filled with roaches. While the freezer contained food, it\n\ndid not work, also had roaches, and the food was rotting.        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">   In addition, Mother\n\nadmitted that she worked third shift and had left the children unattended in the home while\n\nshe was at work. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> At the time of their removal, Charles was 12 years old; Connie\n\nwas 10 years old, and Clark was six years old.\n\n        {\u00b6 7} Charles was placed with an adult sister, C.B., on a safety plan. However,\n\nshe was unable to care for all the children.      Because MCCS was unsuccessful in\n\nestablishing a safety plan for the two other children, the police had to place them in\n\nMCCS\u2019s custody.

According to the case plan, Mother had been working with\n\nEastway Behavioral Health for mental health services but was resistant to treatment\n\nrecommendations. In June 2019, Mother decided to change to Patterson Park Health\n\nCenter. Multiple parties had reported that Mother had increasing struggles with her\n\nbehavior and interaction with others, and she had openly stated her intent to terminate\n\nthe children\u2019s relationship with family members and others because she perceived she\n\nhad been \u201cdone wrong\u201d by them.

Mother also requested unsupervised visitation. The GAL\n\nthen submitted another report on October 2, 2019. The GAL noted that while Mother\n\nhad made considerable progress on several fronts, he could not recommend returning\n\ncustody to Mother at that time.       GAL Report (Sept. 27, 2019), p. 9.

The magistrate also set a dispositional\n\nhearing for December 4, 2019.        Subsequently, in mid-October 2019, MCCS filed a\n\nmotion to show cause against E.J., because he had not paid child support as ordered.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} After the dispositional hearing was held, the magistrate filed an order on\n\nDecember 5, 2019, continuing MCCS\u2019s protective supervision and granting Mother two\n\nhours of supervised visitation per week. The matter was then continued until March 6,\n\n2020, because the dispositional hearing had not yet concluded. Following a contempt\n\nhearing on January 9, 2020, E.J. was held in contempt and was sentenced to 30 days in\n\njail, with the sentence being suspended on the condition that he pay support.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} On March 9, 2020, the GAL filed another report, based on his most recent\n\nvisitation with Mother and the children.

Mother had very little family support and a long\n\nhistory of problems. GAL Report (March 9, 2020), p. 6.         Mother also minimized the\n\nconditions causing removal and indicated that she would minimize contact with other\n\nfamily members and Tina and David if she received custody. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 6-7</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The GAL\n\nwas concerned that the children would be isolated, especially at a time when they were\n\nmost vulnerable. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 7</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Due to these concerns, the fact that the children had\n\n\u201cbloomed\u201d in their current situation, Mother\u2019s lack of insight and prior actions indicating\n\nthat her mental health and parenting skills were questionable, and concern over whether\n\nMother could maintain her current path, the GAL recommended that Tina and David\n\nreceive legal custody and that Mother be allowed expanded visitation. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       {\u00b6 25} The dispositional hearing continued on March 6, 2020.

On\n\nMarch 5, 2021, MCCS filed a SAR indicating that Mother was not working due to back\n\nsurgery in November 2020.

Like the magistrate, the court granted progressive parenting time, contingent\n\non Mother\u2019s refraining from creating turmoil or conflict with the children or the custodians.\n\nBoth fathers were given parenting time as agreed to by the parties.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} Mother then timely appealed from the juvenile court\u2019s judgment.

We will do the same, focusing on the hearing testimony in\n\naddition to the record as outlined above, and the particular factors that are pertinent here.\n\nThe individuals who testified at the two hearings included: Beth, the MCCS caseworker;\n\nKelly, an intervention specialist with Horace Mann Elementary School who had regular\n\ncontact with Charles and Connie and who had Connie in her class during fourth and fifth\n\ngrade; Mother\u2019s adult daughter, C.B.; Tina; Scott Burka, who had been the foster parent\n\nin Virginia for Charles and Connie for six months in 2011 and for all three children for\n\nabout 12 months in 2012 to 2013; Anthony Raterman, a counselor who treated Mother;\n\nand Mother.\n\n\n\n                             (1) R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) Factors\n\n                                  (a) The parents\u2019 wishes\n\n       {\u00b6 40} Mother wished to have custody of the children returned to her, but if that did\n\nnot occur, then she wanted the court to grant a temporary extension and unsupervised\n\nand overnight visitation at her home.

Mother also did not want custody of Clark to be given to Y.I., because she did not\n\nwant the children separated. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 247</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Y.I. strongly wanted the children to remain\n\ntogether in Tina and David\u2019s home; if the court did not choose that route, he wanted\n\ncustody and was opposed to having Clark returned to Mother, as he did not want the risk\n\nof Clark being removed for a third time. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 186</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\f                                                                                       -15-\n\n\n      {\u00b6 41} E.J. had not seen Charles or Connie for at least five months before the\n\nhearing, and his wishes were unknown at the time of the hearing. Previously, E.J. told\n\nMCCS that he feared the children being returned to Mother and felt they were doing much\n\nbetter in their current situation. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 197</span><pre class=\"inline\">. This factor leaned toward leaving the\n\nchildren where they were.\n\n\n\n                                (b) The children\u2019s wishes\n\n      {\u00b6 42} There was no in-chambers interview of the children.           However, the\n\nchildren\u2019s attorney filed a notice with the court on March 13, 2020, indicating that while\n\nhe had missed the last custody hearing due to an emergency illness that landed him in\n\nthe hospital, his clients wished to remain in their current placement. Notice (March 13,\n\n2020), p. 1. The GAL did say in his last report that the two younger children had said\n\nthat they wished to live with their mother. GAL Report (March 6, 2020), p. 4. However,\n\nthe GAL also stated that:\n\n             The children have reported to various sources, including this GAL,\n\n      that their mother pressures them to say that they want to come back to live\n\n      with her. She has been seen asking questions and taking notes of their\n\n      answers with regard to this. This has reportedly been happening at the\n\n      end of every visit recently. The undersigned is very concerned that the\n\n      children are being put in the middle of a situation that they did not create\n\n      and should not be made to feel responsible for.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 5-6</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Mother also had consistently visited with the children. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 25,\n\n178,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and 181. However, the children told both Beth, the caseworker, and Tina that while\n\nthey loved Mother and did not want to hurt her feelings, they were happy and wanted to\n\nstay where they felt safe. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 27</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and 117-118. Mother had also talked negatively\n\nto the children about the other adults in their lives, leaving the children in the middle. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\n\nat p. 40</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} The children were very close with their former foster family in Virginia (the\n\nBurkas), who had fostered the two eldest children for six months when Mother was\n\npregnant with Clark and for a year in 2012-2013 after Clark was born. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 153, 158,</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nand 259. After the children were returned to Mother and came to Ohio, the Burkas kept\n\nin contact.

Moreover, as indicated, Connie has special needs due to her\n\nautism. Connie\u2019s teacher, Kelly, testified at the hearing. Kelly, a teacher with 40 years\n\nof experience, is an intervention specialist who writes individualized education programs\n\n(IEPs) and sits in on IEP meetings. Tr. at p. 78-79. Kelly was familiar with both Clark\n\f                                                                                        -18-\n\n\nand Connie, and Connie was in Kelly\u2019s class for the fourth and fifth grades, during the\n\n2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> In other words, Kelly had close contact\n\nwith Connie both before and after she was removed from Mother\u2019s home.\n\n       {\u00b6 50} Before the children were removed, Connie was often very late for school\n\nand wore clothes that were ill-fitting and not clean. Connie also had hygiene issues. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\n\nat p 79</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Connie came to school with food and dirt on her face and had a very hard time\n\nmaking friends. In addition to having autism, Connie had attention deficit hyperactivity\n\ndisorder, for which she was not medicated. As a result, Connie could not pay attention\n\nor have conversations with other children.         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 80</span><pre class=\"inline\">.    Because of Connie\u2019s\n\nappearance, other children ostracized her and did not interact with her. They even asked\n\nnot to sit beside Connie because she did not smell good at times. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       {\u00b6 51} Due to this situation, Kelly kept a hairbrush, a toothbrush, toothpaste and\n\nwipes at her desk, so that Connie could clean up before coming into class. Kelly also\n\nkept a detangler product in her desk because Connie\u2019s hair was tangled. The ill-fitting\n\nclothes and cleanliness were brought up during IEP meetings, but Mother blamed it on\n\nConnie. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 79-81</span><pre class=\"inline\">.       Mother said that Connie would not get up, did not take care\n\nof herself, and was going to have to deal with the consequences. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 81</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The children adjusted well, were happy at their new\n\nschools, and were doing well and making friends. Tr. at p. 16 and 67. Charles and\n\nConnie had been steadily improving at school, making up the deficits they had before\n\nbeing removed. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 14, 15, 17-18,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and 169.      Both Charles and Connie were also\n\f                                                                                         -20-\n\n\nin counseling, which was provided through their school. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 169-170</span><pre class=\"inline\">.

He\n\nwas also doing very well in school academically. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 171</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Moreover, while Mother did attend some extracurricular activities, she\n\ncaused conflict (up to the few months before the second custody hearing) by being hostile\n\ntoward the children\u2019s custodians. Mother had engaged in disruptive enough behavior\n\nthat the police trespassed her from the Beavercreek YMCA. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 40-41, 101-106,</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nand 112.    While the custodial parents originally attempted to include Mother in various\n\nevents, including coming into their home outside Mother\u2019s scheduled visitation time,\n\nMother\u2019s behavior and animosity became such that Tina discontinued this. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 101</span><pre class=\"inline\">-\n\n103.\n\n       {\u00b6 59} Finally, the GAL reported in his latest report that \u201cthe needs of the children\n\nare being met in their current placements, and they seem happy and well-adjusted. They\n\nhave blossomed in their current placement.\u201d GAL Report (March 6, 2020), at p. 7.\n\n       {\u00b6 60} Without question, this factor weighed against Mother. The children were\n\nsafer and happier and did much better at school after they were removed.\n\n\n\n                  (e) The mental and physical health of all persons involved\n\n       {\u00b6 61} Facts pertaining to this issue have been discussed above. Two of the\n\nchildren (Charles and Connie) had special needs that were being addressed after their\n\nremoval, and they were both in counseling (which they were not involved in before\n\nremoval). Mother had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and was taking\n\f                                                                                         -21-\n\n\nmedication. Tr. at p. 204, 214, and 253. By Mother\u2019s account, the medication was\n\nhelping. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 253</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       {\u00b6 62} No testimony was presented about the mental or physical health of E.J.,\n\nY.I., Tina, or David. This factor was essentially neutral.\n\n\n\n            (f) The parent more likely to honor and facilitate court-approved\n\n                parenting time rights or visitation and companionship rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 63} MCCS\u2019s caseworker indicated that Tina and David had been extremely\n\nflexible and open in working with all the adults in the children\u2019s lives and had facilitated\n\nrelationships between the children and their support networks. Tr. at p. 188. This is\n\nalso evident in the testimony related above. In contrast, Mother had indicated an intent\n\nnot to cooperate, both in her behavior and statements, despite a last-minute attempt to\n\nindicate otherwise. Mother's change of position with respect to severing the children's\n\nrelationships, made at the last hearing, contradicted what she had said during the entirety\n\nof the case and during the caseworker's last home visit, three weeks before the last\n\nhearing.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at p. 34, 180</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and 275-276.          Mother\u2019s statements, therefore, were\n\nunconvincing. Accordingly, this factor weighed against giving Mother legal custody of\n\nthe children.\n\n\n\n       (g) Whether either parent has failed to make all child support payments,\n\n       including all arrearages, that are required of that parent pursuant to a child\n\n                    support order under which that parent is an obligor\n\n       {\u00b6 64} At the time of the last custody hearing, Mother was current in her child\n\f                                                                                        -22-\n\n\nsupport payments.

Y.I. had also paid his child support, and E.J. had not paid any child\n\nsupport. This factor was neutral with respect to Mother and Y.I., and was in Mother\u2019s\n\nfavor vis-\u00e0-vis E.J.\n\n\n\n                  (h) Convictions or Adjudications for Abuse or Neglect\n\n       {\u00b6 65} In this case, Mother had been adjudicated of having abused and neglected\n\nthe children due to her home\u2019s condition.

This\n\nfactor, therefore, weighed against granting legal custody to Mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 66} No evidence was presented concerning R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(i) and (j), and\n\nwe need not consider them. From the preceding discussion, it is clear that nearly all the\n\nfactors weighed against giving Mother legal custody and in favor of granting legal custody\n\nto Tina and David.\n\n\n\n                                (2) R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) Factors\n\n       {\u00b6 67} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) states that various factors should be considered in\n\ndeciding a child\u2019s best interest, and the juvenile court discussed these points as well. We\n\nwill briefly consider these matters.\n\n\n\n              (a) Interaction of those who may significantly affect the child\n\n       {\u00b6 68} We have already discussed this factor in connection with R.C.\n\f                                                                                       -23-\n\n\n3109.04(F)(1)(a) and need not consider it further.\n\n\n\n        (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through\n\n        the child's guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child\n\n      {\u00b6 69} We have already discussed this point, and this factor weighed against\n\ngranting Mother legal custody.\n\n\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been\n\n       in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies\n\n            or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a\n\n           consecutive twenty-two-month period, or the child has been in the\n\n         temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or\n\n       private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive\n\n        twenty-two-month period and, as described in division (D)(1) of section\n\n       2151.413 of the Revised Code, the child was previously in the temporary\n\n                    custody of an equivalent agency in another state\n\n      {\u00b6 70} As noted, Charles and Connie had previously been removed from Mother\u2019s\n\ncare for a total of 18 months in Virginia, and Clark had been removed from Mother\u2019s care\n\nfor about 12 months.      This factor weighed against Mother.        Notably, MCCS was\n\nparticularly concerned about Mother\u2019s ability to maintain progress and the impact of yet\n\nanother removal on the children. Tr. at p. 33, 176, 181, and 188.\n\n\n\n       (d) The child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that\n\f                                                                                          -24-\n\n\n        type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the\n\n                                              agency\n\n       {\u00b6 71} Although permanent custody is not being considered here, the juvenile court\n\nconsidered Mother\u2019s case plan in detail and found that Mother had completed some case\n\nplan   objectives    such   as    the   requirement     to   obtain   mental    health   and\n\npsychological/parenting assessments. However most of the rest of Mother\u2019s case plan\n\nobjectives were \u201congoing,\u201d and one objective (attending medical and educational\n\nappointments) was incomplete. Order (June 22, 2021), at p. 10-13. Consequently,\n\ncontrary to Mother\u2019s claim, she did not complete all her case plan requirements. The\n\ntestimony supported the court\u2019s conclusion. Tr. at p. 22, 24, 26, 176-177, 179, and181.\n\n       {\u00b6 72} Having reviewed the entire record, we agree that while Mother had made\n\nprogress on her case plan, there was reason for concern over whether her progress could\n\nbe sustained. In particular, some progress (such as refraining from conflict) was quite\n\nrecent, and other progress (like agreeing not to sever relationships that benefit the\n\nchildren) was, frankly, not credible. Furthermore, Mother had a long history of having\n\nher children removed and of having parenting and cleanliness issues. In contrast, the\n\nperiod of progress had been brief.\n\n\n\n         (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section\n\n                         apply in relation to the parents and child\n\n       {\u00b6 73} These factors involve matters like convictions for certain crimes involving a\n\nsibling or a child living in a parent\u2019s household, refusal of medical treatment or food to the\n\nchild, placing the child in substantial harm due to alcohol or drug abuse, abandonment of\n\f                                                                                         -25-\n\n\nthe child, and prior termination of parental rights to a sibling of the child. The juvenile\n\ncourt did not find that any of these factors applied to Mother, but it did conclude that E.J.\n\nhad abandoned Charles and Connie by failing to visit with them for the preceding 90 days\n\nand by failing to contact MCCS. This finding was well-supported in the record.\n\n       {\u00b6 74} Finally, the juvenile court concluded that MCCS had made reasonable\n\nefforts to prevent the children\u2019s removal, to eliminate the continued removal, or to make\n\nit possible for the children to safely return. Order (July 22, 2021), at p. 15-16. Again,\n\nwe agree with the court.\n\n       {\u00b6 75} Based on the preceding discussion, we reject Mother\u2019s arguments and find\n\nno error by the juvenile court.      Accordingly, Mother\u2019s sole assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 76} The judgment of the juvenile court is affirmed.\n\n                                      .............\n\n\n\nTUCKER, P.J. and DONOVAN, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H.

NOETZEL,\n                            Appellant,\n\n                                   v.\n\n                        STATE OF FLORIDA,\n                             Appellee.\n\n                         November 10, 2021\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n     Barry A. Noetzel appeals his judgment of conviction of first-\n\ndegree murder and sentence of death. We have jurisdiction, see\n\nart. V, \u00a7 3(b)(1), Fla. Const., and for the reasons below affirm\n\nNoetzel\u2019s conviction and sentence of death.\n\n                           BACKGROUND\n\n     While serving a life sentence at Mayo Correctional Institution,\n\nNoetzel joined with his cellmate, Jesse Bell, in developing a plan to\n\nmurder corrections officer James Newman, whom they disliked, and\n\na fellow inmate, whom they would select at a later date. They\n\freduced their plan to writing in the following twelve steps, which\n\nthey titled \u201cCountdown To Extention\u201d [sic]:\n\n     1. Get on vegan diet\n     2. Get multiple tools\n     3. Get diagram of area\n     4. Find a gofer\n     5. Baby powder?\n     6. Patience!!!!\n     7. Pick a dick sucker\n     8. Background check on dick sucker\n     9. Pick a date\n     10. Commence dry runs - rehearsals\n     11. Exicute [sic]!\n     12. Work on spelling!!\n\n     In accordance with their plan, Noetzel and Bell got on a vegan\n\ndiet, which allowed them greater access to the area of the kitchen\n\nwhere Officer Newman worked. They used other inmates to scout\n\nthe layout of the kitchen, drew a diagram of the area where Officer\n\nNewman worked, and obtained pieces of metal and fence, which\n\nthey sharpened into weapons. They also selected their fellow\n\ninmate Donald H. Eastwood, Jr., to kill because they believed him\n\nto be homosexual and a child molester.\n\n     On June 26, 2019, after Noetzel lured Eastwood to his and\n\nBell\u2019s cell, Noetzel stabbed Eastwood in the eyes using their\n\nhomemade weapons while Bell restrained and manually choked\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fEastwood. Noetzel hung up a sheet to prevent anyone from seeing\n\ninside the cell, and after confirming Eastwood was dead, Noetzel\n\nand Bell covered Eastwood\u2019s body with a blanket and hid the body\n\nunder a bunk in the cell. They also cleaned up Eastwood\u2019s blood\n\nwith a towel and hung up a note in their cell that read, \u201cGOD\n\nHATES FAGS[.] FAGS HATE GOD! KILL ALL FAGS AND CHO-\n\nMOES! (And Any C.O.\u2019s Who F*ck with You!).\u201d\n\n     Noetzel and Bell then went to the prison\u2019s dining area, where\n\nthey attempted to stab Officer Newman to death with another of\n\ntheir homemade weapons. Other officers intervened in the attack\n\non Officer Newman, who was seriously injured but survived;\n\napprehended Noetzel and Bell in the dining hall; and discovered\n\nEastwood\u2019s body in Noetzel and Bell\u2019s cell, after Bell told a\n\ncorrections officer that there was a dead \u201cchomo\u201d in his cell, with\n\n\u201cchomo\u201d being prison slang for \u201cchild molester.\u201d\n\n     Both Noetzel and Bell subsequently waived their Miranda 1\n\nrights and provided detailed confessions to law enforcement. As the\n\n\n\n\n     1. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftrial court\u2019s sentencing order accurately reflects, with respect to the\n\nfirst-degree murder of Eastwood, Noetzel\n\n     admitted that, after luring Mr. Eastwood to [the] cell\n     [Noetzel shared with Bell], [Noetzel] stabbed Mr.\n     Eastwood in the left eye, and his codefendant [Bell]\n     grabbed Mr. Eastwood from behind and began to \u201cchoke\n     him out.\u201d Mr. Eastwood did not immediately die, so\n     [Noetzel] attempted to stab him in the right eye while\n     [Bell] continued to \u201cchoke out\u201d Mr. Eastwood. At some\n     point during the attack, Mr. Eastwood began to question\n     the attack or beg for his life. Additionally, when [Bell]\n     initially released tension on Mr. Eastwood\u2019s neck, Mr.\n     Eastwood seemingly gasped for air. This caused [Bell] to\n     continue to strangle Mr. Eastwood even after he fell to\n     the ground. Eventually, Mr. Eastwood succumbed to\n     these injuries and died.\n\n     Consistent with Noetzel\u2019s description of the killing, the medical\n\nexaminer testified that Eastwood\u2019s cause of death was \u201csharp force\n\ntrauma to the left eye and brain[,] with neck compression,\u201d that the\n\nmanner of death was homicide, and that the puncture wound to\n\nEastwood\u2019s left eye\u2014which was \u201cbadly wounded\u201d and \u201cbasically just\n\na bloody pulp\u201d\u2014would have been \u201cparticularly painful.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel and Bell were jointly indicted on October 29, 2019, in\n\na five-count indictment for the first-degree premeditated murder of\n\nEastwood; the attempted first-degree murder of Officer Newman\n\nwith a weapon; and conspiracy to commit the first-degree murder of\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fOfficer Newman. In the fourth and fifth counts, Noetzel and Bell\n\nwere each indicted, respectively, on one count of possession of a\n\nweapon by an inmate.\n\n Noetzel Requests to Exercise His Right to Self-Representation\n                      and to Plead Guilty\n\n     At Noetzel\u2019s first appearance and arraignment, after appointed\n\ncounsel entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf, Noetzel personally\n\naddressed the trial court, stating that he would like a speedy trial,\n\nthat he \u201cwant[ed] to enter a plea of guilty right now,\u201d and that he\n\nwanted to represent himself and waive his right to counsel. The\n\npresiding judge informed Noetzel that he was filling in for the trial\n\njudge, and that it would be up to the assigned judge to conduct the\n\nFaretta 2 hearing required by Noetzel\u2019s unequivocal request for self-\n\nrepresentation. The presiding judge also told Noetzel, \u201c[I]f you want\n\nto put that in writing, that you want to represent yourself, by all\n\nmeans, do that,\u201d so that the assigned judge could \u201cconsider [it] at\n\nthe appropriate time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n     2. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f     Thereafter, Noetzel put his pro se requests in writing, filing a\n\ndemand for speedy trial, a motion to proceed pro se, and a motion\n\nto discharge appointed counsel. Noetzel then filed a pro se \u201cnotice\n\nof inquiry\u201d and a pro se motion to compel a hearing. In addition,\n\nNoetzel filed a pro se letter questioning why no hearing had been\n\nheld on his motion to proceed pro se; in the letter, Noetzel reiterated\n\nthat he had \u201cattempted to enter a plea of guilty on all charges\u201d at\n\nhis arraignment. Noetzel\u2019s pro se letter explained his strategy:\n\n          I fully understand the dictates of Faretta and am\n     knowingly and intelligently waiving my right to counsel.\n     Thereafter, I will be entering a plea of guilty to preserve\n     judicial resources and bring closure to all parties\n     concerned with the outcome of this case.\n\n     Following Noetzel\u2019s pro se filings, three proceedings relevant to\n\nthe issues raised in this appeal occurred: (1) a motion hearing, at\n\nwhich the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation, found Noetzel competent, and accepted Noetzel\u2019s\n\nguilty plea, (2) a bench penalty-phase proceeding that occurred\n\nafter an expert evaluated Noetzel and found him competent, and (3)\n\na final penalty-phase hearing that occurred after the presentence\n\ninvestigation (PSI).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fI. THE MOTION HEARING\n\n     The Trial Court Conducts a Faretta Inquiry and Grants\n           Noetzel\u2019s Request for Self-Representation\n\n     On January 21, 2020, the trial judge assigned to Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncase held a hearing on Noetzel\u2019s pro se motions. At the hearing,\n\nNoetzel personally addressed the court and listed his requests,\n\nnamely that he wished to discharge counsel, represent himself,\n\nenter a plea of guilty on all charges, demand a speedy trial, \u201cwaive\n\nall [of his] rights to a jury,\u201d and be sentenced by the trial court.\n\n     The trial court first addressed Noetzel\u2019s request to invoke his\n\nright to self-representation by conducting a Faretta inquiry. The\n\nlengthy inquiry included explanations by the trial court of the\n\nadvantages of counsel and the disadvantages of self-representation,\n\nall of which Noetzel indicated that he understood. Noetzel\u2019s\n\nresponses to the trial court\u2019s questions went beyond simple \u201cyeses\u201d\n\nand \u201cnoes.\u201d For example, in response to the trial court\u2019s question\n\nas to whether Noetzel had \u201cany questions about the dangers and\n\ndisadvantages of representing [himself]\u201d that the trial court had\n\nexplained, Noetzel responded, \u201cOh, what does it say, a lawyer that\n\nrepresents himself has a fool for a client.\u201d Noetzel then stated that\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhe was \u201cstill prepared to go forward with it,\u201d even though he\n\nunderstood it was \u201c[c]ompletely inadvisable\u201d to proceed on his own.\n\nIn response to follow-up questions by the trial court as to why he\n\nwanted to represent himself despite knowing it was inadvisable to\n\ndo so, Noetzel explained that he wanted to quickly plead guilty\n\nbecause, \u201cI am guilty. There\u2019s no, if and buts about it. I did what I\n\ndid. Got no problem with it.\u201d 3\n\n     During the Faretta inquiry, the trial court also questioned\n\nNoetzel as to whether he had \u201cever been diagnosed and/or treated\n\nfor any mental illness or disorder.\u201d Noetzel responded,\n\n\u201cDepression.\u201d The trial court followed up by asking Noetzel if he\n\nwas taking any medication, and when Noetzel said he was not \u201cat\n\nthis moment,\u201d the trial court questioned whether Noetzel had been\n\nprescribed medication. When Noetzel said yes, the trial court asked\n\n\n\n\n      3. Other examples of Noetzel\u2019s level of engagement with the\ntrial court during the Faretta inquiry include that Noetzel appeared\nto banter with the trial court in discussing the potential deportation\nconsequences of a guilty plea or conviction, stating \u201cI really like the\nUnited States of America, sir,\u201d and in discussing the possible\nconsequences of a conviction if a sex-offender statute applied to any\nof his prior convictions, stating, \u201cI like that law and I don\u2019t fall\nunder it.\u201d\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fNoetzel to explain why he was not taking his prescribed medication,\n\nand Noetzel said that he \u201cwanted to have a clear mind before I got to\n\nthis point.\u201d Then, the following exchange occurred between Noetzel\n\nand the trial court:\n\n            THE COURT: Okay. Does the medication cloud\n     your mind?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir, but I just wanted to\n     make sure I didn\u2019t have anything in my system because I\n     knew that this was going to be one of the questions that\n     would be asked.\n            THE COURT: All right. So does the medication help\n     you to understand or hinder your ability to understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT: It\u2019s a low grade -- I don\u2019t\n     remember the name of it, it\u2019s in my file, for depression,\n     but it\u2019s also for back pain because I have chronic back\n     pain, but because it\u2019s a psych med, it\u2019s registered that\n     way.\n            THE COURT: All right. . . . [T]hen I assume, if\n     there is an effect, it would cloud your ability to\n     understand, affect your ability negatively to understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n            THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n            THE COURT: Does it enhance your ability to\n     understand, the medication?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, it just kind of keeps me\n     calm.\n            THE COURT: Okay. But --\n            THE DEFENDANT: There\u2019s no positive or negative\n     to it except for what I take for my back.\n            THE COURT: But it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to\n     understand or comprehend anything about what\u2019s taking\n     place?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f           THE COURT: Do you feel that you\u2019re fully capable\n     currently as you sit here now without your medication to\n     understand and comprehend everything that you and I\n     are talking about?\n           THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n     The trial court then moved on to additional lines of inquiry,\n\nincluding whether, if Noetzel were permitted to represent himself,\n\nhe would accept standby counsel. After the trial court explained\n\nthe role of standby counsel, Noetzel said he understood and\n\nconfirmed his desire for standby counsel.\n\n     Before ruling on Noetzel\u2019s request for self-representation, the\n\ntrial court inquired of the State and Noetzel\u2019s then-appointed\n\ndefense counsel as to whether either suggested further lines of\n\ninquiry. Defense counsel suggested that the trial court should use\n\nthe procedure followed in another recent capital case, where the\n\ntrial court \u201cappointed a couple of doctors to evaluate [the defendant]\n\nto make sure that he was competent to make the decisions to\n\nrepresent himself.\u201d Counsel\u2019s suggestion prompted the following\n\nexchange:\n\n          THE COURT: Okay. And there\u2019s no reason, though,\n     to do that before the Court making a determination\n     whether Mr. Noetzel understands what\u2019s taking place\n     here today in his request to represent himself?\n\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f           [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I\u2019ve not seen any\n     reason personally to doubt that Mr. Noetzel is competent\n     to make the decision to represent himself, but I\u2019m not an\n     expert.\n           THE COURT: Certainly. And I understand that.\n     Mr. Noetzel, what [counsel] is saying and what I\u2019m going\n     to do, whether I allow you to represent yourself at this\n     stage or not, is appoint an expert to have you evaluated\n     just to ensure. I don\u2019t see any reason to believe in any\n     way that you\u2019re incompetent to proceed.\n           THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, sir.\n           THE COURT: But I\u2019m going to have that evaluation\n     done out of the abundance of caution because of the\n     severity of the possible sentences here. Do you\n     understand that?\n           THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n     Following this exchange, the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s\n\nrequest for self-representation and appointed the public defender\u2019s\n\noffice as standby counsel.\n\n  The Trial Court Makes Additional Findings Regarding Self-\nRepresentation, Renews the Offer of Counsel, Accepts Noetzel\u2019s\n          Guilty Plea, and Finds Noetzel Competent\n\n     Immediately after ruling that Noetzel could represent himself,\n\nthe trial court addressed Noetzel\u2019s request \u201cto either demand a\n\nspeedy trial or enter a plea,\u201d and explained to Noetzel that he could\n\ndemand a speedy trial if he wanted to go to trial, but that if he\n\nwanted to plead guilty, he would be \u201cgiving up [his] right to a trial.\u201d\n\nNoetzel stated, \u201cI would like to plead guilty.\u201d The trial court then\n\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\frecessed so that Noetzel could read the offer of plea that the State\n\nhad prepared. When the hearing resumed, the State represented\n\nthat Noetzel had read and signed the offer of plea form.\n\n     Before addressing Noetzel\u2019s plea, the trial court made the\n\nfollowing, additional ruling with respect to Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation:\n\n          Mr. Noetzel, I already advised you, if I didn\u2019t, that\n     I\u2019m going to allow you to represent yourself. Mr.\n     Marshburn and his office, the Office of the Public\n     Defender, will be appointed at your request only as\n     standby counsel and that the decisions that you\u2019ll be\n     making with [sic] be yours. If you have any questions\n     you don\u2019t want to ask me, you can ask Mr. Marshburn. .\n     . . And that I do find it to be freely and voluntarily\n     entered, and knowingly as well.\n\n     Next, the trial court asked whether Noetzel was \u201cwithdrawing\n\n[his] speedy trial demand and wanting to enter a plea,\u201d and Noetzel\n\nconfirmed that was correct. The trial court then renewed the offer\n\nof counsel, which Noetzel rejected. Before accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea,\n\nthe trial court explained the consequences of pleading guilty to all\n\nfour of the charges, including that the penalty Noetzel would receive\n\nfor the first-degree murder of Eastwood would be either life in\n\nprison without parole or death. The trial court further apprised\n\nNoetzel that, by pleading guilty, he would be waiving his\n\n\n                                 - 12 -\n\fconstitutional rights to remain silent, to a jury trial, and to confront\n\nwitnesses, all of which Noetzel indicated he understood but wanted\n\nto waive and plead guilty. Noetzel confirmed that no one had\n\npromised him anything or threatened him in exchange for his plea;\n\nsaid that he was pleading guilty \u201c[b]ecause I am guilty\u201d; and further\n\nsaid that he did not require additional time to consider his strategy\n\nbecause he had already had \u201c210 days to ponder\u201d \u201cthe charges\n\nagainst [him] and any defenses that [he] might have.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel also confirmed that he had no objection to the factual\n\nbasis offered by the State for the four offenses to which he sought to\n\nplead guilty; with respect to the first-degree murder of Eastwood,\n\nthe factual basis was, \u201c[T]he defendant was an inmate at Mayo\n\nCorrectional Institute and did kill a fellow inmate by the name of\n\nDonald Eastwood by premeditated murder . . . in Lafayette County,\n\nFlorida.\u201d\n\n     Before accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea, the trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether there were any further suggested lines of inquiry. Noetzel\u2019s\n\nnow-standby counsel responded, \u201cAgain, Your Honor, I would say\n\nthis should all be done with the caveat that he hasn\u2019t been\n\nevaluated by an expert.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cThat\u2019s what I plan\n\n\n                                 - 13 -\n\fto do,\u201d accepted Noetzel\u2019s guilty plea, and also found Noetzel\n\ncompetent, ruling as follows:\n\n     Mr. Noetzel, I\u2019m going to accept your plea. I find it to be\n     freely and voluntarily made. There are facts to support\n     it. And it\u2019s all done with the cautionary issues that I\u2019ve\n     raised here with you regarding representing yourself and\n     waiving your right to have an attorney present and\n     represent you throughout the proceeding, and it\u2019s done\n     knowingly, intelligently. I do find you to be at this point\n     in time to be competent and intelligent and alert and the\n     plea is accepted.\n\n     After accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea and finding him competent, the\n\ntrial court explained that it was going \u201cto have [Noetzel] evaluated to\n\nmake sure that [he is] competent to proceed\u201d and reiterated that\n\nthis was being done \u201cout of [an] abundance of caution.\u201d\n\n   The Trial Court Orders a Competency Evaluation and the\n         Expert Finds Noetzel Competent to Proceed\n\n     In accordance with its ruling at the January 21 motion\n\nhearing, the day after the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s request for\n\nself-representation, accepted his guilty plea, and found him\n\ncompetent, it appointed Dr. Umesh M. Mhatre \u201cto assess and\n\nevaluate [Noetzel] concerning his competency to stand trial and/or\n\nnegotiate a disposition of his case.\u201d Consistent with the trial court\u2019s\n\noral pronouncement that the evaluation was being ordered \u201cout of\n\n\n\n                                - 14 -\n\fthe abundance of caution because of the severity of the possible\n\nsentences here,\u201d not because of bona fide reason to doubt Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncompetency, the appointment order states that the evaluation was\n\nbeing ordered based on \u201cconcerns raised by the Court, the State,\n\nand the Defense concerning the gravity of [Noetzel\u2019s] decisions\u201d to\n\ndischarge counsel and waive his right to a jury trial.\n\n     Dr. Mhatre reviewed the arrest reports and Noetzel\u2019s records\n\nfrom the Department of Corrections (DOC), examined Noetzel on\n\nFebruary 1, 2020, and found him competent to proceed. In\n\naddressing Noetzel\u2019s \u201cCompetency to Proceed,\u201d Dr. Mhatre\u2019s written\n\nreport includes this finding: \u201cThe patient understands the nature of\n\ncharges against him and has already pled guilty. He has released\n\nhis attorney because he wants to represent himself in the\n\nsentencing phase.\u201d The \u201cMedical and Psychiatric History\u201d portions\n\nof the report indicate that Noetzel \u201cdid not know what medications\n\nhe is currently receiving,\u201d that Noetzel \u201cdenies having any inpatient\n\npsychiatric care,\u201d but \u201chas received outpatient treatment in the\n\nDepartment of Corrections,\u201d and that Noetzel \u201cacknowledges having\n\nlow moods, insomnia, and anhedonia\u201d and \u201cstates that his prison\n\nlifestyle is what\u2019s making him depressed.\u201d The report notes that Dr.\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\fMhatre\u2019s review of Noetzel\u2019s DOC records revealed that Noetzel \u201chas\n\na past diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder and was on Trileptal\n\n300 mg twice a day and Effexor 150 mg a day.\u201d\n\n     Additionally, the \u201cMental Status Examination\u201d portion of Dr.\n\nMhatre\u2019s report includes these findings:\n\n           During the interview, [Noetzel] was polite,\n     respectful, and provided a lot of spontaneous\n     information. He was quick to acknowledge his problems\n     with his bad temper and impulsive behavior. He admits\n     having a past history of depression because of his prison\n     lifestyle, but the medications definitely seem[] to have\n     helped.\n           There was no evidence to auditory, visual, tactile,\n     olfactory, or kinesthetic hallucinations. He is oriented to\n     time, place, person. His memory is intact for immediate,\n     recent, remote events. There were no signs of pressured\n     speech, flight of ideas, or thought blocking.\n           The patient is currently not suicidal or homicidal.\n     His insight into his problem is adequate and his social\n     judgment is significantly impaired.\n\n     Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report lists the following as his \u201cImpression\u201d of\n\nNoetzel\u2019s mental health: (1) major depressive disorder; (2) history of\n\nsubstance abuse; and (3) antisocial personality disorder. With\n\nrespect to \u201cRecommendations,\u201d the report states that Noetzel\n\n\u201cacknowledges that the medications have helped him and he wants\n\nto stay on them as long as he needs to. He knows without the\n\nmedications his condition could deteriorate.\u201d\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fII. THE BENCH PENALTY-PHASE PROCEEDING\n\n The Trial Court Renews the Offer of Counsel and Renews the\n     Competency Finding in Light of the Expert\u2019s Report\n\n     The bench penalty-phase proceeding, which subsumed the\n\nSpencer4 hearing, occurred on February 21, 2020, and was a joint\n\npenalty phase with Noetzel\u2019s codefendant Bell, who had also\n\nexercised his right to self-representation, pleaded no contest, and,\n\nlike Noetzel, had waived his right to a penalty-phase jury. Before\n\ncommencing the penalty phase, the trial court renewed the offer of\n\ncounsel, which Noetzel rejected.\n\n     Before accepting argument or evidence, the trial court again\n\naddressed the issue of Noetzel\u2019s competency to proceed.\n\nSpecifically, the trial court stated that it had previously found\n\nNoetzel to be competent to proceed but \u201c[o]ut of the abundance of\n\ncaution,\u201d had ordered him \u201cexamined for competency\u201d and had\n\nsince received Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report. The trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether Noetzel took \u201cany exception to the Court considering [the]\n\nreport . . . and [Dr. Mhatre\u2019s] determination that [Noetzel is]\n\n\n\n\n     4. Spencer v. State, 615 So. 2d 688 (Fla. 1993).\n\n\n                                 - 17 -\n\fcompetent to represent [himself] or competent to proceed,\u201d and\n\nNoetzel responded that he \u201cwas happy with everything [Dr. Mhatre]\n\nsaid.\u201d\n\n     Based on the expert\u2019s evaluation, the trial court found that\n\nNoetzel was \u201ccompetent to proceed and there\u2019s no indication of any\n\nsort of mental infirmity or defect that would prevent [him] from doing\n\nso.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Noetzel indicated that he wanted to enter\n\nthe competency evaluation as mitigation, and the trial court\n\nexplained that Noetzel would have the ability to do that. After\n\nexplaining the penalty-phase proceedings that were to follow, the\n\ntrial court again renewed the offer of counsel, and Noetzel again\n\nindicated that he was certain he wanted to continue to represent\n\nhimself.\n\nThe Trial Court Conducts the Bench Penalty-Phase Proceeding\n\n     Thereafter, the State proceeded with its opening statement,\n\narguing that it intended to prove five aggravating circumstances in\n\nsupport of imposition of the death penalty: (1) prior violent felony\n\nbased on the contemporaneous attempted murder of Officer\n\nNewman; (2) under sentence of imprisonment for a felony; (3)\n\nEastwood\u2019s murder was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fexercise of any government function or the enforcement of laws\n\nbecause Eastwood\u2019s murder prevented him from completing his\n\nlawful sentence; (4) especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC);\n\nand (5) cold, calculated, and premeditated without any pretense of\n\nmoral or legal justification (CCP). Neither Noetzel nor Bell\n\npresented an opening statement.\n\n     The State presented the testimony of five witnesses, namely\n\ntwo corrections officers, both of whom Noetzel cross-examined; two\n\ninvestigators to whom Noetzel had confessed; and the medical\n\nexaminer who performed the victim\u2019s autopsy. The State also\n\nintroduced numerous exhibits including, without objection, certified\n\ncopies of Noetzel\u2019s judgments and sentences. During the State\u2019s\n\ncase, Noetzel joined Bell in objecting to lines of questions related to\n\nOfficer Newman, based on their joint argument, advanced by Bell,\n\nthat evidence of their attempt to murder Officer Newman should not\n\nsupport the application of the prior violent felony aggravator.\n\n     After the State rested, Bell and Noetzel called only themselves\n\nas witnesses. Noetzel took responsibility for his actions and\n\nintroduced his competency evaluation into evidence as mitigation.\n\nNoetzel also made the following statement in response to the trial\n\n\n                                 - 19 -\n\fcourt\u2019s question as to whether he had \u201canything [he] want[ed] the\n\nCourt to be aware of, any matters in mitigation?\u201d:\n\n            The only thing that\u2019s for mitigation that we\u2019ve\n     already gone through that I\u2019ve explained to you when you\n     were asking about my competency and I answered all\n     your questions.\n            Everything is stated quite plainly. There\u2019s nothing\n     more to say, you know.\n            I have no regrets for anything I\u2019ve done.\n            Talking about my childhood or my family or any of\n     those things, I don\u2019t think they have any bearing.\n            Everything -- if you have a question, I\u2019ll answer it.\n     I\u2019ve got no problem with it.\n            And I was quite, you know, happy to say I\u2019m guilty\n     for what I did.\n            Other than that, I don\u2019t understand the mitigating\n     part and other. You know, talking about regrets,\n     problems in childhood, you know, those things are in the\n     past, you know. People who use things, oh, I was beat\n     up as a child. That\u2019s not a mitigating circumstance as\n     far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s an excuse. You know, you did\n     what you did. You knew what you were doing, right or\n     wrong. We all know it.\n            The State, I\u2019m quite content with that and I think\n     you for letting me talk.\n            As I said, if y\u2019all or anybody else has any questions,\n     I\u2019ll answer them.\n\n     Following closing arguments, the trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether there was anything further that should occur prior to the\n\nsentencing hearing, at which point the State asked the trial court to\n\norder a PSI for both Bell and Noetzel in light of the minimal\n\nmitigation presented. Over Bell\u2019s objection that a PSI was not\n\n\n                                - 20 -\n\frequired because both he and Noetzel had presented some\n\nmitigation, the trial court exercised its discretion to \u201corder one\n\nanyway.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel cooperated with the PSI, which contains a \u201cPhysical\n\nand Mental Health\u201d section that denotes Noetzel\u2019s \u201chealth status\u201d as\n\n\u201cgood\u201d and includes the following remark: \u201cThe subject stated that\n\nhe is in good physical health and does not have mental health\n\nissues. He does state that he was diagnosed with paranoid\n\nschizophrenia.\u201d\n\nIII. THE FINAL PENALTY-PHASE HEARING\n\n     Before commencing the final penalty-phase hearing on March\n\n13, 2020, the trial court renewed the offer of counsel, which Noetzel\n\nrejected. In renewing the offer of counsel, the trial court (1)\n\nreminded Noetzel of the \u201clong litany of questions\u201d it had gone\n\nthrough with him \u201cregarding [his] decision to represent [himself],\u201d\n\n(2) asked Noetzel whether he recalled those questions and his\n\nanswers and whether he had any questions, and (3) inquired as to\n\nwhether anyone had \u201cthreatened or forced\u201d Noetzel to get him to\n\nreject counsel. Noetzel indicated that he understood his right to\n\ncounsel and confirmed that he still wished to proceed without\n\n\n                                 - 21 -\n\fcounsel and that no one had threatened him in regard to his\n\ndecision.\n\n     Next, the trial court asked Noetzel whether he had received a\n\ncopy of the PSI and, if so, whether he had any \u201cadditions or\n\ncorrections or points of clarification\u201d to it. Noetzel confirmed that\n\nhe had received a copy, agreed that the information in it was\n\naccurate, and stated that he did not have anything to add.\n\n     After hearing argument from the State regarding the four\n\ncounts on which Noetzel was to be sentenced, the trial court\n\ninquired of Noetzel as to whether he had \u201cany further matters in\n\nmitigation other than those that [he] presented in the penalty\n\nphase.\u201d Noetzel stated that he did not have additional mitigation to\n\npresent and that he did not wish to address the court \u201cas far as\n\nmitigation and recommendation . . . of the sentence.\u201d 5\n\n     The trial court then proceeded to the sentencing portion of the\n\nhearing during which it adjudicated Noetzel guilty of each crime to\n\nwhich he had pleaded guilty and sentenced Noetzel to death for\n\n\n\n\n     5. This portion of the final hearing constituted additional\nproceedings in furtherance of the requirements of Spencer, 615 So.\n2d at 690-91.\n\n                                 - 22 -\n\fEastwood\u2019s first-degree murder, to life for the attempted first-degree\n\nmurder of Officer Newman with a weapon, to thirty years for\n\nconspiracy to commit first-degree murder of Officer Newman, and to\n\nfifteen years for possession of a weapon in prison, with all\n\nsentences to run concurrent with one another.\n\n                       The Sentencing Order\n\n     The trial court\u2019s sentencing order reflects its rulings that\n\nNoetzel \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel,\u201d\n\nand that Noetzel\u2019s \u201cguilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and\n\nvoluntary.\u201d The order also reflects that the trial court rejected one\n\nof the five statutory aggravating circumstances argued by the State,\n\nnamely that the capital felony was committed to disrupt or hinder\n\nthe lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement\n\nof laws. However, the trial court found that the State had proven\n\nthe existence of the other four aggravators it had argued beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and assigned each the noted weight: (1) the\n\ncapital felony was committed by a person previously convicted of a\n\nfelony and under sentence of imprisonment (great weight); (2) the\n\ndefendant was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a\n\nfelony involving the use or threat of violence to the person (great\n\n\n                                - 23 -\n\fweight); (3) the capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or\n\ncruel (HAC) (very great weight); and (4) the capital felony was a\n\nhomicide and was committed in a cold, calculated, and\n\npremeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal\n\njustification (CCP) (very great weight).\n\n     The trial court considered statutory mitigating circumstances\n\nbut found that none had been established. However, it found the\n\nfollowing three nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and assigned\n\neach the noted weight: (1) the defendant cooperated during the\n\ninvestigation of and prosecution for the killing of Mr. Eastwood\n\n(little weight); (2) the defendant exhibited appropriate courtroom\n\nbehavior (little weight); and (3) the defendant was previously\n\ndiagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (little weight).\n\n     The trial court addressed Noetzel\u2019s previous diagnosis as\n\nfollows:\n\n          According to statements made by the Defendant\n     during the preparation of the PSI, he had been diagnosed\n     with paranoid schizophrenia. The Defendant did not\n     mention any mental health issues during the penalty\n     phase or present evidence to support it. Additionally, he\n     reported being in \u201cgood physical health\u201d and was found\n     competent not only to proceed but also to waive counsel\n     and represent himself.\n\n\n\n                                 - 24 -\n\f           Court\u2019s Finding. Therefore, given the Defendant\u2019s\n     complete candor with this Court concerning his\n     involvement in the crimes, this Court finds no reason to\n     question or doubt this diagnosis. However, without\n     more, a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia cannot\n     justify or excuse the Defendant\u2019s conduct. Nonetheless,\n     this Court assigns this mitigating circumstance little\n     weight.\n\n     In sentencing Noetzel to death, the trial court further found\n\n\u201cthat the aggravating factors clearly, convincingly, and beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel now appeals.\n\n                              ANALYSIS\n\n     In this direct appeal, we address three issues. Noetzel briefed\n\ntwo issues in which he challenges\u2014on several grounds related to\n\nhis competency and the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s Faretta\n\ninquiry\u2014the trial court\u2019s rulings allowing him to waive counsel and\n\nrepresent himself. Noetzel\u2019s first issue centers on the trial court\u2019s\n\nhandling of his statement during the Faretta inquiry that he had\n\nbeen prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for depression and chronic back\n\npain that he was not taking \u201cat this moment.\u201d Noetzel\u2019s second\n\nissue concerns the trial court\u2019s acceptance, as nonstatutory\n\nmitigation, of his self-disclosure, made during the PSI, that he had\n\n\n\n                                 - 25 -\n\fbeen diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at an unspecified point\n\nin his past, before an expert found him competent to proceed and\n\nbefore the trial court found him competent. As the third issue, we\n\nconduct a mandatory review of Noetzel\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n      (1) Competency and the Right to Self-Representation\n\n     Noetzel first argues that the trial court erred in granting his\n\nrequest for self-representation because it failed to adequately\n\ninquire into his mental-health status, including by ordering a\n\ncompetency evaluation, before allowing him to represent himself.\n\nHe further claims that the trial court failed to \u201cmake[] a\n\ndetermination of record\u201d that he \u201cdoes not suffer from severe mental\n\nillness to the point where [he] is not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself\u201d within the meaning of Florida Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 3.111(d)(3).6\n\n\n\n\n     6. Noetzel also argues that the trial court failed to find that\nhis counsel waiver was \u201cintelligent.\u201d However, as the State correctly\nargues, the trial court made this finding in its sentencing order,\nruling as follows: \u201c[A] very lengthy and thorough Faretta inquiry was\nconducted pursuant to the Defendant\u2019s right and decision to\nrepresent himself. After it was determined that the Defendant\nknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, he was\npermitted to represent himself.\u201d\n\n                                - 26 -\n\f      We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a request for self-\n\nrepresentation for abuse of discretion, Knight v. State, 211 So. 3d 1,\n\n15 (Fla. 2016), and where, as here, the errors alleged on appeal\n\nwere not preserved, reversal is warranted only if the defendant\n\nestablishes fundamental error, see Hopkins v. State, 632 So. 2d\n\n1372, 1374 (Fla. 1994); see also \u00a7 924.051(3), Fla. Stat. (2020) (\u201cA\n\njudgment or sentence may be reversed on appeal only when an\n\nappellate court determines after a review of the complete record that\n\nprejudicial error occurred and was properly preserved in the trial\n\ncourt or, if not properly preserved, would constitute fundamental\n\nerror.\u201d).\n\n      Noetzel\u2019s arguments implicate three different standards. The\n\nfirst is the standard for competence to stand trial\u2014i.e., whether the\n\ndefendant has \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and has \u201ca\n\nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against\n\nhim.\u201d Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960) (quoting\n\nSolicitor General\u2019s suggestion). The Dusky standard is the same\n\nstandard of competence required to plead guilty or to waive the\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 27 -\n\fright to assistance of counsel. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389,\n\n391, 398, 402 (1993).\n\n     The second is the Faretta standard for measuring whether a\n\ncompetent defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel is knowing,\n\nvoluntary, and intelligent. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835.\n\n     The third is the competency standard to conduct trial\n\nproceedings without assistance of counsel, which is \u201csomewhat\n\nhigher\u201d than the Dusky competency standard. Woodbury v. State,\n\n320 So. 3d 631, 646 (Fla. 2021) (citing Wall v. State, 238 So. 3d\n\n127, 140 (Fla. 2018)). Specifically, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt has held that states may \u201cinsist upon representation by\n\ncounsel for those competent enough to stand trial under Dusky but\n\nwho still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they\n\nare not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\u201d\n\nIndiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164, 178 (2008); see also Fla. R.\n\nCrim. P. 3.111(d)(3) (implementing Edwards); Wall, 238 So. 3d at\n\n140-41 (\u201cUnder Edwards . . . there is a heightened competency\n\nstandard for actually representing oneself at trial; thus defendants\n\nmay be competent to waive counsel yet incompetent to represent\n\nthemselves.\u201d).\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\f     As explained below, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nunder any of these standards because (A) a competency hearing\n\nwas not required; (B) competent, substantial evidence supports the\n\ntrial court\u2019s findings that Noetzel\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel\n\nwas knowing, voluntary, and intelligent under Faretta; and (C) the\n\ntrial court was not required to find that Noetzel suffered from severe\n\nmental illness to the point that he was incompetent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself.\n\n     A. Competency\n\n     Noetzel first argues that his disclosure during the Faretta\n\ninquiry that he had been prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for depression\n\nand chronic back pain that he was not taking \u201cat this moment\u201d\n\nshould have resulted in further inquiry from the trial court.\n\nSpecifically, he contends that the trial court should have ordered a\n\ncompetency evaluation and withheld its ruling on his request for\n\nself-representation pending the results. However, because a\n\ncompetency hearing was not required under the facts of Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncase, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n     A criminal defendant has the right to not be proceeded against\n\nwhile mentally incompetent to stand trial, Pate v. Robinson, 383\n\n\n                                 - 29 -\n\fU.S. 375, 378 (1966), and the requirement to inquire as to the\n\ndefendant\u2019s competency is triggered as follows:\n\n     If, at any material stage of a criminal proceeding, the\n     court of its own motion, or on motion of counsel for the\n     defendant or for the state, has reasonable ground to\n     believe that the defendant is not mentally competent to\n     proceed, the court shall immediately enter its order\n     setting a time for a hearing to determine the defendant\u2019s\n     mental condition . . . .\n\nFla. R. Crim. P. 3.210(b).\n\n     In Godinez, the Supreme Court explained that a trial court is\n\n\u201cnot . . . required to make a competency determination in every case\n\nin which a defendant seeks to plead guilty or to waive his right to\n\ncounsel. As in any criminal case, a competency determination is\n\nnecessary only when a court has reason to doubt the defendant\u2019s\n\ncompetence.\u201d 509 U.S. at 401 n.13 (citing Drope v. Missouri, 420\n\nU.S. 162, 180-81 (1975); Pate, 383 U.S. at 385).\n\n     Moreover, in cases involving criminal defendants with histories\n\nof mental illness, this Court has recognized that \u201c[n]ot every\n\nmanifestation of mental illness demonstrates incompetence to stand\n\ntrial; rather, the evidence must indicate a present inability to assist\n\ncounsel or understand the charges.\u201d Barnes v. State, 124 So. 3d\n\n904, 913 (Fla. 2013) (quoting Card v. Singletary, 981 F.2d 481, 487-\n\n\n                                 - 30 -\n\f88 (11th Cir. 1992)); see also Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at 644\n\n(rejecting Woodbury\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in failing to\n\norder a competency hearing where, \u201c[l]ike the defendant in Barnes,\n\nWoodbury disclosed a history and diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but\n\nnothing about his behavior in court indicated a present inability to\n\nunderstand the proceedings against him or an inability to consult\n\nwith his standby counsel (or with counsel, had an attorney been\n\nappointed)\u201d); Nelson v. State, 43 So. 3d 20, 29 (Fla. 2010) (holding,\n\nin the context of rejecting a claim that trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to move for a competency determination, that a \u201csuicide\n\nattempt alone\u201d does not raise a \u201cpresumption\u201d of incompetency and\n\nthat \u201cthe administration of Mellaril, a powerful antipsychotic drug,\n\ndid not necessarily render [the defendant] incompetent\u201d).\n\n     Here, when the trial court questioned Noetzel regarding his\n\nmental health history during the Faretta inquiry, Noetzel disclosed\n\nthat he had been prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for \u201cdepression\u201d and\n\n\u201cchronic back pain\u201d and stated that he was not taking his\n\nprescribed medication \u201cat this moment.\u201d The trial court inquired\n\nfurther, and Noetzel clarified that his medication does not positively\n\nor negatively affect his ability to understand, but rather, \u201cjust kind\n\n\n                                 - 31 -\n\fof keeps [him] calm.\u201d Noetzel also confirmed that he was \u201cfully\n\ncapable\u201d of understanding and comprehending \u201ceverything\u201d that the\n\ntrial court was discussing with him.\n\n     The trial court had the advantage of observing Noetzel in\n\nperson and clearly did not witness anything that caused it to\n\nquestion Noetzel\u2019s competency. Further, a review of the record\n\nindicates nothing about Noetzel\u2019s behavior\u2014at any point before or\n\nafter the trial court granted his request for self-representation\u2014that\n\nwould arguably demonstrate a present inability to understand the\n\nproceedings against him or an inability to consult with standby\n\ncounsel as required to trigger a competency hearing. See Fla. R.\n\nCrim. P. 3.210(b); see also Barnes, 124 So. 3d at 913.\n\n     Noetzel\u2019s case sits in stark comparison to a case such as\n\nDrope, 420 U.S. at 179, where the trial court ignored instances that\n\nraised a bona fide doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency,\n\nincluding that the defendant had attempted suicide during the trial\n\nand had engaged in \u201cpronounced irrational behavior\u201d between the\n\ntime of the crime and the trial. There was no such behavior in\n\nNoetzel\u2019s case. To the contrary, Noetzel filed several pro se motions,\n\nwhich he followed up with a pro se letter. During all four of the\n\n\n                                - 32 -\n\fcourt proceedings\u2014(1) the first appearance and arraignment, (2) the\n\nmotion hearing, (3) the bench penalty-phase proceeding, and (4) the\n\nfinal penalty-phase hearing\u2014Noetzel demonstrated that he\n\nunderstood the legal issues; he articulated his strategy; he engaged\n\nwith the trial court\u2019s questioning; and his courtroom behavior was\n\nappropriate.\n\n     Moreover, the trial court ultimately did order a competency\n\nevaluation even though one was not necessary under the Pate\n\nstandard codified in rule 3.210(b). Specifically, after inquiring of\n\nthen-appointed defense counsel, who stated that he had \u201cnot seen\n\nany reason personally to doubt that Mr. Noetzel is competent to\n\nmake the decision to represent himself,\u201d the trial court stated that it\n\ndid not \u201csee any reason to believe in any way that [Noetzel was]\n\nincompetent to proceed.\u201d Nevertheless, despite finding Noetzel\n\ncompetent, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation \u201cout of\n\nthe abundance of caution because of the severity of the possible\n\nsentences here.\u201d Thereafter, the expert found Noetzel competent to\n\nproceed, and the trial court subsequently renewed its competency\n\nfinding based on the expert\u2019s report.\n\n     Under these facts, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\n                                 - 33 -\n\f     B. Self-Representation\n\n     A competent criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right\n\nto represent himself at trial. Tennis v. State, 997 So. 2d 375, 377-\n\n78 (Fla. 2008). A defendant\u2019s unequivocal request for self-\n\nrepresentation triggers the trial court\u2019s obligation to hold a Faretta\n\ninquiry, the purpose of which is to determine whether the waiver of\n\nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is knowing, voluntary, and\n\nintelligent. Tennis, 997 So. 2d at 378. Unlike the competency\n\ninquiry discussed above, which focuses on \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mental\n\ncapacity,\u201d i.e., \u201cwhether he has the ability to understand the\n\nproceedings,\u201d the \u201cpurpose of the \u2018knowing and voluntary\u2019 inquiry\u201d\n\nunder Faretta \u201cis to determine whether the defendant actually does\n\nunderstand the significance and consequences of a particular\n\ndecision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S.\n\nat 401 n.12.\n\n     Regarding the \u201cproper scope\u201d of the Faretta inquiry, this Court\n\nrecently reiterated \u201cthat once a court determines that a competent\n\ndefendant of his or own free will has \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019\n\nwaived the right to counsel, the dictates of Faretta are satisfied, the\n\ninquiry is over, and the defendant may proceed unrepresented.\u201d\n\n\n                                 - 34 -\n\fHooks v. State, 286 So. 3d 163, 168 (Fla. 2019) (quoting State v.\n\nBowen, 698 So. 2d 248, 251 (Fla. 1997)). In other words, \u201cthere are\n\nno \u2018magic words\u2019 under Faretta.\u201d Id. (quoting Potts v. State, 718 So.\n\n2d 757, 760 (Fla. 1998)). Rather, \u201c[t]he accused must only \u2018be made\n\naware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so\n\nthat the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and\n\nhis choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 167 (quoting Faretta,\n\n422 U.S. at 835). On review, the appellate court \u201cwill evaluate \u2018the\n\ndefendant\u2019s general understanding of his or her rights.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 168\n\n(quoting Potts, 718 So. 2d at 760).\n\n     In Noetzel\u2019s case, the trial court conducted a lengthy Faretta\n\ninquiry, during which it explained the dangers and disadvantages of\n\nself-representation and the advantages of being represented by\n\ncounsel. Noetzel now faults the trial court for not inquiring further\n\ninto his mental health status, but the record shows that during the\n\nFaretta inquiry, the trial court continued to question Noetzel until it\n\nwas satisfied that neither mental illness nor Noetzel\u2019s not taking his\n\nprescribed medication \u201cat this moment\u201d prevented Noetzel from\n\nunderstanding the rights being discussed.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 35 -\n\f     Further, there is no indication in the record that Noetzel failed\n\nto understand his rights or that he was not exercising his right to\n\nself-representation with his eyes open. To the contrary, Noetzel\n\nadmitted that he understood it was completely inadvisable to\n\nrepresent himself but explained that he wanted to do so to further\n\nhis strategy to quickly plead guilty because he was guilty and to\n\n\u201cstreamline\u201d the sentencing phase of the proceeding as much as\n\npossible. 7 Noetzel\u2019s disclosure of a mental illness does not preclude\n\nhim from waiving the right to counsel and proceeding pro se. Cf.\n\nWoodbury, 320 So. 3d at 647-48 (\u201cGiven that certain people with\n\nbipolar disorder function well and act rationally, we see no logic in\n\n\n\n\n      7. When the trial court questioned Noetzel as to why he\nwanted to waive a penalty-phase jury, Noetzel explained his\nstrategy, in part, as follows:\n\n           Why mess somebody else\u2019s life up? I\u2019ve already said\n     I\u2019m guilty. Every investigator that I\u2019ve sat in front of, I\u2019ve\n     walked them through step by step how I killed [Eastwood]\n     and the reasons that I wanted to kill that officer. Plain\n     and simple, walked them step by step. I have not\n     wavered from what I\u2019ve done.\n           There\u2019s no sense in bringing a jury involved and\n     messing up their lives, having to spend money to pay\n     people to come in her and uproot their lives when I can\n     just sit here with you and we can streamline this and be\n     done with it.\n\n                                 - 36 -\n\fcreating a per se rule or presumption that all individuals with\n\nbipolar disorder suffer so severely from mental illness that they are\n\nunable to carry out basic trial tasks without assistance.\u201d).\n\n     Because competent, substantial evidence supports the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s finding that Noetzel\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was\n\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent under Faretta, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in granting Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation.\n\n     C. Rule 3.111(d)(3)\n\n     Noetzel also argues that the trial court erred under the\n\n\u201csomewhat higher\u201d competency standard of rule 3.111(d)(3).\n\nWoodbury, 320 So. 3d at 646. We disagree.\n\n     Although the technical skill of a criminal defendant to\n\nrepresent himself is not part of the Faretta inquiry, \u201cthe\n\ngovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the\n\ntrial at times outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in acting as his\n\nown lawyer.\u201d Edwards, 554 U.S. at 177 (quoting Martinez v. Court\n\nof Appeal, 528 U.S. 152, 162 (2000)). Thus, the Supreme Court\n\nheld in Edwards that \u201cthe Constitution permits States to insist\n\nupon representation by counsel for those competent enough to\n\n\n                                 - 37 -\n\fstand trial under Dusky but who still suffer from severe mental\n\nillness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by themselves.\u201d Edwards, 554 U.S. at 178.\n\n     Following Edwards, this Court amended Florida Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 3.111(d)(3) to \u201cimplement the narrow limitation\n\nupon the right to self-representation recognized in Edwards,\u201d but\n\ndid so \u201c[w]ithout deciding whether Edwards compels states to\n\nprovide additional protection to severely mentally ill defendants.\u201d In\n\nre Amends. to Fla. Rule of Crim. Proc. 3.111, 17 So. 3d 272, 274 (Fla.\n\n2009). Rule 3.111(d)(3) thus authorizes trial courts to force counsel\n\nupon a competent criminal defendant who has waived the right to\n\ncounsel and seeks to represent himself at trial in the limited\n\ninstance where the defendant \u201csuffer[s] from severe mental illness\n\nto the point where [he] is not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself.\u201d\n\n     As an initial matter, the parties disagree as to whether rule\n\n3.111(d)(3) applies to a case like Noetzel\u2019s\u2014where the defendant\n\npleads guilty rather than proceed to trial but represents himself,\n\nwith standby counsel, during the penalty phase. However, we need\n\nnot resolve the open question of whether what happened in\n\n\n                                - 38 -\n\fNoetzel\u2019s case amounts to a defendant \u201cconduct[ing] trial\n\nproceedings by himself,\u201d within the meaning of rule 3.111(d). That\n\nis because, even if the rule applies to Noetzel\u2019s case, our precedent\n\nclearly establishes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby not forcing counsel upon Noetzel under the rule.\n\n     In Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at 647-48, after reviewing the record,\n\nwe rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his \u201cpurportedly erratic,\u201d\n\nid. at 648, \u201cbehavior in court, together with his bipolar diagnosis,\n\nrequired the trial court to find that [he] suffered from severe mental\n\nillness to the point of being incompetent to conduct the proceedings\n\nby himself,\u201d id. at 647. Under Woodbury, Noetzel\u2019s case is not even\n\nclose, as there is no \u201cpurportedly erratic\u201d behavior. Indeed, there is\n\nnothing in the record to indicate that Noetzel\u2019s mental illness\n\nmanifested in a way that would have precluded him from\n\nconducting trial proceedings by himself within the meaning of rule\n\n3.111(d)(3). To the contrary, the record shows that Noetzel filed\n\nvarious pro se motions, including a motion to compel a ruling on\n\nhis request for self-representation, and addressed them with the\n\ntrial court. During the bench penalty-phase proceeding, Noetzel\n\ncross-examined witnesses, objected to one of the State\u2019s exhibits,\n\n\n                                 - 39 -\n\fintroduced his competency evaluation into evidence, and made a\n\nstatement to the court that aligned with his previously explained\n\nstrategies of pleading guilty because he was guilty and of\n\nstreamlining the penalty-phase proceedings as much as possible.\n\nDuring all of the proceedings, Noetzel\u2019s interactions with the trial\n\ncourt were appropriate; he had no trouble following what was\n\nhappening or carrying out his previously articulated strategies.\n\nMoreover, before proceeding with the bench penalty phase, the trial\n\ncourt did, in fact, rule that Noetzel was \u201ccompetent to proceed and\n\nthere\u2019s no indication of any sort of mental infirmity or defect that\n\nwould prevent [him] from doing so.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports that finding. 8\n\n\n\n\n     8. Noetzel faults the trial court for limiting the competency\nevaluation that it ordered in an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d to his\ncompetency to proceed\u2014as opposed to also ordering evaluation of\nwhether he suffers from severe mental illness to the point he is not\ncompetent to conduct trial proceedings by himself within the\nmeaning of rule 3.111(d)(3). However, the Florida Statutes and this\nCourt\u2019s procedural rules governing the appointment of experts to\nevaluate competency address mental competence to proceed and\nrequire experts to detail specific findings regarding the defendant\u2019s\nmental capacity\u2014findings that were made by the expert in this\ncase. See \u00a7 916.12, Fla. Stat. (2020); Fla R. Crim. P. 3.211-3.212.\nThese provisions do not require additional findings from appointed\nexperts regarding the \u201csomewhat higher\u201d \u201ccompetency standard to\n\n                                 - 40 -\n\f     Accordingly, even assuming that rule 3.111(d)(3) applies, the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to find that Noetzel\n\nsuffered from severe mental illness to the point of being\n\nincompetent to conduct the penalty-phase proceedings by himself.\n\n              (2) Noetzel\u2019s Disclosure During the PSI\n\n     In his second issue, Noetzel argues that even if the trial court\n\ndid not initially err by granting his request for self-representation, it\n\nerred by continuing to allow him to represent himself at the final\n\npenalty-phase hearing that occurred on March 13, 2020, following\n\nthe PSI. More specifically, Noetzel claims that because the trial\n\ncourt accepted, as nonstatutory mitigation, his self-disclosure\n\nduring the PSI that he had been diagnosed with paranoid\n\nschizophrenia at an unspecified point in his past, the trial court\n\nwas required to conduct a new Faretta inquiry and revisit the issue\n\nof competency before accepting Noetzel\u2019s rejection of the renewed\n\noffer of counsel. These arguments were not preserved below, and\n\nwe hold that Noetzel has failed to establish an abuse of discretion\n\nby the trial court, let alone fundamental error.\n\n\n\nconduct trial proceedings without assistance.\u201d Woodbury, 320 So.\n3d at 646.\n\n                                 - 41 -\n\f     First, with respect to competency, the self-disclosure pertained\n\nto a diagnosis that occurred at some unspecified point in Noetzel\u2019s\n\npast, but before the trial court\u2019s interactions with Noetzel, before the\n\nexpert evaluated Noetzel and found him competent to proceed, and\n\nbefore the trial court\u2019s competency findings. The trial court\u2019s\n\nsubsequent acceptance of mitigation in the form of a past diagnosis\n\ndoes not change the competency calculus because mitigation\n\npertains to \u201cfactors in the defendant\u2019s background that would\n\nmitigate against imposition of the death penalty,\u201d \u00a7 921.141(7)(h),\n\nFla. Stat. (2020) (emphasis added), whereas competency pertains to\n\npresent ability, see Dusky, 362 U.S. at 402. And, again, as\n\naddressed under issue 1, there are no manifestations of mental\n\nillness or other behavior anywhere in the record that give rise to a\n\nbona fide doubt as to Noetzel\u2019s competence\u2014either to stand trial or,\n\nassuming rule 3.111(d)(3) applies, to conduct trial proceedings by\n\nhimself. See Dessaure v. State, 55 So. 3d 478, 482-83 (Fla. 2010)\n\n(\u201cOnce a defendant has been deemed competent, the presumption\n\nof competence continues throughout all subsequent proceedings. A\n\nsubsequent competency hearing is only required \u2018if a bona fide\n\nquestion as to the defendant\u2019s competency has been raised.\u2019 \u201d)\n\n\n                                 - 42 -\n\f(citation omitted) (quoting Boyd v. State, 910 So. 2d 167, 187 (Fla.\n\n2005)).\n\n     Second, the trial court\u2019s crediting of Noetzel\u2019s self-disclosure as\n\nmitigation did not mandate a new Faretta inquiry before the trial\n\ncourt could properly accept Noetzel\u2019s rejection of the renewed offer\n\nof counsel at the beginning of the final penalty-phase hearing. Our\n\nprecedent requires that the trial court renew the offer of counsel at\n\neach subsequent crucial stage of the proceeding. See Traylor v.\n\nState, 596 So. 2d 957, 968 (Fla. 1992) (explaining that, under the\n\nFlorida Constitution, \u201cthe defendant is entitled to decide at each\n\ncrucial stage of the proceedings whether he or she requires the\n\nassistance of counsel\u201d and that \u201cthe waiver [of counsel] applies only\n\nto the present stage and must be renewed at each subsequent\n\ncrucial stage where the defendant is unrepresented\u201d); see also Fla.\n\nR. Crim. P. 3.111(d)(5) (\u201cIf a waiver is accepted at any stage of the\n\nproceedings, the offer of assistance of counsel shall be renewed by\n\nthe court at each subsequent stage of the proceedings at which the\n\ndefendant appears without counsel.\u201d).\n\n     However, absent a substantial change in circumstances that\n\nwould cause the trial court to question its original ruling on the\n\n\n                                 - 43 -\n\fdefendant\u2019s request for self-representation, there is no concomitant\n\nrequirement to revisit Faretta every time the offer of counsel is\n\nsubsequently renewed and rejected. See Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at\n\n647 n.7 (\u201cWe do not suggest that all of these [renewed] offers [of\n\ncounsel] and Faretta inquiries were legally required. The record\n\nindicates that the trial court conducted so many inquiries to ensure\n\nthat the offer of counsel was renewed at all critical stages of the\n\nproceedings. Nothing in the record suggests that any of the\n\ninquiries were prompted by new concerns about [the defendant\u2019s]\n\nbehavior or competency.\u201d); see also United States v. Nunez, 137 F.\n\nApp\u2019x 214, 215 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201cIf we were to place upon the\n\ndistrict court an obligation to reassess its Faretta hearing decision,\n\nwe would do so only on a showing of a substantial change in\n\ncircumstances since the initial hearing.\u201d). 9\n\n     In this case, when Noetzel rejected the renewed offer of\n\ncounsel at the final penalty-phase hearing, there had been no\n\n\n\n      9. To the extent the First District Court of Appeal held to the\ncontrary in Howard v. State, 147 So. 3d 1040, 1043 (Fla. 1st DCA\n2014), when it stated (emphasis ours) that \u201c[f]ailure to renew the\noffer of counsel at a critical stage and conduct a Faretta inquiry if\nthe defendant rejects the renewed offer is per se reversible error,\u201d we\ndisapprove Howard.\n\n                                 - 44 -\n\fchange of circumstances that should have caused the trial court to\n\nquestion its finding from the January 21, 2020, motion hearing that\n\nNoetzel knowingly, intelligently, and voluntary exercised his right to\n\nself-representation under Faretta. Moreover, even though it would\n\nnot have been an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have\n\naccepted Noetzel\u2019s representation that he wanted to continue pro se,\n\nthe trial court actually did revisit Faretta, at least in part, before\n\npermitting Noetzel to do so by (1) reminding Noetzel of the \u201clong\n\nlitany of questions\u201d it had gone through with him \u201cregarding [his]\n\ndecision to represent [himself],\u201d (2) asking Noetzel whether he\n\nrecalled those questions and his answers and whether he had any\n\nquestions, and (3) inquiring as to whether anyone had \u201cthreatened\n\nor forced\u201d Noetzel to get him to reject counsel. Noetzel indicated\n\nthat he understood his right to counsel and confirmed that he still\n\nwished to proceed without counsel and that no one had threatened\n\nhim in regard to his decision.\n\n     In our view, the trial court did everything right. It certainly did\n\nnot fundamentally err.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 45 -\n\f                            (3) Guilty Plea\n\n     Because we have rejected Noetzel\u2019s argument that the trial\n\ncourt erred by finding him competent to waive counsel and because\n\nthe competency standards for waiving the right to counsel, pleading\n\nguilty, and standing trial are all the same Dusky standard, it follows\n\nthat Noetzel was competent to plead guilty immediately after his\n\ncounsel waiver. See Godinez, 509 U.S. at 391, 398, 402.\n\n     However, where the defendant\u2019s guilty plea results in a\n\nsentence of death, our mandatory obligation to review whether\n\nsufficient evidence supports the first-degree murder conviction, see\n\nFla. R. App. P. 9.142(a)(5), requires a review of the guilty plea,\n\nunder the following standard:\n\n     \u201c[W]hen a defendant has pled guilty to the charges\n     resulting in a penalty of death, this Court\u2019s review shifts\n     to the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary nature of that\n     plea.\u201d Winkles v. State, 894 So. 2d 842, 847 (Fla. 2005)\n     (quoting Lynch v. State, 841 So. 2d 362, 375 (Fla. 2003)).\n     Thus, . . . the Court must \u201cscrutinize the plea to ensure\n     that the defendant was made aware of the consequences\n     of his plea, was apprised of the constitutional rights he\n     was waiving, and pled guilty voluntarily.\u201d Id. (quoting\n     Ocha [v. State], 826 So. 2d [956,] 965 [(Fla. 2002)]).\n\nDoty v. State, 170 So. 3d 731, 738 (Fla. 2015). In addition, the Doty\n\nCourt looked to \u201c[t]he factual basis for the plea\u201d to determine that\n\n\n\n                                 - 46 -\n\fthere was \u201ccompetent, substantial evidence to support the\n\nconviction for first-degree murder.\u201d 170 So. 3d at 739.\n\n     Noetzel\u2019s plea satisfies the Doty standard. The trial court\n\nadvised Noetzel of the constitutional rights that he would be waiving\n\nby pleading guilty, and Noetzel indicated that he understood. See\n\nGodinez, 509 U.S. at 397 n.7 (\u201cA criminal defendant waives three\n\nconstitutional rights when he pleads guilty: the privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, the right to a jury trial, and the right to confront\n\none\u2019s accusers.\u201d) (citing Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243\n\n(1969)). The trial court also reviewed the two possible sentences\n\nthat could result from a guilty plea, namely life in prison without\n\nthe possibility of parole or death, and Noetzel confirmed that he\n\nunderstood. Additionally, the trial court inquired into the\n\nvoluntariness of Noetzel\u2019s plea, and Noetzel stated that no one had\n\npromised him anything or threatened him in exchange for the plea.\n\nTo the contrary, Noetzel said that he was pleading guilty \u201c[b]ecause\n\nI am guilty.\u201d Finally, the factual basis the State provided for the\n\nplea, to which Noetzel stated he had no objection, is competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence to support Noetzel\u2019s conviction for first-degree\n\nmurder. See Doty, 170 So. 3d at 739.\n\n\n                                 - 47 -\n\f                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Noetzel\u2019s first-degree\n\nmurder conviction and sentence of death.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\nCANADY, C.J., and POLSTON, LAWSON, MU\u00d1IZ, COURIEL, and\nGROSSHANS, JJ., concur.\nLABARGA, J., concurs in result with an opinion.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION\nAND, IF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nLABARGA, J., concurring in result.\n\n     For the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in\n\nLawrence v.

Noetzel appeals his judgment of conviction of first-\n\ndegree murder and sentence of death. We have jurisdiction, see\n\nart. V, \u00a7 3(b)(1), Fla. Const., and for the reasons below affirm\n\nNoetzel\u2019s conviction and sentence of death.\n\n                           BACKGROUND\n\n     While serving a life sentence at Mayo Correctional Institution,\n\nNoetzel joined with his cellmate, Jesse Bell, in developing a plan to\n\nmurder corrections officer James Newman, whom they disliked, and\n\na fellow inmate, whom they would select at a later date. They\n\freduced their plan to writing in the following twelve steps, which\n\nthey titled \u201cCountdown To Extention\u201d [sic]:\n\n     1. Get on vegan diet\n     2. Get multiple tools\n     3. Get diagram of area\n     4. Find a gofer\n     5. Baby powder?\n     6. Patience!!!!\n     7. Pick a dick sucker\n     8. Background check on dick sucker\n     9. Pick a date\n     10. Commence dry runs - rehearsals\n     11. Exicute [sic]!\n     12. Work on spelling!!\n\n     In accordance with their plan, Noetzel and Bell got on a vegan\n\ndiet, which allowed them greater access to the area of the kitchen\n\nwhere Officer Newman worked. They used other inmates to scout\n\nthe layout of the kitchen, drew a diagram of the area where Officer\n\nNewman worked, and obtained pieces of metal and fence, which\n\nthey sharpened into weapons. They also selected their fellow\n\ninmate Donald H. Eastwood, Jr., to kill because they believed him\n\nto be homosexual and a child molester.\n\n     On June 26, 2019, after Noetzel lured Eastwood to his and\n\nBell\u2019s cell, Noetzel stabbed Eastwood in the eyes using their\n\nhomemade weapons while Bell restrained and manually choked\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fEastwood. Noetzel hung up a sheet to prevent anyone from seeing\n\ninside the cell, and after confirming Eastwood was dead, Noetzel\n\nand Bell covered Eastwood\u2019s body with a blanket and hid the body\n\nunder a bunk in the cell. They also cleaned up Eastwood\u2019s blood\n\nwith a towel and hung up a note in their cell that read, \u201cGOD\n\nHATES FAGS[.] FAGS HATE GOD! KILL ALL FAGS AND CHO-\n\nMOES! (And Any C.O.\u2019s Who F*ck with You!).\u201d\n\n     Noetzel and Bell then went to the prison\u2019s dining area, where\n\nthey attempted to stab Officer Newman to death with another of\n\ntheir homemade weapons. Other officers intervened in the attack\n\non Officer Newman, who was seriously injured but survived;\n\napprehended Noetzel and Bell in the dining hall; and discovered\n\nEastwood\u2019s body in Noetzel and Bell\u2019s cell, after Bell told a\n\ncorrections officer that there was a dead \u201cchomo\u201d in his cell, with\n\n\u201cchomo\u201d being prison slang for \u201cchild molester.\u201d\n\n     Both Noetzel and Bell subsequently waived their Miranda 1\n\nrights and provided detailed confessions to law enforcement. As the\n\n\n\n\n     1. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftrial court\u2019s sentencing order accurately reflects, with respect to the\n\nfirst-degree murder of Eastwood, Noetzel\n\n     admitted that, after luring Mr. Eastwood to [the] cell\n     [Noetzel shared with Bell], [Noetzel] stabbed Mr.\n     Eastwood in the left eye, and his codefendant [Bell]\n     grabbed Mr. Eastwood from behind and began to \u201cchoke\n     him out.\u201d Mr. Eastwood did not immediately die, so\n     [Noetzel] attempted to stab him in the right eye while\n     [Bell] continued to \u201cchoke out\u201d Mr. Eastwood. At some\n     point during the attack, Mr. Eastwood began to question\n     the attack or beg for his life. Additionally, when [Bell]\n     initially released tension on Mr. Eastwood\u2019s neck, Mr.\n     Eastwood seemingly gasped for air. This caused [Bell] to\n     continue to strangle Mr. Eastwood even after he fell to\n     the ground. Eventually, Mr. Eastwood succumbed to\n     these injuries and died.\n\n     Consistent with Noetzel\u2019s description of the killing, the medical\n\nexaminer testified that Eastwood\u2019s cause of death was \u201csharp force\n\ntrauma to the left eye and brain[,] with neck compression,\u201d that the\n\nmanner of death was homicide, and that the puncture wound to\n\nEastwood\u2019s left eye\u2014which was \u201cbadly wounded\u201d and \u201cbasically just\n\na bloody pulp\u201d\u2014would have been \u201cparticularly painful.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel and Bell were jointly indicted on October 29, 2019, in\n\na five-count indictment for the first-degree premeditated murder of\n\nEastwood; the attempted first-degree murder of Officer Newman\n\nwith a weapon; and conspiracy to commit the first-degree murder of\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fOfficer Newman. In the fourth and fifth counts, Noetzel and Bell\n\nwere each indicted, respectively, on one count of possession of a\n\nweapon by an inmate.\n\n Noetzel Requests to Exercise His Right to Self-Representation\n                      and to Plead Guilty\n\n     At Noetzel\u2019s first appearance and arraignment, after appointed\n\ncounsel entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf, Noetzel personally\n\naddressed the trial court, stating that he would like a speedy trial,\n\nthat he \u201cwant[ed] to enter a plea of guilty right now,\u201d and that he\n\nwanted to represent himself and waive his right to counsel. The\n\npresiding judge informed Noetzel that he was filling in for the trial\n\njudge, and that it would be up to the assigned judge to conduct the\n\nFaretta 2 hearing required by Noetzel\u2019s unequivocal request for self-\n\nrepresentation. The presiding judge also told Noetzel, \u201c[I]f you want\n\nto put that in writing, that you want to represent yourself, by all\n\nmeans, do that,\u201d so that the assigned judge could \u201cconsider [it] at\n\nthe appropriate time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n     2. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f     Thereafter, Noetzel put his pro se requests in writing, filing a\n\ndemand for speedy trial, a motion to proceed pro se, and a motion\n\nto discharge appointed counsel. Noetzel then filed a pro se \u201cnotice\n\nof inquiry\u201d and a pro se motion to compel a hearing. In addition,\n\nNoetzel filed a pro se letter questioning why no hearing had been\n\nheld on his motion to proceed pro se; in the letter, Noetzel reiterated\n\nthat he had \u201cattempted to enter a plea of guilty on all charges\u201d at\n\nhis arraignment. Noetzel\u2019s pro se letter explained his strategy:\n\n          I fully understand the dictates of Faretta and am\n     knowingly and intelligently waiving my right to counsel.\n     Thereafter, I will be entering a plea of guilty to preserve\n     judicial resources and bring closure to all parties\n     concerned with the outcome of this case.\n\n     Following Noetzel\u2019s pro se filings, three proceedings relevant to\n\nthe issues raised in this appeal occurred: (1) a motion hearing, at\n\nwhich the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation, found Noetzel competent, and accepted Noetzel\u2019s\n\nguilty plea, (2) a bench penalty-phase proceeding that occurred\n\nafter an expert evaluated Noetzel and found him competent, and (3)\n\na final penalty-phase hearing that occurred after the presentence\n\ninvestigation (PSI).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fI. THE MOTION HEARING\n\n     The Trial Court Conducts a Faretta Inquiry and Grants\n           Noetzel\u2019s Request for Self-Representation\n\n     On January 21, 2020, the trial judge assigned to Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncase held a hearing on Noetzel\u2019s pro se motions. At the hearing,\n\nNoetzel personally addressed the court and listed his requests,\n\nnamely that he wished to discharge counsel, represent himself,\n\nenter a plea of guilty on all charges, demand a speedy trial, \u201cwaive\n\nall [of his] rights to a jury,\u201d and be sentenced by the trial court.\n\n     The trial court first addressed Noetzel\u2019s request to invoke his\n\nright to self-representation by conducting a Faretta inquiry. The\n\nlengthy inquiry included explanations by the trial court of the\n\nadvantages of counsel and the disadvantages of self-representation,\n\nall of which Noetzel indicated that he understood. Noetzel\u2019s\n\nresponses to the trial court\u2019s questions went beyond simple \u201cyeses\u201d\n\nand \u201cnoes.\u201d For example, in response to the trial court\u2019s question\n\nas to whether Noetzel had \u201cany questions about the dangers and\n\ndisadvantages of representing [himself]\u201d that the trial court had\n\nexplained, Noetzel responded, \u201cOh, what does it say, a lawyer that\n\nrepresents himself has a fool for a client.\u201d Noetzel then stated that\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhe was \u201cstill prepared to go forward with it,\u201d even though he\n\nunderstood it was \u201c[c]ompletely inadvisable\u201d to proceed on his own.\n\nIn response to follow-up questions by the trial court as to why he\n\nwanted to represent himself despite knowing it was inadvisable to\n\ndo so, Noetzel explained that he wanted to quickly plead guilty\n\nbecause, \u201cI am guilty. There\u2019s no, if and buts about it. I did what I\n\ndid. Got no problem with it.\u201d 3\n\n     During the Faretta inquiry, the trial court also questioned\n\nNoetzel as to whether he had \u201cever been diagnosed and/or treated\n\nfor any mental illness or disorder.\u201d Noetzel responded,\n\n\u201cDepression.\u201d The trial court followed up by asking Noetzel if he\n\nwas taking any medication, and when Noetzel said he was not \u201cat\n\nthis moment,\u201d the trial court questioned whether Noetzel had been\n\nprescribed medication. When Noetzel said yes, the trial court asked\n\n\n\n\n      3. Other examples of Noetzel\u2019s level of engagement with the\ntrial court during the Faretta inquiry include that Noetzel appeared\nto banter with the trial court in discussing the potential deportation\nconsequences of a guilty plea or conviction, stating \u201cI really like the\nUnited States of America, sir,\u201d and in discussing the possible\nconsequences of a conviction if a sex-offender statute applied to any\nof his prior convictions, stating, \u201cI like that law and I don\u2019t fall\nunder it.\u201d\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fNoetzel to explain why he was not taking his prescribed medication,\n\nand Noetzel said that he \u201cwanted to have a clear mind before I got to\n\nthis point.\u201d Then, the following exchange occurred between Noetzel\n\nand the trial court:\n\n            THE COURT: Okay. Does the medication cloud\n     your mind?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir, but I just wanted to\n     make sure I didn\u2019t have anything in my system because I\n     knew that this was going to be one of the questions that\n     would be asked.\n            THE COURT: All right. So does the medication help\n     you to understand or hinder your ability to understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT: It\u2019s a low grade -- I don\u2019t\n     remember the name of it, it\u2019s in my file, for depression,\n     but it\u2019s also for back pain because I have chronic back\n     pain, but because it\u2019s a psych med, it\u2019s registered that\n     way.\n            THE COURT: All right. . . . [T]hen I assume, if\n     there is an effect, it would cloud your ability to\n     understand, affect your ability negatively to understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n            THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n            THE COURT: Does it enhance your ability to\n     understand, the medication?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, it just kind of keeps me\n     calm.\n            THE COURT: Okay. But --\n            THE DEFENDANT: There\u2019s no positive or negative\n     to it except for what I take for my back.\n            THE COURT: But it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to\n     understand or comprehend anything about what\u2019s taking\n     place?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f           THE COURT: Do you feel that you\u2019re fully capable\n     currently as you sit here now without your medication to\n     understand and comprehend everything that you and I\n     are talking about?\n           THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n     The trial court then moved on to additional lines of inquiry,\n\nincluding whether, if Noetzel were permitted to represent himself,\n\nhe would accept standby counsel. After the trial court explained\n\nthe role of standby counsel, Noetzel said he understood and\n\nconfirmed his desire for standby counsel.\n\n     Before ruling on Noetzel\u2019s request for self-representation, the\n\ntrial court inquired of the State and Noetzel\u2019s then-appointed\n\ndefense counsel as to whether either suggested further lines of\n\ninquiry. Defense counsel suggested that the trial court should use\n\nthe procedure followed in another recent capital case, where the\n\ntrial court \u201cappointed a couple of doctors to evaluate [the defendant]\n\nto make sure that he was competent to make the decisions to\n\nrepresent himself.\u201d Counsel\u2019s suggestion prompted the following\n\nexchange:\n\n          THE COURT: Okay. And there\u2019s no reason, though,\n     to do that before the Court making a determination\n     whether Mr. Noetzel understands what\u2019s taking place\n     here today in his request to represent himself?\n\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f           [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I\u2019ve not seen any\n     reason personally to doubt that Mr. Noetzel is competent\n     to make the decision to represent himself, but I\u2019m not an\n     expert.\n           THE COURT: Certainly. And I understand that.\n     Mr. Noetzel, what [counsel] is saying and what I\u2019m going\n     to do, whether I allow you to represent yourself at this\n     stage or not, is appoint an expert to have you evaluated\n     just to ensure. I don\u2019t see any reason to believe in any\n     way that you\u2019re incompetent to proceed.\n           THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, sir.\n           THE COURT: But I\u2019m going to have that evaluation\n     done out of the abundance of caution because of the\n     severity of the possible sentences here. Do you\n     understand that?\n           THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n     Following this exchange, the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s\n\nrequest for self-representation and appointed the public defender\u2019s\n\noffice as standby counsel.\n\n  The Trial Court Makes Additional Findings Regarding Self-\nRepresentation, Renews the Offer of Counsel, Accepts Noetzel\u2019s\n          Guilty Plea, and Finds Noetzel Competent\n\n     Immediately after ruling that Noetzel could represent himself,\n\nthe trial court addressed Noetzel\u2019s request \u201cto either demand a\n\nspeedy trial or enter a plea,\u201d and explained to Noetzel that he could\n\ndemand a speedy trial if he wanted to go to trial, but that if he\n\nwanted to plead guilty, he would be \u201cgiving up [his] right to a trial.\u201d\n\nNoetzel stated, \u201cI would like to plead guilty.\u201d The trial court then\n\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\frecessed so that Noetzel could read the offer of plea that the State\n\nhad prepared. When the hearing resumed, the State represented\n\nthat Noetzel had read and signed the offer of plea form.\n\n     Before addressing Noetzel\u2019s plea, the trial court made the\n\nfollowing, additional ruling with respect to Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation:\n\n          Mr. Noetzel, I already advised you, if I didn\u2019t, that\n     I\u2019m going to allow you to represent yourself. Mr.\n     Marshburn and his office, the Office of the Public\n     Defender, will be appointed at your request only as\n     standby counsel and that the decisions that you\u2019ll be\n     making with [sic] be yours. If you have any questions\n     you don\u2019t want to ask me, you can ask Mr. Marshburn. .\n     . . And that I do find it to be freely and voluntarily\n     entered, and knowingly as well.\n\n     Next, the trial court asked whether Noetzel was \u201cwithdrawing\n\n[his] speedy trial demand and wanting to enter a plea,\u201d and Noetzel\n\nconfirmed that was correct. The trial court then renewed the offer\n\nof counsel, which Noetzel rejected. Before accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea,\n\nthe trial court explained the consequences of pleading guilty to all\n\nfour of the charges, including that the penalty Noetzel would receive\n\nfor the first-degree murder of Eastwood would be either life in\n\nprison without parole or death. The trial court further apprised\n\nNoetzel that, by pleading guilty, he would be waiving his\n\n\n                                 - 12 -\n\fconstitutional rights to remain silent, to a jury trial, and to confront\n\nwitnesses, all of which Noetzel indicated he understood but wanted\n\nto waive and plead guilty. Noetzel confirmed that no one had\n\npromised him anything or threatened him in exchange for his plea;\n\nsaid that he was pleading guilty \u201c[b]ecause I am guilty\u201d; and further\n\nsaid that he did not require additional time to consider his strategy\n\nbecause he had already had \u201c210 days to ponder\u201d \u201cthe charges\n\nagainst [him] and any defenses that [he] might have.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel also confirmed that he had no objection to the factual\n\nbasis offered by the State for the four offenses to which he sought to\n\nplead guilty; with respect to the first-degree murder of Eastwood,\n\nthe factual basis was, \u201c[T]he defendant was an inmate at Mayo\n\nCorrectional Institute and did kill a fellow inmate by the name of\n\nDonald Eastwood by premeditated murder . . . in Lafayette County,\n\nFlorida.\u201d\n\n     Before accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea, the trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether there were any further suggested lines of inquiry. Noetzel\u2019s\n\nnow-standby counsel responded, \u201cAgain, Your Honor, I would say\n\nthis should all be done with the caveat that he hasn\u2019t been\n\nevaluated by an expert.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cThat\u2019s what I plan\n\n\n                                 - 13 -\n\fto do,\u201d accepted Noetzel\u2019s guilty plea, and also found Noetzel\n\ncompetent, ruling as follows:\n\n     Mr. Noetzel, I\u2019m going to accept your plea. I find it to be\n     freely and voluntarily made. There are facts to support\n     it. And it\u2019s all done with the cautionary issues that I\u2019ve\n     raised here with you regarding representing yourself and\n     waiving your right to have an attorney present and\n     represent you throughout the proceeding, and it\u2019s done\n     knowingly, intelligently. I do find you to be at this point\n     in time to be competent and intelligent and alert and the\n     plea is accepted.\n\n     After accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea and finding him competent, the\n\ntrial court explained that it was going \u201cto have [Noetzel] evaluated to\n\nmake sure that [he is] competent to proceed\u201d and reiterated that\n\nthis was being done \u201cout of [an] abundance of caution.\u201d\n\n   The Trial Court Orders a Competency Evaluation and the\n         Expert Finds Noetzel Competent to Proceed\n\n     In accordance with its ruling at the January 21 motion\n\nhearing, the day after the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s request for\n\nself-representation, accepted his guilty plea, and found him\n\ncompetent, it appointed Dr. Umesh M. Mhatre \u201cto assess and\n\nevaluate [Noetzel] concerning his competency to stand trial and/or\n\nnegotiate a disposition of his case.\u201d Consistent with the trial court\u2019s\n\noral pronouncement that the evaluation was being ordered \u201cout of\n\n\n\n                                - 14 -\n\fthe abundance of caution because of the severity of the possible\n\nsentences here,\u201d not because of bona fide reason to doubt Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncompetency, the appointment order states that the evaluation was\n\nbeing ordered based on \u201cconcerns raised by the Court, the State,\n\nand the Defense concerning the gravity of [Noetzel\u2019s] decisions\u201d to\n\ndischarge counsel and waive his right to a jury trial.\n\n     Dr. Mhatre reviewed the arrest reports and Noetzel\u2019s records\n\nfrom the Department of Corrections (DOC), examined Noetzel on\n\nFebruary 1, 2020, and found him competent to proceed. In\n\naddressing Noetzel\u2019s \u201cCompetency to Proceed,\u201d Dr. Mhatre\u2019s written\n\nreport includes this finding: \u201cThe patient understands the nature of\n\ncharges against him and has already pled guilty. He has released\n\nhis attorney because he wants to represent himself in the\n\nsentencing phase.\u201d The \u201cMedical and Psychiatric History\u201d portions\n\nof the report indicate that Noetzel \u201cdid not know what medications\n\nhe is currently receiving,\u201d that Noetzel \u201cdenies having any inpatient\n\npsychiatric care,\u201d but \u201chas received outpatient treatment in the\n\nDepartment of Corrections,\u201d and that Noetzel \u201cacknowledges having\n\nlow moods, insomnia, and anhedonia\u201d and \u201cstates that his prison\n\nlifestyle is what\u2019s making him depressed.\u201d The report notes that Dr.\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\fMhatre\u2019s review of Noetzel\u2019s DOC records revealed that Noetzel \u201chas\n\na past diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder and was on Trileptal\n\n300 mg twice a day and Effexor 150 mg a day.\u201d\n\n     Additionally, the \u201cMental Status Examination\u201d portion of Dr.\n\nMhatre\u2019s report includes these findings:\n\n           During the interview, [Noetzel] was polite,\n     respectful, and provided a lot of spontaneous\n     information. He was quick to acknowledge his problems\n     with his bad temper and impulsive behavior. He admits\n     having a past history of depression because of his prison\n     lifestyle, but the medications definitely seem[] to have\n     helped.\n           There was no evidence to auditory, visual, tactile,\n     olfactory, or kinesthetic hallucinations. He is oriented to\n     time, place, person. His memory is intact for immediate,\n     recent, remote events. There were no signs of pressured\n     speech, flight of ideas, or thought blocking.\n           The patient is currently not suicidal or homicidal.\n     His insight into his problem is adequate and his social\n     judgment is significantly impaired.\n\n     Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report lists the following as his \u201cImpression\u201d of\n\nNoetzel\u2019s mental health: (1) major depressive disorder; (2) history of\n\nsubstance abuse; and (3) antisocial personality disorder. With\n\nrespect to \u201cRecommendations,\u201d the report states that Noetzel\n\n\u201cacknowledges that the medications have helped him and he wants\n\nto stay on them as long as he needs to. He knows without the\n\nmedications his condition could deteriorate.\u201d\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fII. THE BENCH PENALTY-PHASE PROCEEDING\n\n The Trial Court Renews the Offer of Counsel and Renews the\n     Competency Finding in Light of the Expert\u2019s Report\n\n     The bench penalty-phase proceeding, which subsumed the\n\nSpencer4 hearing, occurred on February 21, 2020, and was a joint\n\npenalty phase with Noetzel\u2019s codefendant Bell, who had also\n\nexercised his right to self-representation, pleaded no contest, and,\n\nlike Noetzel, had waived his right to a penalty-phase jury. Before\n\ncommencing the penalty phase, the trial court renewed the offer of\n\ncounsel, which Noetzel rejected.\n\n     Before accepting argument or evidence, the trial court again\n\naddressed the issue of Noetzel\u2019s competency to proceed.\n\nSpecifically, the trial court stated that it had previously found\n\nNoetzel to be competent to proceed but \u201c[o]ut of the abundance of\n\ncaution,\u201d had ordered him \u201cexamined for competency\u201d and had\n\nsince received Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report. The trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether Noetzel took \u201cany exception to the Court considering [the]\n\nreport . . . and [Dr. Mhatre\u2019s] determination that [Noetzel is]\n\n\n\n\n     4. Spencer v. State, 615 So. 2d 688 (Fla. 1993).\n\n\n                                 - 17 -\n\fcompetent to represent [himself] or competent to proceed,\u201d and\n\nNoetzel responded that he \u201cwas happy with everything [Dr. Mhatre]\n\nsaid.\u201d\n\n     Based on the expert\u2019s evaluation, the trial court found that\n\nNoetzel was \u201ccompetent to proceed and there\u2019s no indication of any\n\nsort of mental infirmity or defect that would prevent [him] from doing\n\nso.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Noetzel indicated that he wanted to enter\n\nthe competency evaluation as mitigation, and the trial court\n\nexplained that Noetzel would have the ability to do that. After\n\nexplaining the penalty-phase proceedings that were to follow, the\n\ntrial court again renewed the offer of counsel, and Noetzel again\n\nindicated that he was certain he wanted to continue to represent\n\nhimself.\n\nThe Trial Court Conducts the Bench Penalty-Phase Proceeding\n\n     Thereafter, the State proceeded with its opening statement,\n\narguing that it intended to prove five aggravating circumstances in\n\nsupport of imposition of the death penalty: (1) prior violent felony\n\nbased on the contemporaneous attempted murder of Officer\n\nNewman; (2) under sentence of imprisonment for a felony; (3)\n\nEastwood\u2019s murder was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fexercise of any government function or the enforcement of laws\n\nbecause Eastwood\u2019s murder prevented him from completing his\n\nlawful sentence; (4) especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC);\n\nand (5) cold, calculated, and premeditated without any pretense of\n\nmoral or legal justification (CCP). Neither Noetzel nor Bell\n\npresented an opening statement.\n\n     The State presented the testimony of five witnesses, namely\n\ntwo corrections officers, both of whom Noetzel cross-examined; two\n\ninvestigators to whom Noetzel had confessed; and the medical\n\nexaminer who performed the victim\u2019s autopsy. The State also\n\nintroduced numerous exhibits including, without objection, certified\n\ncopies of Noetzel\u2019s judgments and sentences. During the State\u2019s\n\ncase, Noetzel joined Bell in objecting to lines of questions related to\n\nOfficer Newman, based on their joint argument, advanced by Bell,\n\nthat evidence of their attempt to murder Officer Newman should not\n\nsupport the application of the prior violent felony aggravator.\n\n     After the State rested, Bell and Noetzel called only themselves\n\nas witnesses. Noetzel took responsibility for his actions and\n\nintroduced his competency evaluation into evidence as mitigation.\n\nNoetzel also made the following statement in response to the trial\n\n\n                                 - 19 -\n\fcourt\u2019s question as to whether he had \u201canything [he] want[ed] the\n\nCourt to be aware of, any matters in mitigation?\u201d:\n\n            The only thing that\u2019s for mitigation that we\u2019ve\n     already gone through that I\u2019ve explained to you when you\n     were asking about my competency and I answered all\n     your questions.\n            Everything is stated quite plainly. There\u2019s nothing\n     more to say, you know.\n            I have no regrets for anything I\u2019ve done.\n            Talking about my childhood or my family or any of\n     those things, I don\u2019t think they have any bearing.\n            Everything -- if you have a question, I\u2019ll answer it.\n     I\u2019ve got no problem with it.\n            And I was quite, you know, happy to say I\u2019m guilty\n     for what I did.\n            Other than that, I don\u2019t understand the mitigating\n     part and other. You know, talking about regrets,\n     problems in childhood, you know, those things are in the\n     past, you know. People who use things, oh, I was beat\n     up as a child. That\u2019s not a mitigating circumstance as\n     far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s an excuse. You know, you did\n     what you did. You knew what you were doing, right or\n     wrong. We all know it.\n            The State, I\u2019m quite content with that and I think\n     you for letting me talk.\n            As I said, if y\u2019all or anybody else has any questions,\n     I\u2019ll answer them.\n\n     Following closing arguments, the trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether there was anything further that should occur prior to the\n\nsentencing hearing, at which point the State asked the trial court to\n\norder a PSI for both Bell and Noetzel in light of the minimal\n\nmitigation presented. Over Bell\u2019s objection that a PSI was not\n\n\n                                - 20 -\n\frequired because both he and Noetzel had presented some\n\nmitigation, the trial court exercised its discretion to \u201corder one\n\nanyway.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel cooperated with the PSI, which contains a \u201cPhysical\n\nand Mental Health\u201d section that denotes Noetzel\u2019s \u201chealth status\u201d as\n\n\u201cgood\u201d and includes the following remark: \u201cThe subject stated that\n\nhe is in good physical health and does not have mental health\n\nissues. He does state that he was diagnosed with paranoid\n\nschizophrenia.\u201d\n\nIII. THE FINAL PENALTY-PHASE HEARING\n\n     Before commencing the final penalty-phase hearing on March\n\n13, 2020, the trial court renewed the offer of counsel, which Noetzel\n\nrejected. In renewing the offer of counsel, the trial court (1)\n\nreminded Noetzel of the \u201clong litany of questions\u201d it had gone\n\nthrough with him \u201cregarding [his] decision to represent [himself],\u201d\n\n(2) asked Noetzel whether he recalled those questions and his\n\nanswers and whether he had any questions, and (3) inquired as to\n\nwhether anyone had \u201cthreatened or forced\u201d Noetzel to get him to\n\nreject counsel. Noetzel indicated that he understood his right to\n\ncounsel and confirmed that he still wished to proceed without\n\n\n                                 - 21 -\n\fcounsel and that no one had threatened him in regard to his\n\ndecision.\n\n     Next, the trial court asked Noetzel whether he had received a\n\ncopy of the PSI and, if so, whether he had any \u201cadditions or\n\ncorrections or points of clarification\u201d to it. Noetzel confirmed that\n\nhe had received a copy, agreed that the information in it was\n\naccurate, and stated that he did not have anything to add.\n\n     After hearing argument from the State regarding the four\n\ncounts on which Noetzel was to be sentenced, the trial court\n\ninquired of Noetzel as to whether he had \u201cany further matters in\n\nmitigation other than those that [he] presented in the penalty\n\nphase.\u201d Noetzel stated that he did not have additional mitigation to\n\npresent and that he did not wish to address the court \u201cas far as\n\nmitigation and recommendation . . . of the sentence.\u201d 5\n\n     The trial court then proceeded to the sentencing portion of the\n\nhearing during which it adjudicated Noetzel guilty of each crime to\n\nwhich he had pleaded guilty and sentenced Noetzel to death for\n\n\n\n\n     5. This portion of the final hearing constituted additional\nproceedings in furtherance of the requirements of Spencer, 615 So.\n2d at 690-91.\n\n                                 - 22 -\n\fEastwood\u2019s first-degree murder, to life for the attempted first-degree\n\nmurder of Officer Newman with a weapon, to thirty years for\n\nconspiracy to commit first-degree murder of Officer Newman, and to\n\nfifteen years for possession of a weapon in prison, with all\n\nsentences to run concurrent with one another.\n\n                       The Sentencing Order\n\n     The trial court\u2019s sentencing order reflects its rulings that\n\nNoetzel \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel,\u201d\n\nand that Noetzel\u2019s \u201cguilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and\n\nvoluntary.\u201d The order also reflects that the trial court rejected one\n\nof the five statutory aggravating circumstances argued by the State,\n\nnamely that the capital felony was committed to disrupt or hinder\n\nthe lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement\n\nof laws. However, the trial court found that the State had proven\n\nthe existence of the other four aggravators it had argued beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and assigned each the noted weight: (1) the\n\ncapital felony was committed by a person previously convicted of a\n\nfelony and under sentence of imprisonment (great weight); (2) the\n\ndefendant was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a\n\nfelony involving the use or threat of violence to the person (great\n\n\n                                - 23 -\n\fweight); (3) the capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or\n\ncruel (HAC) (very great weight); and (4) the capital felony was a\n\nhomicide and was committed in a cold, calculated, and\n\npremeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal\n\njustification (CCP) (very great weight).\n\n     The trial court considered statutory mitigating circumstances\n\nbut found that none had been established. However, it found the\n\nfollowing three nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and assigned\n\neach the noted weight: (1) the defendant cooperated during the\n\ninvestigation of and prosecution for the killing of Mr. Eastwood\n\n(little weight); (2) the defendant exhibited appropriate courtroom\n\nbehavior (little weight); and (3) the defendant was previously\n\ndiagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (little weight).\n\n     The trial court addressed Noetzel\u2019s previous diagnosis as\n\nfollows:\n\n          According to statements made by the Defendant\n     during the preparation of the PSI, he had been diagnosed\n     with paranoid schizophrenia. The Defendant did not\n     mention any mental health issues during the penalty\n     phase or present evidence to support it. Additionally, he\n     reported being in \u201cgood physical health\u201d and was found\n     competent not only to proceed but also to waive counsel\n     and represent himself.\n\n\n\n                                 - 24 -\n\f           Court\u2019s Finding. Therefore, given the Defendant\u2019s\n     complete candor with this Court concerning his\n     involvement in the crimes, this Court finds no reason to\n     question or doubt this diagnosis. However, without\n     more, a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia cannot\n     justify or excuse the Defendant\u2019s conduct. Nonetheless,\n     this Court assigns this mitigating circumstance little\n     weight.\n\n     In sentencing Noetzel to death, the trial court further found\n\n\u201cthat the aggravating factors clearly, convincingly, and beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel now appeals.\n\n                              ANALYSIS\n\n     In this direct appeal, we address three issues. Noetzel briefed\n\ntwo issues in which he challenges\u2014on several grounds related to\n\nhis competency and the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s Faretta\n\ninquiry\u2014the trial court\u2019s rulings allowing him to waive counsel and\n\nrepresent himself. Noetzel\u2019s first issue centers on the trial court\u2019s\n\nhandling of his statement during the Faretta inquiry that he had\n\nbeen prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for depression and chronic back\n\npain that he was not taking \u201cat this moment.\u201d Noetzel\u2019s second\n\nissue concerns the trial court\u2019s acceptance, as nonstatutory\n\nmitigation, of his self-disclosure, made during the PSI, that he had\n\n\n\n                                 - 25 -\n\fbeen diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at an unspecified point\n\nin his past, before an expert found him competent to proceed and\n\nbefore the trial court found him competent. As the third issue, we\n\nconduct a mandatory review of Noetzel\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n      (1) Competency and the Right to Self-Representation\n\n     Noetzel first argues that the trial court erred in granting his\n\nrequest for self-representation because it failed to adequately\n\ninquire into his mental-health status, including by ordering a\n\ncompetency evaluation, before allowing him to represent himself.\n\nHe further claims that the trial court failed to \u201cmake[] a\n\ndetermination of record\u201d that he \u201cdoes not suffer from severe mental\n\nillness to the point where [he] is not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself\u201d within the meaning of Florida Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 3.111(d)(3).6\n\n\n\n\n     6. Noetzel also argues that the trial court failed to find that\nhis counsel waiver was \u201cintelligent.\u201d However, as the State correctly\nargues, the trial court made this finding in its sentencing order,\nruling as follows: \u201c[A] very lengthy and thorough Faretta inquiry was\nconducted pursuant to the Defendant\u2019s right and decision to\nrepresent himself. After it was determined that the Defendant\nknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, he was\npermitted to represent himself.\u201d\n\n                                - 26 -\n\f      We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a request for self-\n\nrepresentation for abuse of discretion, Knight v. State, 211 So. 3d 1,\n\n15 (Fla. 2016), and where, as here, the errors alleged on appeal\n\nwere not preserved, reversal is warranted only if the defendant\n\nestablishes fundamental error, see Hopkins v. State, 632 So. 2d\n\n1372, 1374 (Fla. 1994); see also \u00a7 924.051(3), Fla. Stat. (2020) (\u201cA\n\njudgment or sentence may be reversed on appeal only when an\n\nappellate court determines after a review of the complete record that\n\nprejudicial error occurred and was properly preserved in the trial\n\ncourt or, if not properly preserved, would constitute fundamental\n\nerror.\u201d).\n\n      Noetzel\u2019s arguments implicate three different standards. The\n\nfirst is the standard for competence to stand trial\u2014i.e., whether the\n\ndefendant has \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and has \u201ca\n\nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against\n\nhim.\u201d Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960) (quoting\n\nSolicitor General\u2019s suggestion). The Dusky standard is the same\n\nstandard of competence required to plead guilty or to waive the\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 27 -\n\fright to assistance of counsel. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389,\n\n391, 398, 402 (1993).\n\n     The second is the Faretta standard for measuring whether a\n\ncompetent defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel is knowing,\n\nvoluntary, and intelligent. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835.\n\n     The third is the competency standard to conduct trial\n\nproceedings without assistance of counsel, which is \u201csomewhat\n\nhigher\u201d than the Dusky competency standard. Woodbury v. State,\n\n320 So. 3d 631, 646 (Fla. 2021) (citing Wall v. State, 238 So. 3d\n\n127, 140 (Fla. 2018)). Specifically, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt has held that states may \u201cinsist upon representation by\n\ncounsel for those competent enough to stand trial under Dusky but\n\nwho still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they\n\nare not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\u201d\n\nIndiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164, 178 (2008); see also Fla. R.\n\nCrim. P. 3.111(d)(3) (implementing Edwards); Wall, 238 So. 3d at\n\n140-41 (\u201cUnder Edwards . . . there is a heightened competency\n\nstandard for actually representing oneself at trial; thus defendants\n\nmay be competent to waive counsel yet incompetent to represent\n\nthemselves.\u201d).\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\f     As explained below, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nunder any of these standards because (A) a competency hearing\n\nwas not required; (B) competent, substantial evidence supports the\n\ntrial court\u2019s findings that Noetzel\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel\n\nwas knowing, voluntary, and intelligent under Faretta; and (C) the\n\ntrial court was not required to find that Noetzel suffered from severe\n\nmental illness to the point that he was incompetent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself.\n\n     A. Competency\n\n     Noetzel first argues that his disclosure during the Faretta\n\ninquiry that he had been prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for depression\n\nand chronic back pain that he was not taking \u201cat this moment\u201d\n\nshould have resulted in further inquiry from the trial court.\n\nSpecifically, he contends that the trial court should have ordered a\n\ncompetency evaluation and withheld its ruling on his request for\n\nself-representation pending the results. However, because a\n\ncompetency hearing was not required under the facts of Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncase, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n     A criminal defendant has the right to not be proceeded against\n\nwhile mentally incompetent to stand trial, Pate v. Robinson, 383\n\n\n                                 - 29 -\n\fU.S. 375, 378 (1966), and the requirement to inquire as to the\n\ndefendant\u2019s competency is triggered as follows:\n\n     If, at any material stage of a criminal proceeding, the\n     court of its own motion, or on motion of counsel for the\n     defendant or for the state, has reasonable ground to\n     believe that the defendant is not mentally competent to\n     proceed, the court shall immediately enter its order\n     setting a time for a hearing to determine the defendant\u2019s\n     mental condition . . . .\n\nFla. R. Crim. P. 3.210(b).\n\n     In Godinez, the Supreme Court explained that a trial court is\n\n\u201cnot . . . required to make a competency determination in every case\n\nin which a defendant seeks to plead guilty or to waive his right to\n\ncounsel. As in any criminal case, a competency determination is\n\nnecessary only when a court has reason to doubt the defendant\u2019s\n\ncompetence.\u201d 509 U.S. at 401 n.13 (citing Drope v. Missouri, 420\n\nU.S. 162, 180-81 (1975); Pate, 383 U.S. at 385).\n\n     Moreover, in cases involving criminal defendants with histories\n\nof mental illness, this Court has recognized that \u201c[n]ot every\n\nmanifestation of mental illness demonstrates incompetence to stand\n\ntrial; rather, the evidence must indicate a present inability to assist\n\ncounsel or understand the charges.\u201d Barnes v. State, 124 So. 3d\n\n904, 913 (Fla. 2013) (quoting Card v. Singletary, 981 F.2d 481, 487-\n\n\n                                 - 30 -\n\f88 (11th Cir. 1992)); see also Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at 644\n\n(rejecting Woodbury\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in failing to\n\norder a competency hearing where, \u201c[l]ike the defendant in Barnes,\n\nWoodbury disclosed a history and diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but\n\nnothing about his behavior in court indicated a present inability to\n\nunderstand the proceedings against him or an inability to consult\n\nwith his standby counsel (or with counsel, had an attorney been\n\nappointed)\u201d); Nelson v. State, 43 So. 3d 20, 29 (Fla. 2010) (holding,\n\nin the context of rejecting a claim that trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to move for a competency determination, that a \u201csuicide\n\nattempt alone\u201d does not raise a \u201cpresumption\u201d of incompetency and\n\nthat \u201cthe administration of Mellaril, a powerful antipsychotic drug,\n\ndid not necessarily render [the defendant] incompetent\u201d).\n\n     Here, when the trial court questioned Noetzel regarding his\n\nmental health history during the Faretta inquiry, Noetzel disclosed\n\nthat he had been prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for \u201cdepression\u201d and\n\n\u201cchronic back pain\u201d and stated that he was not taking his\n\nprescribed medication \u201cat this moment.\u201d The trial court inquired\n\nfurther, and Noetzel clarified that his medication does not positively\n\nor negatively affect his ability to understand, but rather, \u201cjust kind\n\n\n                                 - 31 -\n\fof keeps [him] calm.\u201d Noetzel also confirmed that he was \u201cfully\n\ncapable\u201d of understanding and comprehending \u201ceverything\u201d that the\n\ntrial court was discussing with him.\n\n     The trial court had the advantage of observing Noetzel in\n\nperson and clearly did not witness anything that caused it to\n\nquestion Noetzel\u2019s competency. Further, a review of the record\n\nindicates nothing about Noetzel\u2019s behavior\u2014at any point before or\n\nafter the trial court granted his request for self-representation\u2014that\n\nwould arguably demonstrate a present inability to understand the\n\nproceedings against him or an inability to consult with standby\n\ncounsel as required to trigger a competency hearing. See Fla. R.\n\nCrim. P. 3.210(b); see also Barnes, 124 So. 3d at 913.\n\n     Noetzel\u2019s case sits in stark comparison to a case such as\n\nDrope, 420 U.S. at 179, where the trial court ignored instances that\n\nraised a bona fide doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency,\n\nincluding that the defendant had attempted suicide during the trial\n\nand had engaged in \u201cpronounced irrational behavior\u201d between the\n\ntime of the crime and the trial. There was no such behavior in\n\nNoetzel\u2019s case. To the contrary, Noetzel filed several pro se motions,\n\nwhich he followed up with a pro se letter. During all four of the\n\n\n                                - 32 -\n\fcourt proceedings\u2014(1) the first appearance and arraignment, (2) the\n\nmotion hearing, (3) the bench penalty-phase proceeding, and (4) the\n\nfinal penalty-phase hearing\u2014Noetzel demonstrated that he\n\nunderstood the legal issues; he articulated his strategy; he engaged\n\nwith the trial court\u2019s questioning; and his courtroom behavior was\n\nappropriate.\n\n     Moreover, the trial court ultimately did order a competency\n\nevaluation even though one was not necessary under the Pate\n\nstandard codified in rule 3.210(b). Specifically, after inquiring of\n\nthen-appointed defense counsel, who stated that he had \u201cnot seen\n\nany reason personally to doubt that Mr. Noetzel is competent to\n\nmake the decision to represent himself,\u201d the trial court stated that it\n\ndid not \u201csee any reason to believe in any way that [Noetzel was]\n\nincompetent to proceed.\u201d Nevertheless, despite finding Noetzel\n\ncompetent, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation \u201cout of\n\nthe abundance of caution because of the severity of the possible\n\nsentences here.\u201d Thereafter, the expert found Noetzel competent to\n\nproceed, and the trial court subsequently renewed its competency\n\nfinding based on the expert\u2019s report.\n\n     Under these facts, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\n                                 - 33 -\n\f     B. Self-Representation\n\n     A competent criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right\n\nto represent himself at trial. Tennis v. State, 997 So. 2d 375, 377-\n\n78 (Fla. 2008). A defendant\u2019s unequivocal request for self-\n\nrepresentation triggers the trial court\u2019s obligation to hold a Faretta\n\ninquiry, the purpose of which is to determine whether the waiver of\n\nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is knowing, voluntary, and\n\nintelligent. Tennis, 997 So. 2d at 378. Unlike the competency\n\ninquiry discussed above, which focuses on \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mental\n\ncapacity,\u201d i.e., \u201cwhether he has the ability to understand the\n\nproceedings,\u201d the \u201cpurpose of the \u2018knowing and voluntary\u2019 inquiry\u201d\n\nunder Faretta \u201cis to determine whether the defendant actually does\n\nunderstand the significance and consequences of a particular\n\ndecision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S.\n\nat 401 n.12.\n\n     Regarding the \u201cproper scope\u201d of the Faretta inquiry, this Court\n\nrecently reiterated \u201cthat once a court determines that a competent\n\ndefendant of his or own free will has \u2018knowingly and intelligently\u2019\n\nwaived the right to counsel, the dictates of Faretta are satisfied, the\n\ninquiry is over, and the defendant may proceed unrepresented.\u201d\n\n\n                                 - 34 -\n\fHooks v. State, 286 So. 3d 163, 168 (Fla. 2019) (quoting State v.\n\nBowen, 698 So. 2d 248, 251 (Fla. 1997)). In other words, \u201cthere are\n\nno \u2018magic words\u2019 under Faretta.\u201d Id. (quoting Potts v. State, 718 So.\n\n2d 757, 760 (Fla. 1998)). Rather, \u201c[t]he accused must only \u2018be made\n\naware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so\n\nthat the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and\n\nhis choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 167 (quoting Faretta,\n\n422 U.S. at 835). On review, the appellate court \u201cwill evaluate \u2018the\n\ndefendant\u2019s general understanding of his or her rights.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 168\n\n(quoting Potts, 718 So. 2d at 760).\n\n     In Noetzel\u2019s case, the trial court conducted a lengthy Faretta\n\ninquiry, during which it explained the dangers and disadvantages of\n\nself-representation and the advantages of being represented by\n\ncounsel. Noetzel now faults the trial court for not inquiring further\n\ninto his mental health status, but the record shows that during the\n\nFaretta inquiry, the trial court continued to question Noetzel until it\n\nwas satisfied that neither mental illness nor Noetzel\u2019s not taking his\n\nprescribed medication \u201cat this moment\u201d prevented Noetzel from\n\nunderstanding the rights being discussed.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 35 -\n\f     Further, there is no indication in the record that Noetzel failed\n\nto understand his rights or that he was not exercising his right to\n\nself-representation with his eyes open. To the contrary, Noetzel\n\nadmitted that he understood it was completely inadvisable to\n\nrepresent himself but explained that he wanted to do so to further\n\nhis strategy to quickly plead guilty because he was guilty and to\n\n\u201cstreamline\u201d the sentencing phase of the proceeding as much as\n\npossible. 7 Noetzel\u2019s disclosure of a mental illness does not preclude\n\nhim from waiving the right to counsel and proceeding pro se. Cf.\n\nWoodbury, 320 So. 3d at 647-48 (\u201cGiven that certain people with\n\nbipolar disorder function well and act rationally, we see no logic in\n\n\n\n\n      7. When the trial court questioned Noetzel as to why he\nwanted to waive a penalty-phase jury, Noetzel explained his\nstrategy, in part, as follows:\n\n           Why mess somebody else\u2019s life up? I\u2019ve already said\n     I\u2019m guilty. Every investigator that I\u2019ve sat in front of, I\u2019ve\n     walked them through step by step how I killed [Eastwood]\n     and the reasons that I wanted to kill that officer. Plain\n     and simple, walked them step by step. I have not\n     wavered from what I\u2019ve done.\n           There\u2019s no sense in bringing a jury involved and\n     messing up their lives, having to spend money to pay\n     people to come in her and uproot their lives when I can\n     just sit here with you and we can streamline this and be\n     done with it.\n\n                                 - 36 -\n\fcreating a per se rule or presumption that all individuals with\n\nbipolar disorder suffer so severely from mental illness that they are\n\nunable to carry out basic trial tasks without assistance.\u201d).\n\n     Because competent, substantial evidence supports the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s finding that Noetzel\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was\n\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent under Faretta, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in granting Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation.\n\n     C. Rule 3.111(d)(3)\n\n     Noetzel also argues that the trial court erred under the\n\n\u201csomewhat higher\u201d competency standard of rule 3.111(d)(3).\n\nWoodbury, 320 So. 3d at 646. We disagree.\n\n     Although the technical skill of a criminal defendant to\n\nrepresent himself is not part of the Faretta inquiry, \u201cthe\n\ngovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the\n\ntrial at times outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in acting as his\n\nown lawyer.\u201d Edwards, 554 U.S. at 177 (quoting Martinez v. Court\n\nof Appeal, 528 U.S. 152, 162 (2000)). Thus, the Supreme Court\n\nheld in Edwards that \u201cthe Constitution permits States to insist\n\nupon representation by counsel for those competent enough to\n\n\n                                 - 37 -\n\fstand trial under Dusky but who still suffer from severe mental\n\nillness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by themselves.\u201d Edwards, 554 U.S. at 178.\n\n     Following Edwards, this Court amended Florida Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 3.111(d)(3) to \u201cimplement the narrow limitation\n\nupon the right to self-representation recognized in Edwards,\u201d but\n\ndid so \u201c[w]ithout deciding whether Edwards compels states to\n\nprovide additional protection to severely mentally ill defendants.\u201d In\n\nre Amends. to Fla. Rule of Crim. Proc. 3.111, 17 So. 3d 272, 274 (Fla.\n\n2009). Rule 3.111(d)(3) thus authorizes trial courts to force counsel\n\nupon a competent criminal defendant who has waived the right to\n\ncounsel and seeks to represent himself at trial in the limited\n\ninstance where the defendant \u201csuffer[s] from severe mental illness\n\nto the point where [he] is not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself.\u201d\n\n     As an initial matter, the parties disagree as to whether rule\n\n3.111(d)(3) applies to a case like Noetzel\u2019s\u2014where the defendant\n\npleads guilty rather than proceed to trial but represents himself,\n\nwith standby counsel, during the penalty phase. However, we need\n\nnot resolve the open question of whether what happened in\n\n\n                                - 38 -\n\fNoetzel\u2019s case amounts to a defendant \u201cconduct[ing] trial\n\nproceedings by himself,\u201d within the meaning of rule 3.111(d). That\n\nis because, even if the rule applies to Noetzel\u2019s case, our precedent\n\nclearly establishes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby not forcing counsel upon Noetzel under the rule.\n\n     In Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at 647-48, after reviewing the record,\n\nwe rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his \u201cpurportedly erratic,\u201d\n\nid. at 648, \u201cbehavior in court, together with his bipolar diagnosis,\n\nrequired the trial court to find that [he] suffered from severe mental\n\nillness to the point of being incompetent to conduct the proceedings\n\nby himself,\u201d id. at 647. Under Woodbury, Noetzel\u2019s case is not even\n\nclose, as there is no \u201cpurportedly erratic\u201d behavior. Indeed, there is\n\nnothing in the record to indicate that Noetzel\u2019s mental illness\n\nmanifested in a way that would have precluded him from\n\nconducting trial proceedings by himself within the meaning of rule\n\n3.111(d)(3). To the contrary, the record shows that Noetzel filed\n\nvarious pro se motions, including a motion to compel a ruling on\n\nhis request for self-representation, and addressed them with the\n\ntrial court. During the bench penalty-phase proceeding, Noetzel\n\ncross-examined witnesses, objected to one of the State\u2019s exhibits,\n\n\n                                 - 39 -\n\fintroduced his competency evaluation into evidence, and made a\n\nstatement to the court that aligned with his previously explained\n\nstrategies of pleading guilty because he was guilty and of\n\nstreamlining the penalty-phase proceedings as much as possible.\n\nDuring all of the proceedings, Noetzel\u2019s interactions with the trial\n\ncourt were appropriate; he had no trouble following what was\n\nhappening or carrying out his previously articulated strategies.\n\nMoreover, before proceeding with the bench penalty phase, the trial\n\ncourt did, in fact, rule that Noetzel was \u201ccompetent to proceed and\n\nthere\u2019s no indication of any sort of mental infirmity or defect that\n\nwould prevent [him] from doing so.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports that finding. 8\n\n\n\n\n     8. Noetzel faults the trial court for limiting the competency\nevaluation that it ordered in an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d to his\ncompetency to proceed\u2014as opposed to also ordering evaluation of\nwhether he suffers from severe mental illness to the point he is not\ncompetent to conduct trial proceedings by himself within the\nmeaning of rule 3.111(d)(3). However, the Florida Statutes and this\nCourt\u2019s procedural rules governing the appointment of experts to\nevaluate competency address mental competence to proceed and\nrequire experts to detail specific findings regarding the defendant\u2019s\nmental capacity\u2014findings that were made by the expert in this\ncase. See \u00a7 916.12, Fla. Stat. (2020); Fla R. Crim. P. 3.211-3.212.\nThese provisions do not require additional findings from appointed\nexperts regarding the \u201csomewhat higher\u201d \u201ccompetency standard to\n\n                                 - 40 -\n\f     Accordingly, even assuming that rule 3.111(d)(3) applies, the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to find that Noetzel\n\nsuffered from severe mental illness to the point of being\n\nincompetent to conduct the penalty-phase proceedings by himself.\n\n              (2) Noetzel\u2019s Disclosure During the PSI\n\n     In his second issue, Noetzel argues that even if the trial court\n\ndid not initially err by granting his request for self-representation, it\n\nerred by continuing to allow him to represent himself at the final\n\npenalty-phase hearing that occurred on March 13, 2020, following\n\nthe PSI. More specifically, Noetzel claims that because the trial\n\ncourt accepted, as nonstatutory mitigation, his self-disclosure\n\nduring the PSI that he had been diagnosed with paranoid\n\nschizophrenia at an unspecified point in his past, the trial court\n\nwas required to conduct a new Faretta inquiry and revisit the issue\n\nof competency before accepting Noetzel\u2019s rejection of the renewed\n\noffer of counsel. These arguments were not preserved below, and\n\nwe hold that Noetzel has failed to establish an abuse of discretion\n\nby the trial court, let alone fundamental error.\n\n\n\nconduct trial proceedings without assistance.\u201d Woodbury, 320 So.\n3d at 646.\n\n                                 - 41 -\n\f     First, with respect to competency, the self-disclosure pertained\n\nto a diagnosis that occurred at some unspecified point in Noetzel\u2019s\n\npast, but before the trial court\u2019s interactions with Noetzel, before the\n\nexpert evaluated Noetzel and found him competent to proceed, and\n\nbefore the trial court\u2019s competency findings. The trial court\u2019s\n\nsubsequent acceptance of mitigation in the form of a past diagnosis\n\ndoes not change the competency calculus because mitigation\n\npertains to \u201cfactors in the defendant\u2019s background that would\n\nmitigate against imposition of the death penalty,\u201d \u00a7 921.141(7)(h),\n\nFla. Stat. (2020) (emphasis added), whereas competency pertains to\n\npresent ability, see Dusky, 362 U.S. at 402. And, again, as\n\naddressed under issue 1, there are no manifestations of mental\n\nillness or other behavior anywhere in the record that give rise to a\n\nbona fide doubt as to Noetzel\u2019s competence\u2014either to stand trial or,\n\nassuming rule 3.111(d)(3) applies, to conduct trial proceedings by\n\nhimself. See Dessaure v. State, 55 So. 3d 478, 482-83 (Fla. 2010)\n\n(\u201cOnce a defendant has been deemed competent, the presumption\n\nof competence continues throughout all subsequent proceedings. A\n\nsubsequent competency hearing is only required \u2018if a bona fide\n\nquestion as to the defendant\u2019s competency has been raised.\u2019 \u201d)\n\n\n                                 - 42 -\n\f(citation omitted) (quoting Boyd v. State, 910 So. 2d 167, 187 (Fla.\n\n2005)).\n\n     Second, the trial court\u2019s crediting of Noetzel\u2019s self-disclosure as\n\nmitigation did not mandate a new Faretta inquiry before the trial\n\ncourt could properly accept Noetzel\u2019s rejection of the renewed offer\n\nof counsel at the beginning of the final penalty-phase hearing. Our\n\nprecedent requires that the trial court renew the offer of counsel at\n\neach subsequent crucial stage of the proceeding. See Traylor v.\n\nState, 596 So. 2d 957, 968 (Fla. 1992) (explaining that, under the\n\nFlorida Constitution, \u201cthe defendant is entitled to decide at each\n\ncrucial stage of the proceedings whether he or she requires the\n\nassistance of counsel\u201d and that \u201cthe waiver [of counsel] applies only\n\nto the present stage and must be renewed at each subsequent\n\ncrucial stage where the defendant is unrepresented\u201d); see also Fla.\n\nR. Crim. P. 3.111(d)(5) (\u201cIf a waiver is accepted at any stage of the\n\nproceedings, the offer of assistance of counsel shall be renewed by\n\nthe court at each subsequent stage of the proceedings at which the\n\ndefendant appears without counsel.\u201d).\n\n     However, absent a substantial change in circumstances that\n\nwould cause the trial court to question its original ruling on the\n\n\n                                 - 43 -\n\fdefendant\u2019s request for self-representation, there is no concomitant\n\nrequirement to revisit Faretta every time the offer of counsel is\n\nsubsequently renewed and rejected. See Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at\n\n647 n.7 (\u201cWe do not suggest that all of these [renewed] offers [of\n\ncounsel] and Faretta inquiries were legally required. The record\n\nindicates that the trial court conducted so many inquiries to ensure\n\nthat the offer of counsel was renewed at all critical stages of the\n\nproceedings. Nothing in the record suggests that any of the\n\ninquiries were prompted by new concerns about [the defendant\u2019s]\n\nbehavior or competency.\u201d); see also United States v. Nunez, 137 F.\n\nApp\u2019x 214, 215 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201cIf we were to place upon the\n\ndistrict court an obligation to reassess its Faretta hearing decision,\n\nwe would do so only on a showing of a substantial change in\n\ncircumstances since the initial hearing.\u201d). 9\n\n     In this case, when Noetzel rejected the renewed offer of\n\ncounsel at the final penalty-phase hearing, there had been no\n\n\n\n      9. To the extent the First District Court of Appeal held to the\ncontrary in Howard v. State, 147 So. 3d 1040, 1043 (Fla. 1st DCA\n2014), when it stated (emphasis ours) that \u201c[f]ailure to renew the\noffer of counsel at a critical stage and conduct a Faretta inquiry if\nthe defendant rejects the renewed offer is per se reversible error,\u201d we\ndisapprove Howard.\n\n                                 - 44 -\n\fchange of circumstances that should have caused the trial court to\n\nquestion its finding from the January 21, 2020, motion hearing that\n\nNoetzel knowingly, intelligently, and voluntary exercised his right to\n\nself-representation under Faretta. Moreover, even though it would\n\nnot have been an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have\n\naccepted Noetzel\u2019s representation that he wanted to continue pro se,\n\nthe trial court actually did revisit Faretta, at least in part, before\n\npermitting Noetzel to do so by (1) reminding Noetzel of the \u201clong\n\nlitany of questions\u201d it had gone through with him \u201cregarding [his]\n\ndecision to represent [himself],\u201d (2) asking Noetzel whether he\n\nrecalled those questions and his answers and whether he had any\n\nquestions, and (3) inquiring as to whether anyone had \u201cthreatened\n\nor forced\u201d Noetzel to get him to reject counsel. Noetzel indicated\n\nthat he understood his right to counsel and confirmed that he still\n\nwished to proceed without counsel and that no one had threatened\n\nhim in regard to his decision.\n\n     In our view, the trial court did everything right. It certainly did\n\nnot fundamentally err.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 45 -\n\f                            (3) Guilty Plea\n\n     Because we have rejected Noetzel\u2019s argument that the trial\n\ncourt erred by finding him competent to waive counsel and because\n\nthe competency standards for waiving the right to counsel, pleading\n\nguilty, and standing trial are all the same Dusky standard, it follows\n\nthat Noetzel was competent to plead guilty immediately after his\n\ncounsel waiver. See Godinez, 509 U.S. at 391, 398, 402.\n\n     However, where the defendant\u2019s guilty plea results in a\n\nsentence of death, our mandatory obligation to review whether\n\nsufficient evidence supports the first-degree murder conviction, see\n\nFla. R. App. P. 9.142(a)(5), requires a review of the guilty plea,\n\nunder the following standard:\n\n     \u201c[W]hen a defendant has pled guilty to the charges\n     resulting in a penalty of death, this Court\u2019s review shifts\n     to the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary nature of that\n     plea.\u201d Winkles v. State, 894 So. 2d 842, 847 (Fla. 2005)\n     (quoting Lynch v. State, 841 So. 2d 362, 375 (Fla. 2003)).\n     Thus, . . . the Court must \u201cscrutinize the plea to ensure\n     that the defendant was made aware of the consequences\n     of his plea, was apprised of the constitutional rights he\n     was waiving, and pled guilty voluntarily.\u201d Id. (quoting\n     Ocha [v. State], 826 So. 2d [956,] 965 [(Fla. 2002)]).\n\nDoty v. State, 170 So. 3d 731, 738 (Fla. 2015). In addition, the Doty\n\nCourt looked to \u201c[t]he factual basis for the plea\u201d to determine that\n\n\n\n                                 - 46 -\n\fthere was \u201ccompetent, substantial evidence to support the\n\nconviction for first-degree murder.\u201d 170 So. 3d at 739.\n\n     Noetzel\u2019s plea satisfies the Doty standard. The trial court\n\nadvised Noetzel of the constitutional rights that he would be waiving\n\nby pleading guilty, and Noetzel indicated that he understood. See\n\nGodinez, 509 U.S. at 397 n.7 (\u201cA criminal defendant waives three\n\nconstitutional rights when he pleads guilty: the privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, the right to a jury trial, and the right to confront\n\none\u2019s accusers.\u201d) (citing Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243\n\n(1969)). The trial court also reviewed the two possible sentences\n\nthat could result from a guilty plea, namely life in prison without\n\nthe possibility of parole or death, and Noetzel confirmed that he\n\nunderstood. Additionally, the trial court inquired into the\n\nvoluntariness of Noetzel\u2019s plea, and Noetzel stated that no one had\n\npromised him anything or threatened him in exchange for the plea.\n\nTo the contrary, Noetzel said that he was pleading guilty \u201c[b]ecause\n\nI am guilty.\u201d Finally, the factual basis the State provided for the\n\nplea, to which Noetzel stated he had no objection, is competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence to support Noetzel\u2019s conviction for first-degree\n\nmurder. See Doty, 170 So. 3d at 739.\n\n\n                                 - 47 -\n\f                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Noetzel\u2019s first-degree\n\nmurder conviction and sentence of death.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\nCANADY, C.J., and POLSTON, LAWSON, MU\u00d1IZ, COURIEL, and\nGROSSHANS, JJ., concur.\nLABARGA, J., concurs in result with an opinion.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION\nAND, IF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nLABARGA, J., concurring in result.\n\n     For the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in\n\nLawrence v.

Const., and for the reasons below affirm\n\nNoetzel\u2019s conviction and sentence of death.\n\n                           BACKGROUND\n\n     While serving a life sentence at Mayo Correctional Institution,\n\nNoetzel joined with his cellmate, Jesse Bell, in developing a plan to\n\nmurder corrections officer James Newman, whom they disliked, and\n\na fellow inmate, whom they would select at a later date. They\n\freduced their plan to writing in the following twelve steps, which\n\nthey titled \u201cCountdown To Extention\u201d [sic]:\n\n     1. Get on vegan diet\n     2. Get multiple tools\n     3. Get diagram of area\n     4. Find a gofer\n     5. Baby powder?\n     6. Patience!!!!\n     7. Pick a dick sucker\n     8. Background check on dick sucker\n     9. Pick a date\n     10. Commence dry runs - rehearsals\n     11. Exicute [sic]!\n     12. Work on spelling!!\n\n     In accordance with their plan, Noetzel and Bell got on a vegan\n\ndiet, which allowed them greater access to the area of the kitchen\n\nwhere Officer Newman worked. They used other inmates to scout\n\nthe layout of the kitchen, drew a diagram of the area where Officer\n\nNewman worked, and obtained pieces of metal and fence, which\n\nthey sharpened into weapons. They also selected their fellow\n\ninmate Donald H. Eastwood, Jr., to kill because they believed him\n\nto be homosexual and a child molester.\n\n     On June 26, 2019, after Noetzel lured Eastwood to his and\n\nBell\u2019s cell, Noetzel stabbed Eastwood in the eyes using their\n\nhomemade weapons while Bell restrained and manually choked\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fEastwood. Noetzel hung up a sheet to prevent anyone from seeing\n\ninside the cell, and after confirming Eastwood was dead, Noetzel\n\nand Bell covered Eastwood\u2019s body with a blanket and hid the body\n\nunder a bunk in the cell. They also cleaned up Eastwood\u2019s blood\n\nwith a towel and hung up a note in their cell that read, \u201cGOD\n\nHATES FAGS[.] FAGS HATE GOD! KILL ALL FAGS AND CHO-\n\nMOES! (And Any C.O.\u2019s Who F*ck with You!).\u201d\n\n     Noetzel and Bell then went to the prison\u2019s dining area, where\n\nthey attempted to stab Officer Newman to death with another of\n\ntheir homemade weapons. Other officers intervened in the attack\n\non Officer Newman, who was seriously injured but survived;\n\napprehended Noetzel and Bell in the dining hall; and discovered\n\nEastwood\u2019s body in Noetzel and Bell\u2019s cell, after Bell told a\n\ncorrections officer that there was a dead \u201cchomo\u201d in his cell, with\n\n\u201cchomo\u201d being prison slang for \u201cchild molester.\u201d\n\n     Both Noetzel and Bell subsequently waived their Miranda 1\n\nrights and provided detailed confessions to law enforcement. As the\n\n\n\n\n     1. Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\">384 U.S. 436</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftrial court\u2019s sentencing order accurately reflects, with respect to the\n\nfirst-degree murder of Eastwood, Noetzel\n\n     admitted that, after luring Mr. Eastwood to [the] cell\n     [Noetzel shared with Bell], [Noetzel] stabbed Mr.\n     Eastwood in the left eye, and his codefendant [Bell]\n     grabbed Mr. Eastwood from behind and began to \u201cchoke\n     him out.\u201d Mr. Eastwood did not immediately die, so\n     [Noetzel] attempted to stab him in the right eye while\n     [Bell] continued to \u201cchoke out\u201d Mr. Eastwood. At some\n     point during the attack, Mr. Eastwood began to question\n     the attack or beg for his life. Additionally, when [Bell]\n     initially released tension on Mr. Eastwood\u2019s neck, Mr.\n     Eastwood seemingly gasped for air. This caused [Bell] to\n     continue to strangle Mr. Eastwood even after he fell to\n     the ground. Eventually, Mr. Eastwood succumbed to\n     these injuries and died.\n\n     Consistent with Noetzel\u2019s description of the killing, the medical\n\nexaminer testified that Eastwood\u2019s cause of death was \u201csharp force\n\ntrauma to the left eye and brain[,] with neck compression,\u201d that the\n\nmanner of death was homicide, and that the puncture wound to\n\nEastwood\u2019s left eye\u2014which was \u201cbadly wounded\u201d and \u201cbasically just\n\na bloody pulp\u201d\u2014would have been \u201cparticularly painful.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel and Bell were jointly indicted on October 29, 2019, in\n\na five-count indictment for the first-degree premeditated murder of\n\nEastwood; the attempted first-degree murder of Officer Newman\n\nwith a weapon; and conspiracy to commit the first-degree murder of\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fOfficer Newman. In the fourth and fifth counts, Noetzel and Bell\n\nwere each indicted, respectively, on one count of possession of a\n\nweapon by an inmate.\n\n Noetzel Requests to Exercise His Right to Self-Representation\n                      and to Plead Guilty\n\n     At Noetzel\u2019s first appearance and arraignment, after appointed\n\ncounsel entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf, Noetzel personally\n\naddressed the trial court, stating that he would like a speedy trial,\n\nthat he \u201cwant[ed] to enter a plea of guilty right now,\u201d and that he\n\nwanted to represent himself and waive his right to counsel. The\n\npresiding judge informed Noetzel that he was filling in for the trial\n\njudge, and that it would be up to the assigned judge to conduct the\n\nFaretta 2 hearing required by Noetzel\u2019s unequivocal request for self-\n\nrepresentation. The presiding judge also told Noetzel, \u201c[I]f you want\n\nto put that in writing, that you want to represent yourself, by all\n\nmeans, do that,\u201d so that the assigned judge could \u201cconsider [it] at\n\nthe appropriate time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n     2. Faretta v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\">422 U.S. 806</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975).\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f     Thereafter, Noetzel put his pro se requests in writing, filing a\n\ndemand for speedy trial, a motion to proceed pro se, and a motion\n\nto discharge appointed counsel. Noetzel then filed a pro se \u201cnotice\n\nof inquiry\u201d and a pro se motion to compel a hearing. In addition,\n\nNoetzel filed a pro se letter questioning why no hearing had been\n\nheld on his motion to proceed pro se; in the letter, Noetzel reiterated\n\nthat he had \u201cattempted to enter a plea of guilty on all charges\u201d at\n\nhis arraignment. Noetzel\u2019s pro se letter explained his strategy:\n\n          I fully understand the dictates of Faretta and am\n     knowingly and intelligently waiving my right to counsel.\n     Thereafter, I will be entering a plea of guilty to preserve\n     judicial resources and bring closure to all parties\n     concerned with the outcome of this case.\n\n     Following Noetzel\u2019s pro se filings, three proceedings relevant to\n\nthe issues raised in this appeal occurred: (1) a motion hearing, at\n\nwhich the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation, found Noetzel competent, and accepted Noetzel\u2019s\n\nguilty plea, (2) a bench penalty-phase proceeding that occurred\n\nafter an expert evaluated Noetzel and found him competent, and (3)\n\na final penalty-phase hearing that occurred after the presentence\n\ninvestigation (PSI).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fI. THE MOTION HEARING\n\n     The Trial Court Conducts a Faretta Inquiry and Grants\n           Noetzel\u2019s Request for Self-Representation\n\n     On January 21, 2020, the trial judge assigned to Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncase held a hearing on Noetzel\u2019s pro se motions. At the hearing,\n\nNoetzel personally addressed the court and listed his requests,\n\nnamely that he wished to discharge counsel, represent himself,\n\nenter a plea of guilty on all charges, demand a speedy trial, \u201cwaive\n\nall [of his] rights to a jury,\u201d and be sentenced by the trial court.\n\n     The trial court first addressed Noetzel\u2019s request to invoke his\n\nright to self-representation by conducting a Faretta inquiry. The\n\nlengthy inquiry included explanations by the trial court of the\n\nadvantages of counsel and the disadvantages of self-representation,\n\nall of which Noetzel indicated that he understood. Noetzel\u2019s\n\nresponses to the trial court\u2019s questions went beyond simple \u201cyeses\u201d\n\nand \u201cnoes.\u201d For example, in response to the trial court\u2019s question\n\nas to whether Noetzel had \u201cany questions about the dangers and\n\ndisadvantages of representing [himself]\u201d that the trial court had\n\nexplained, Noetzel responded, \u201cOh, what does it say, a lawyer that\n\nrepresents himself has a fool for a client.\u201d Noetzel then stated that\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhe was \u201cstill prepared to go forward with it,\u201d even though he\n\nunderstood it was \u201c[c]ompletely inadvisable\u201d to proceed on his own.\n\nIn response to follow-up questions by the trial court as to why he\n\nwanted to represent himself despite knowing it was inadvisable to\n\ndo so, Noetzel explained that he wanted to quickly plead guilty\n\nbecause, \u201cI am guilty. There\u2019s no, if and buts about it. I did what I\n\ndid. Got no problem with it.\u201d 3\n\n     During the Faretta inquiry, the trial court also questioned\n\nNoetzel as to whether he had \u201cever been diagnosed and/or treated\n\nfor any mental illness or disorder.\u201d Noetzel responded,\n\n\u201cDepression.\u201d The trial court followed up by asking Noetzel if he\n\nwas taking any medication, and when Noetzel said he was not \u201cat\n\nthis moment,\u201d the trial court questioned whether Noetzel had been\n\nprescribed medication. When Noetzel said yes, the trial court asked\n\n\n\n\n      3. Other examples of Noetzel\u2019s level of engagement with the\ntrial court during the Faretta inquiry include that Noetzel appeared\nto banter with the trial court in discussing the potential deportation\nconsequences of a guilty plea or conviction, stating \u201cI really like the\nUnited States of America, sir,\u201d and in discussing the possible\nconsequences of a conviction if a sex-offender statute applied to any\nof his prior convictions, stating, \u201cI like that law and I don\u2019t fall\nunder it.\u201d\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fNoetzel to explain why he was not taking his prescribed medication,\n\nand Noetzel said that he \u201cwanted to have a clear mind before I got to\n\nthis point.\u201d Then, the following exchange occurred between Noetzel\n\nand the trial court:\n\n            THE COURT: Okay. Does the medication cloud\n     your mind?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir, but I just wanted to\n     make sure I didn\u2019t have anything in my system because I\n     knew that this was going to be one of the questions that\n     would be asked.\n            THE COURT: All right. So does the medication help\n     you to understand or hinder your ability to understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT: It\u2019s a low grade -- I don\u2019t\n     remember the name of it, it\u2019s in my file, for depression,\n     but it\u2019s also for back pain because I have chronic back\n     pain, but because it\u2019s a psych med, it\u2019s registered that\n     way.\n            THE COURT: All right. . . . [T]hen I assume, if\n     there is an effect, it would cloud your ability to\n     understand, affect your ability negatively to understand?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n            THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n            THE COURT: Does it enhance your ability to\n     understand, the medication?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, it just kind of keeps me\n     calm.\n            THE COURT: Okay. But --\n            THE DEFENDANT: There\u2019s no positive or negative\n     to it except for what I take for my back.\n            THE COURT: But it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to\n     understand or comprehend anything about what\u2019s taking\n     place?\n            THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f           THE COURT: Do you feel that you\u2019re fully capable\n     currently as you sit here now without your medication to\n     understand and comprehend everything that you and I\n     are talking about?\n           THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n     The trial court then moved on to additional lines of inquiry,\n\nincluding whether, if Noetzel were permitted to represent himself,\n\nhe would accept standby counsel. After the trial court explained\n\nthe role of standby counsel, Noetzel said he understood and\n\nconfirmed his desire for standby counsel.\n\n     Before ruling on Noetzel\u2019s request for self-representation, the\n\ntrial court inquired of the State and Noetzel\u2019s then-appointed\n\ndefense counsel as to whether either suggested further lines of\n\ninquiry. Defense counsel suggested that the trial court should use\n\nthe procedure followed in another recent capital case, where the\n\ntrial court \u201cappointed a couple of doctors to evaluate [the defendant]\n\nto make sure that he was competent to make the decisions to\n\nrepresent himself.\u201d Counsel\u2019s suggestion prompted the following\n\nexchange:\n\n          THE COURT: Okay. And there\u2019s no reason, though,\n     to do that before the Court making a determination\n     whether Mr. Noetzel understands what\u2019s taking place\n     here today in his request to represent himself?\n\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f           [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I\u2019ve not seen any\n     reason personally to doubt that Mr. Noetzel is competent\n     to make the decision to represent himself, but I\u2019m not an\n     expert.\n           THE COURT: Certainly. And I understand that.\n     Mr. Noetzel, what [counsel] is saying and what I\u2019m going\n     to do, whether I allow you to represent yourself at this\n     stage or not, is appoint an expert to have you evaluated\n     just to ensure. I don\u2019t see any reason to believe in any\n     way that you\u2019re incompetent to proceed.\n           THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, sir.\n           THE COURT: But I\u2019m going to have that evaluation\n     done out of the abundance of caution because of the\n     severity of the possible sentences here. Do you\n     understand that?\n           THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n\n     Following this exchange, the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s\n\nrequest for self-representation and appointed the public defender\u2019s\n\noffice as standby counsel.\n\n  The Trial Court Makes Additional Findings Regarding Self-\nRepresentation, Renews the Offer of Counsel, Accepts Noetzel\u2019s\n          Guilty Plea, and Finds Noetzel Competent\n\n     Immediately after ruling that Noetzel could represent himself,\n\nthe trial court addressed Noetzel\u2019s request \u201cto either demand a\n\nspeedy trial or enter a plea,\u201d and explained to Noetzel that he could\n\ndemand a speedy trial if he wanted to go to trial, but that if he\n\nwanted to plead guilty, he would be \u201cgiving up [his] right to a trial.\u201d\n\nNoetzel stated, \u201cI would like to plead guilty.\u201d The trial court then\n\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\frecessed so that Noetzel could read the offer of plea that the State\n\nhad prepared. When the hearing resumed, the State represented\n\nthat Noetzel had read and signed the offer of plea form.\n\n     Before addressing Noetzel\u2019s plea, the trial court made the\n\nfollowing, additional ruling with respect to Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation:\n\n          Mr. Noetzel, I already advised you, if I didn\u2019t, that\n     I\u2019m going to allow you to represent yourself. Mr.\n     Marshburn and his office, the Office of the Public\n     Defender, will be appointed at your request only as\n     standby counsel and that the decisions that you\u2019ll be\n     making with [sic] be yours. If you have any questions\n     you don\u2019t want to ask me, you can ask Mr. Marshburn. .\n     . . And that I do find it to be freely and voluntarily\n     entered, and knowingly as well.\n\n     Next, the trial court asked whether Noetzel was \u201cwithdrawing\n\n[his] speedy trial demand and wanting to enter a plea,\u201d and Noetzel\n\nconfirmed that was correct. The trial court then renewed the offer\n\nof counsel, which Noetzel rejected. Before accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea,\n\nthe trial court explained the consequences of pleading guilty to all\n\nfour of the charges, including that the penalty Noetzel would receive\n\nfor the first-degree murder of Eastwood would be either life in\n\nprison without parole or death. The trial court further apprised\n\nNoetzel that, by pleading guilty, he would be waiving his\n\n\n                                 - 12 -\n\fconstitutional rights to remain silent, to a jury trial, and to confront\n\nwitnesses, all of which Noetzel indicated he understood but wanted\n\nto waive and plead guilty. Noetzel confirmed that no one had\n\npromised him anything or threatened him in exchange for his plea;\n\nsaid that he was pleading guilty \u201c[b]ecause I am guilty\u201d; and further\n\nsaid that he did not require additional time to consider his strategy\n\nbecause he had already had \u201c210 days to ponder\u201d \u201cthe charges\n\nagainst [him] and any defenses that [he] might have.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel also confirmed that he had no objection to the factual\n\nbasis offered by the State for the four offenses to which he sought to\n\nplead guilty; with respect to the first-degree murder of Eastwood,\n\nthe factual basis was, \u201c[T]he defendant was an inmate at Mayo\n\nCorrectional Institute and did kill a fellow inmate by the name of\n\nDonald Eastwood by premeditated murder . . . in Lafayette County,\n\nFlorida.\u201d\n\n     Before accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea, the trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether there were any further suggested lines of inquiry. Noetzel\u2019s\n\nnow-standby counsel responded, \u201cAgain, Your Honor, I would say\n\nthis should all be done with the caveat that he hasn\u2019t been\n\nevaluated by an expert.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cThat\u2019s what I plan\n\n\n                                 - 13 -\n\fto do,\u201d accepted Noetzel\u2019s guilty plea, and also found Noetzel\n\ncompetent, ruling as follows:\n\n     Mr. Noetzel, I\u2019m going to accept your plea. I find it to be\n     freely and voluntarily made. There are facts to support\n     it. And it\u2019s all done with the cautionary issues that I\u2019ve\n     raised here with you regarding representing yourself and\n     waiving your right to have an attorney present and\n     represent you throughout the proceeding, and it\u2019s done\n     knowingly, intelligently. I do find you to be at this point\n     in time to be competent and intelligent and alert and the\n     plea is accepted.\n\n     After accepting Noetzel\u2019s plea and finding him competent, the\n\ntrial court explained that it was going \u201cto have [Noetzel] evaluated to\n\nmake sure that [he is] competent to proceed\u201d and reiterated that\n\nthis was being done \u201cout of [an] abundance of caution.\u201d\n\n   The Trial Court Orders a Competency Evaluation and the\n         Expert Finds Noetzel Competent to Proceed\n\n     In accordance with its ruling at the January 21 motion\n\nhearing, the day after the trial court granted Noetzel\u2019s request for\n\nself-representation, accepted his guilty plea, and found him\n\ncompetent, it appointed Dr. Umesh M. Mhatre \u201cto assess and\n\nevaluate [Noetzel] concerning his competency to stand trial and/or\n\nnegotiate a disposition of his case.\u201d Consistent with the trial court\u2019s\n\noral pronouncement that the evaluation was being ordered \u201cout of\n\n\n\n                                - 14 -\n\fthe abundance of caution because of the severity of the possible\n\nsentences here,\u201d not because of bona fide reason to doubt Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncompetency, the appointment order states that the evaluation was\n\nbeing ordered based on \u201cconcerns raised by the Court, the State,\n\nand the Defense concerning the gravity of [Noetzel\u2019s] decisions\u201d to\n\ndischarge counsel and waive his right to a jury trial.\n\n     Dr. Mhatre reviewed the arrest reports and Noetzel\u2019s records\n\nfrom the Department of Corrections (DOC), examined Noetzel on\n\nFebruary 1, 2020, and found him competent to proceed. In\n\naddressing Noetzel\u2019s \u201cCompetency to Proceed,\u201d Dr. Mhatre\u2019s written\n\nreport includes this finding: \u201cThe patient understands the nature of\n\ncharges against him and has already pled guilty. He has released\n\nhis attorney because he wants to represent himself in the\n\nsentencing phase.\u201d The \u201cMedical and Psychiatric History\u201d portions\n\nof the report indicate that Noetzel \u201cdid not know what medications\n\nhe is currently receiving,\u201d that Noetzel \u201cdenies having any inpatient\n\npsychiatric care,\u201d but \u201chas received outpatient treatment in the\n\nDepartment of Corrections,\u201d and that Noetzel \u201cacknowledges having\n\nlow moods, insomnia, and anhedonia\u201d and \u201cstates that his prison\n\nlifestyle is what\u2019s making him depressed.\u201d The report notes that Dr.\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\fMhatre\u2019s review of Noetzel\u2019s DOC records revealed that Noetzel \u201chas\n\na past diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder and was on Trileptal\n\n300 mg twice a day and Effexor 150 mg a day.\u201d\n\n     Additionally, the \u201cMental Status Examination\u201d portion of Dr.\n\nMhatre\u2019s report includes these findings:\n\n           During the interview, [Noetzel] was polite,\n     respectful, and provided a lot of spontaneous\n     information. He was quick to acknowledge his problems\n     with his bad temper and impulsive behavior. He admits\n     having a past history of depression because of his prison\n     lifestyle, but the medications definitely seem[] to have\n     helped.\n           There was no evidence to auditory, visual, tactile,\n     olfactory, or kinesthetic hallucinations. He is oriented to\n     time, place, person. His memory is intact for immediate,\n     recent, remote events. There were no signs of pressured\n     speech, flight of ideas, or thought blocking.\n           The patient is currently not suicidal or homicidal.\n     His insight into his problem is adequate and his social\n     judgment is significantly impaired.\n\n     Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report lists the following as his \u201cImpression\u201d of\n\nNoetzel\u2019s mental health: (1) major depressive disorder; (2) history of\n\nsubstance abuse; and (3) antisocial personality disorder. With\n\nrespect to \u201cRecommendations,\u201d the report states that Noetzel\n\n\u201cacknowledges that the medications have helped him and he wants\n\nto stay on them as long as he needs to. He knows without the\n\nmedications his condition could deteriorate.\u201d\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fII. THE BENCH PENALTY-PHASE PROCEEDING\n\n The Trial Court Renews the Offer of Counsel and Renews the\n     Competency Finding in Light of the Expert\u2019s Report\n\n     The bench penalty-phase proceeding, which subsumed the\n\nSpencer4 hearing, occurred on February 21, 2020, and was a joint\n\npenalty phase with Noetzel\u2019s codefendant Bell, who had also\n\nexercised his right to self-representation, pleaded no contest, and,\n\nlike Noetzel, had waived his right to a penalty-phase jury. Before\n\ncommencing the penalty phase, the trial court renewed the offer of\n\ncounsel, which Noetzel rejected.\n\n     Before accepting argument or evidence, the trial court again\n\naddressed the issue of Noetzel\u2019s competency to proceed.\n\nSpecifically, the trial court stated that it had previously found\n\nNoetzel to be competent to proceed but \u201c[o]ut of the abundance of\n\ncaution,\u201d had ordered him \u201cexamined for competency\u201d and had\n\nsince received Dr. Mhatre\u2019s report. The trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether Noetzel took \u201cany exception to the Court considering [the]\n\nreport . . . and [Dr. Mhatre\u2019s] determination that [Noetzel is]\n\n\n\n\n     4. Spencer v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618540\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618540/spencer-v-state/\">615 So. 2d 688</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1993).\n\n\n                                 - 17 -\n\fcompetent to represent [himself] or competent to proceed,\u201d and\n\nNoetzel responded that he \u201cwas happy with everything [Dr. Mhatre]\n\nsaid.\u201d\n\n     Based on the expert\u2019s evaluation, the trial court found that\n\nNoetzel was \u201ccompetent to proceed and there\u2019s no indication of any\n\nsort of mental infirmity or defect that would prevent [him] from doing\n\nso.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Noetzel indicated that he wanted to enter\n\nthe competency evaluation as mitigation, and the trial court\n\nexplained that Noetzel would have the ability to do that. After\n\nexplaining the penalty-phase proceedings that were to follow, the\n\ntrial court again renewed the offer of counsel, and Noetzel again\n\nindicated that he was certain he wanted to continue to represent\n\nhimself.\n\nThe Trial Court Conducts the Bench Penalty-Phase Proceeding\n\n     Thereafter, the State proceeded with its opening statement,\n\narguing that it intended to prove five aggravating circumstances in\n\nsupport of imposition of the death penalty: (1) prior violent felony\n\nbased on the contemporaneous attempted murder of Officer\n\nNewman; (2) under sentence of imprisonment for a felony; (3)\n\nEastwood\u2019s murder was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fexercise of any government function or the enforcement of laws\n\nbecause Eastwood\u2019s murder prevented him from completing his\n\nlawful sentence; (4) especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC);\n\nand (5) cold, calculated, and premeditated without any pretense of\n\nmoral or legal justification (CCP). Neither Noetzel nor Bell\n\npresented an opening statement.\n\n     The State presented the testimony of five witnesses, namely\n\ntwo corrections officers, both of whom Noetzel cross-examined; two\n\ninvestigators to whom Noetzel had confessed; and the medical\n\nexaminer who performed the victim\u2019s autopsy. The State also\n\nintroduced numerous exhibits including, without objection, certified\n\ncopies of Noetzel\u2019s judgments and sentences. During the State\u2019s\n\ncase, Noetzel joined Bell in objecting to lines of questions related to\n\nOfficer Newman, based on their joint argument, advanced by Bell,\n\nthat evidence of their attempt to murder Officer Newman should not\n\nsupport the application of the prior violent felony aggravator.\n\n     After the State rested, Bell and Noetzel called only themselves\n\nas witnesses. Noetzel took responsibility for his actions and\n\nintroduced his competency evaluation into evidence as mitigation.\n\nNoetzel also made the following statement in response to the trial\n\n\n                                 - 19 -\n\fcourt\u2019s question as to whether he had \u201canything [he] want[ed] the\n\nCourt to be aware of, any matters in mitigation?\u201d:\n\n            The only thing that\u2019s for mitigation that we\u2019ve\n     already gone through that I\u2019ve explained to you when you\n     were asking about my competency and I answered all\n     your questions.\n            Everything is stated quite plainly. There\u2019s nothing\n     more to say, you know.\n            I have no regrets for anything I\u2019ve done.\n            Talking about my childhood or my family or any of\n     those things, I don\u2019t think they have any bearing.\n            Everything -- if you have a question, I\u2019ll answer it.\n     I\u2019ve got no problem with it.\n            And I was quite, you know, happy to say I\u2019m guilty\n     for what I did.\n            Other than that, I don\u2019t understand the mitigating\n     part and other. You know, talking about regrets,\n     problems in childhood, you know, those things are in the\n     past, you know. People who use things, oh, I was beat\n     up as a child. That\u2019s not a mitigating circumstance as\n     far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s an excuse. You know, you did\n     what you did. You knew what you were doing, right or\n     wrong. We all know it.\n            The State, I\u2019m quite content with that and I think\n     you for letting me talk.\n            As I said, if y\u2019all or anybody else has any questions,\n     I\u2019ll answer them.\n\n     Following closing arguments, the trial court inquired as to\n\nwhether there was anything further that should occur prior to the\n\nsentencing hearing, at which point the State asked the trial court to\n\norder a PSI for both Bell and Noetzel in light of the minimal\n\nmitigation presented. Over Bell\u2019s objection that a PSI was not\n\n\n                                - 20 -\n\frequired because both he and Noetzel had presented some\n\nmitigation, the trial court exercised its discretion to \u201corder one\n\nanyway.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel cooperated with the PSI, which contains a \u201cPhysical\n\nand Mental Health\u201d section that denotes Noetzel\u2019s \u201chealth status\u201d as\n\n\u201cgood\u201d and includes the following remark: \u201cThe subject stated that\n\nhe is in good physical health and does not have mental health\n\nissues. He does state that he was diagnosed with paranoid\n\nschizophrenia.\u201d\n\nIII. THE FINAL PENALTY-PHASE HEARING\n\n     Before commencing the final penalty-phase hearing on March\n\n13, 2020, the trial court renewed the offer of counsel, which Noetzel\n\nrejected. In renewing the offer of counsel, the trial court (1)\n\nreminded Noetzel of the \u201clong litany of questions\u201d it had gone\n\nthrough with him \u201cregarding [his] decision to represent [himself],\u201d\n\n(2) asked Noetzel whether he recalled those questions and his\n\nanswers and whether he had any questions, and (3) inquired as to\n\nwhether anyone had \u201cthreatened or forced\u201d Noetzel to get him to\n\nreject counsel.

However, the trial court found that the State had proven\n\nthe existence of the other four aggravators it had argued beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and assigned each the noted weight: (1) the\n\ncapital felony was committed by a person previously convicted of a\n\nfelony and under sentence of imprisonment (great weight); (2) the\n\ndefendant was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a\n\nfelony involving the use or threat of violence to the person (great\n\n\n                                - 23 -\n\fweight); (3) the capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or\n\ncruel (HAC) (very great weight); and (4) the capital felony was a\n\nhomicide and was committed in a cold, calculated, and\n\npremeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal\n\njustification (CCP) (very great weight).\n\n     The trial court considered statutory mitigating circumstances\n\nbut found that none had been established. However, it found the\n\nfollowing three nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and assigned\n\neach the noted weight: (1) the defendant cooperated during the\n\ninvestigation of and prosecution for the killing of Mr. Eastwood\n\n(little weight); (2) the defendant exhibited appropriate courtroom\n\nbehavior (little weight); and (3) the defendant was previously\n\ndiagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (little weight).\n\n     The trial court addressed Noetzel\u2019s previous diagnosis as\n\nfollows:\n\n          According to statements made by the Defendant\n     during the preparation of the PSI, he had been diagnosed\n     with paranoid schizophrenia. The Defendant did not\n     mention any mental health issues during the penalty\n     phase or present evidence to support it. Additionally, he\n     reported being in \u201cgood physical health\u201d and was found\n     competent not only to proceed but also to waive counsel\n     and represent himself.\n\n\n\n                                 - 24 -\n\f           Court\u2019s Finding. Therefore, given the Defendant\u2019s\n     complete candor with this Court concerning his\n     involvement in the crimes, this Court finds no reason to\n     question or doubt this diagnosis. However, without\n     more, a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia cannot\n     justify or excuse the Defendant\u2019s conduct. Nonetheless,\n     this Court assigns this mitigating circumstance little\n     weight.\n\n     In sentencing Noetzel to death, the trial court further found\n\n\u201cthat the aggravating factors clearly, convincingly, and beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d\n\n     Noetzel now appeals.\n\n                              ANALYSIS\n\n     In this direct appeal, we address three issues. Noetzel briefed\n\ntwo issues in which he challenges\u2014on several grounds related to\n\nhis competency and the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s Faretta\n\ninquiry\u2014the trial court\u2019s rulings allowing him to waive counsel and\n\nrepresent himself. Noetzel\u2019s first issue centers on the trial court\u2019s\n\nhandling of his statement during the Faretta inquiry that he had\n\nbeen prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for depression and chronic back\n\npain that he was not taking \u201cat this moment.\u201d Noetzel\u2019s second\n\nissue concerns the trial court\u2019s acceptance, as nonstatutory\n\nmitigation, of his self-disclosure, made during the PSI, that he had\n\n\n\n                                 - 25 -\n\fbeen diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at an unspecified point\n\nin his past, before an expert found him competent to proceed and\n\nbefore the trial court found him competent. As the third issue, we\n\nconduct a mandatory review of Noetzel\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n      (1) Competency and the Right to Self-Representation\n\n     Noetzel first argues that the trial court erred in granting his\n\nrequest for self-representation because it failed to adequately\n\ninquire into his mental-health status, including by ordering a\n\ncompetency evaluation, before allowing him to represent himself.\n\nHe further claims that the trial court failed to \u201cmake[] a\n\ndetermination of record\u201d that he \u201cdoes not suffer from severe mental\n\nillness to the point where [he] is not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself\u201d within the meaning of Florida Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 3.111(d)(3).6\n\n\n\n\n     6. Noetzel also argues that the trial court failed to find that\nhis counsel waiver was \u201cintelligent.\u201d However, as the State correctly\nargues, the trial court made this finding in its sentencing order,\nruling as follows: \u201c[A] very lengthy and thorough Faretta inquiry was\nconducted pursuant to the Defendant\u2019s right and decision to\nrepresent himself. After it was determined that the Defendant\nknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, he was\npermitted to represent himself.\u201d\n\n                                - 26 -\n\f      We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a request for self-\n\nrepresentation for abuse of discretion, Knight v.

The\n\nfirst is the standard for competence to stand trial\u2014i.e., whether the\n\ndefendant has \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer\n\nwith a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and has \u201ca\n\nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against\n\nhim.\u201d Dusky v.

The Dusky standard is the same\n\nstandard of competence required to plead guilty or to waive the\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 27 -\n\fright to assistance of counsel. Godinez v.

Competency\n\n     Noetzel first argues that his disclosure during the Faretta\n\ninquiry that he had been prescribed a \u201cpsych med\u201d for depression\n\nand chronic back pain that he was not taking \u201cat this moment\u201d\n\nshould have resulted in further inquiry from the trial court.\n\nSpecifically, he contends that the trial court should have ordered a\n\ncompetency evaluation and withheld its ruling on his request for\n\nself-representation pending the results. However, because a\n\ncompetency hearing was not required under the facts of Noetzel\u2019s\n\ncase, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n     A criminal defendant has the right to not be proceeded against\n\nwhile mentally incompetent to stand trial, Pate v. Robinson, 383\n\n\n                                 - 29 -\n\fU.S. 375, 378 (1966), and the requirement to inquire as to the\n\ndefendant\u2019s competency is triggered as follows:\n\n     If, at any material stage of a criminal proceeding, the\n     court of its own motion, or on motion of counsel for the\n     defendant or for the state, has reasonable ground to\n     believe that the defendant is not mentally competent to\n     proceed, the court shall immediately enter its order\n     setting a time for a hearing to determine the defendant\u2019s\n     mental condition . . . .\n\nFla.

To the contrary, Noetzel\n\nadmitted that he understood it was completely inadvisable to\n\nrepresent himself but explained that he wanted to do so to further\n\nhis strategy to quickly plead guilty because he was guilty and to\n\n\u201cstreamline\u201d the sentencing phase of the proceeding as much as\n\npossible. 7 Noetzel\u2019s disclosure of a mental illness does not preclude\n\nhim from waiving the right to counsel and proceeding pro se. Cf.\n\nWoodbury, 320 So. 3d at 647-48 (\u201cGiven that certain people with\n\nbipolar disorder function well and act rationally, we see no logic in\n\n\n\n\n      7. When the trial court questioned Noetzel as to why he\nwanted to waive a penalty-phase jury, Noetzel explained his\nstrategy, in part, as follows:\n\n           Why mess somebody else\u2019s life up? I\u2019ve already said\n     I\u2019m guilty. Every investigator that I\u2019ve sat in front of, I\u2019ve\n     walked them through step by step how I killed [Eastwood]\n     and the reasons that I wanted to kill that officer. Plain\n     and simple, walked them step by step. I have not\n     wavered from what I\u2019ve done.\n           There\u2019s no sense in bringing a jury involved and\n     messing up their lives, having to spend money to pay\n     people to come in her and uproot their lives when I can\n     just sit here with you and we can streamline this and be\n     done with it.\n\n                                 - 36 -\n\fcreating a per se rule or presumption that all individuals with\n\nbipolar disorder suffer so severely from mental illness that they are\n\nunable to carry out basic trial tasks without assistance.\u201d).\n\n     Because competent, substantial evidence supports the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s finding that Noetzel\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was\n\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent under Faretta, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in granting Noetzel\u2019s request for self-\n\nrepresentation.\n\n     C.

We disagree.\n\n     Although the technical skill of a criminal defendant to\n\nrepresent himself is not part of the Faretta inquiry, \u201cthe\n\ngovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the\n\ntrial at times outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in acting as his\n\nown lawyer.\u201d Edwards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145786\"><a href=\"/opinion/145786/indiana-v-edwards/\">554 U.S. at 177</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quoting Martinez v.

Rule 3.111(d)(3) thus authorizes trial courts to force counsel\n\nupon a competent criminal defendant who has waived the right to\n\ncounsel and seeks to represent himself at trial in the limited\n\ninstance where the defendant \u201csuffer[s] from severe mental illness\n\nto the point where [he] is not competent to conduct trial\n\nproceedings by himself.\u201d\n\n     As an initial matter, the parties disagree as to whether rule\n\n3.111(d)(3) applies to a case like Noetzel\u2019s\u2014where the defendant\n\npleads guilty rather than proceed to trial but represents himself,\n\nwith standby counsel, during the penalty phase. However, we need\n\nnot resolve the open question of whether what happened in\n\n\n                                - 38 -\n\fNoetzel\u2019s case amounts to a defendant \u201cconduct[ing] trial\n\nproceedings by himself,\u201d within the meaning of rule 3.111(d). That\n\nis because, even if the rule applies to Noetzel\u2019s case, our precedent\n\nclearly establishes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby not forcing counsel upon Noetzel under the rule.\n\n     In Woodbury, 320 So. 3d at 647-48, after reviewing the record,\n\nwe rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his \u201cpurportedly erratic,\u201d\n\nid. at 648, \u201cbehavior in court, together with his bipolar diagnosis,\n\nrequired the trial court to find that [he] suffered from severe mental\n\nillness to the point of being incompetent to conduct the proceedings\n\nby himself,\u201d id. at 647. Under Woodbury, Noetzel\u2019s case is not even\n\nclose, as there is no \u201cpurportedly erratic\u201d behavior. Indeed, there is\n\nnothing in the record to indicate that Noetzel\u2019s mental illness\n\nmanifested in a way that would have precluded him from\n\nconducting trial proceedings by himself within the meaning of rule\n\n3.111(d)(3). To the contrary, the record shows that Noetzel filed\n\nvarious pro se motions, including a motion to compel a ruling on\n\nhis request for self-representation, and addressed them with the\n\ntrial court. During the bench penalty-phase proceeding, Noetzel\n\ncross-examined witnesses, objected to one of the State\u2019s exhibits,\n\n\n                                 - 39 -\n\fintroduced his competency evaluation into evidence, and made a\n\nstatement to the court that aligned with his previously explained\n\nstrategies of pleading guilty because he was guilty and of\n\nstreamlining the penalty-phase proceedings as much as possible.\n\nDuring all of the proceedings, Noetzel\u2019s interactions with the trial\n\ncourt were appropriate; he had no trouble following what was\n\nhappening or carrying out his previously articulated strategies.\n\nMoreover, before proceeding with the bench penalty phase, the trial\n\ncourt did, in fact, rule that Noetzel was \u201ccompetent to proceed and\n\nthere\u2019s no indication of any sort of mental infirmity or defect that\n\nwould prevent [him] from doing so.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports that finding. 8\n\n\n\n\n     8. Noetzel faults the trial court for limiting the competency\nevaluation that it ordered in an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d to his\ncompetency to proceed\u2014as opposed to also ordering evaluation of\nwhether he suffers from severe mental illness to the point he is not\ncompetent to conduct trial proceedings by himself within the\nmeaning of rule 3.111(d)(3). However, the Florida Statutes and this\nCourt\u2019s procedural rules governing the appointment of experts to\nevaluate competency address mental competence to proceed and\nrequire experts to detail specific findings regarding the defendant\u2019s\nmental capacity\u2014findings that were made by the expert in this\ncase. See \u00a7 916.12, Fla. Stat. (2020); Fla R. Crim. P. 3.211-3.212.\nThese provisions do not require additional findings from appointed\nexperts regarding the \u201csomewhat higher\u201d \u201ccompetency standard to\n\n                                 - 40 -\n\f     Accordingly, even assuming that rule 3.111(d)(3) applies, the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to find that Noetzel\n\nsuffered from severe mental illness to the point of being\n\nincompetent to conduct the penalty-phase proceedings by himself.\n\n              (2) Noetzel\u2019s Disclosure During the PSI\n\n     In his second issue, Noetzel argues that even if the trial court\n\ndid not initially err by granting his request for self-representation, it\n\nerred by continuing to allow him to represent himself at the final\n\npenalty-phase hearing that occurred on March 13, 2020, following\n\nthe PSI. More specifically, Noetzel claims that because the trial\n\ncourt accepted, as nonstatutory mitigation, his self-disclosure\n\nduring the PSI that he had been diagnosed with paranoid\n\nschizophrenia at an unspecified point in his past, the trial court\n\nwas required to conduct a new Faretta inquiry and revisit the issue\n\nof competency before accepting Noetzel\u2019s rejection of the renewed\n\noffer of counsel. These arguments were not preserved below, and\n\nwe hold that Noetzel has failed to establish an abuse of discretion\n\nby the trial court, let alone fundamental error.\n\n\n\nconduct trial proceedings without assistance.\u201d Woodbury, 320 So.\n3d at 646.\n\n                                 - 41 -\n\f     First, with respect to competency, the self-disclosure pertained\n\nto a diagnosis that occurred at some unspecified point in Noetzel\u2019s\n\npast, but before the trial court\u2019s interactions with Noetzel, before the\n\nexpert evaluated Noetzel and found him competent to proceed, and\n\nbefore the trial court\u2019s competency findings. The trial court\u2019s\n\nsubsequent acceptance of mitigation in the form of a past diagnosis\n\ndoes not change the competency calculus because mitigation\n\npertains to \u201cfactors in the defendant\u2019s background that would\n\nmitigate against imposition of the death penalty,\u201d \u00a7 921.141(7)(h),\n\nFla.

And, again, as\n\naddressed under issue 1, there are no manifestations of mental\n\nillness or other behavior anywhere in the record that give rise to a\n\nbona fide doubt as to Noetzel\u2019s competence\u2014either to stand trial or,\n\nassuming rule 3.111(d)(3) applies, to conduct trial proceedings by\n\nhimself.

WOJCIK, Judge\n                HONORABLE J. ANDREW CROMPTON, Judge\n\nOPINION BY\nJUDGE COHN JUBELIRER                                 FILED: November 10, 2021\n\n\n      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections - SCI Chester\n(Employer) petitions for review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s\n(Board) January 26, 2021 Order that affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge\u2019s\n(WCJ) September 24, 2019 Decision granting Crystal Faison\u2019s (Claimant) Claim\nPetition. The WCJ found that Claimant had proven that she suffered a work-related\npsychological injury as a result of being sexually assaulted while in the course of\nemployment and that Claimant was entitled to ongoing temporary total disability\nbenefits as of August 10, 2018. On appeal, Employer argues that:1 (1) the WCJ\nerred in denying its Motion to Dismiss the Claim Petition and granting the Claim\nPetition because the WCJ lacked the authority to determine that Claimant was\nraped/sexually assaulted and, therefore, violated the alleged perpetrator\u2019s due\n\n      1\n          We have reorganized the issues raised for ease of discussion.\n\fprocess rights in doing so; (2) the WCJ and the Board erred in not requiring\ncorroborating evidence to prove that Claimant suffered an abnormal working\ncondition; (3) the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and not based on\nsubstantial evidence; and (4) the WCJ committed reversible error by finding\ntestimony that was not submitted in this matter to be reliable and relying on this\ntestimony in its decision. After careful review, we affirm the Board\u2019s Order.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n      A.       The Claim Petition\n      Claimant worked for Employer as a corrections officer. (WCJ\u2019s Decision,\nFinding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 4(a).)2 Claimant filed the Claim Petition alleging that, \u201cas\na result of being sexually assaulted by a co-worker [(Coworker),]\u201d Claimant\ndeveloped a psychological injury. (Claim Petition at 2; FOF \u00b6 1.) The Claim\nPetition sought partial disability benefits starting May 20, 2018, the date of the work-\nrelated incident, and total disability benefits starting August 10, 2018, the date\nClaimant began taking sick leave due to the work-related injury. (Claim Petition at\n2; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4(k).) Employer denied Claimant\u2019s allegations. (FOF \u00b6 2.) Employer\nfiled two Motions to Dismiss, challenging the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction or authority over\nthis matter, which the WCJ denied. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 17a.)\n\n\n      B.       Claimant\u2019s Evidence\n      In support of the Claim Petition, Claimant testified before the WCJ and\nsubmitted Claimant\u2019s prior deposition and the deposition of Justin Wiley, Psy.D., a\nlicensed clinical psychologist. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.)\n\n\n      2\n          The WCJ\u2019s Decision is found at pages 20a through 35a of the Reproduced Record.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f              1.       Claimant\u2019s Testimony\n       In Claimant\u2019s deposition, Claimant testified as follows.3 Claimant began\nworking at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Chester as a corrections officer in April\n2007. (Id. \u00b6 4(a), (b).) Prior to the May 20, 2018 incident, Claimant worked in\nCorridor B of the institution, which is the main corridor connecting the housing units\nin tower A to the Restricted Housing Unit (RHU). (Id.) During the incident on May\n20, 2018, Claimant was in the RHU\u2019s control bubble, which \u201cis an area where there\nare monitors and controls to open the doors and sliders in the actual unit.\u201d (Id.\n\u00b6 4(c).) Claimant had entered the RHU\u2019s control bubble to leave food in the\nrefrigerator. (Id.) When Claimant went to do so, Coworker approached Claimant\nfrom behind, kissed Claimant\u2019s ear, and began trying to undo the belt to Claimant\u2019s\nuniform pants. (Id.) \u201cDuring this time[,] Claimant was trying to push [Coworker]\noff, but [Coworker] was persistent.\u201d (Id.) Coworker then engaged in penetrative\nsexual intercourse with Claimant, while Claimant told Coworker no, that she \u201cdid\nnot want to[,] and [for Coworker] to stop.\u201d (Id.) The incident lasted between five\nand seven minutes, and Claimant continued working afterwards and finished that\nshift. (Id. \u00b6 4(d).)\n       Claimant had known Coworker for about two years prior to the May 20, 2018\nincident, and they had a prior sexual relationship in June 2017. (Id. \u00b6 4(g).) As of\n2018, \u201cClaimant considered their relationship a friendship more than a romance.\u201d\n(Id.) On May 12, 2018, eight days before the incident, Claimant texted Coworker,\nand the conversation \u201cwas friendly in nature.\u201d (Id.; see R.R. at 213a-14a.) Coworker\nthen texted Claimant on May 16, 2018, implying that Coworker wanted to have sex\nwith Claimant. (FOF \u00b6 4(g).) \u201cClaimant had previously discussed with [Coworker]\n\n       3\n         Claimant\u2019s September 17, 2018 deposition testimony is found at pages 113a through 211a\nof the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 4.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat she did not want to have sex[,]\u201d and Claimant again told Coworker the same\nover text. (Id.; R.R. at 215a-17a.)\n        Claimant texted Coworker the day after the incident concerning what\noccurred. (FOF \u00b6 4(h); R.R. at 221a-22a.) Specifically, Claimant stated, \u201cYou\nfinally got what you were requesting lol [(laugh out loud).]\u201d (R.R. at 222a.) After\nCoworker did not respond, Claimant again texted Coworker on May 23, 2018,4\nwriting that Claimant\u2019s appetite has been affected and that she could not ignore what\nhappened. (FOF \u00b6 4(h).) Following the May 20, 2018 incident \u201cClaimant was\nscared and did not know what to expect or how to take the situation.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(e).)\nClaimant \u201cfelt hurt and started to have crying spells and melt[]downs at the office.\u201d\n(Id.)\n        After another coworker (Officer) asked what was wrong because Claimant\nappeared upset, Claimant decided to discuss the incident with Officer. (Id. \u00b6 4(i).)\nAfter Claimant explained what occurred, Officer informed Claimant that Coworker\n\u201cwas married to someone with whom they work[,]\u201d of which Claimant was unaware.\n(Id.) Officer also opined that Claimant had been raped. (Id.) Upon learning the\ntruth about Coworker\u2019s marriage, Claimant decided to text Coworker again, stating,\n\u201cnow that I know the truth, I should have put up more resistance. But you would\nnot take no for an answer.\u201d (R.R. at 225a.) Claimant felt \u201cused and violated.\u201d (FOF\n\u00b6 4(h); R.R. at 225a.)\n        Claimant reported the incident to Employer on June 6, 2018. (FOF \u00b6 4(f).)\nAfter Claimant spoke with two superiors, the two accompanied Claimant to the\nPennsylvania State Police (State Police) Barracks. (Id.) \u201cWhen Claimant initially\nwent to the State Police, she did not want to pursue criminal charges because she\n\n        4\n        The WCJ stated the date as May 22, 2018, in the Findings of Fact, but the Reproduced\nRecord shows that Claimant sent these texts on May 23, 2018. (See R.R. at 222a-24a.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwas afraid of retaliation.\u201d (Id.) On June 11, 2018, Claimant was also interviewed\nby the Director of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office for Employer\n(EEO Director), as a part of an EEO investigation regarding the incident. (Id. \u00b6\n4(o).)\n         Claimant began seeing Dr. Wiley on July 17, 2018. (Id. \u00b6 4(j).) Before the\nincident, Claimant \u201chad never seen a mental health professional or taken anti-\ndepressants or anti-anxiety medicine.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(b).) At the time of Claimant\u2019s\ndeposition, Claimant was treating with Dr. Wiley once per week and was also\nplanning to see a psychiatrist at Dr. Wiley\u2019s recommendation. (Id. \u00b6 4(j); R.R. at\n209a-10a.) Though Claimant had continued working after the incident, Claimant\nhad been \u201czoning out, was crying easily[,] and was irritable.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 4(j).) Further,\nClaimant \u201ccrie[d] more than normal[,]\u201d \u201cha[d] a hard time getting to sleep[,]\u201d \u201cha[d]\nflash[]backs and nightmares[,]\u201d \u201cha[d] [] began to suffer from anxiety attacks[,]\u201d\nand began becoming overwhelmed very easily. (Id. \u00b6 4(k), (s).) Claimant also\n\u201cbegan to isolate[,] lost weight[,]\u201d and began smoking more cigarettes. (Id. \u00b6 4(k).)\nWhile Claimant had been working a regular schedule as best as possible after the\nincident, Claimant decided to take sick leave starting August 10, 2018. (Id.)\n         On August 18, 2018, police went to Claimant\u2019s home after her \u201csister had\ncalled the police concerned that Claimant was suicidal.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(j).) Claimant had\nsent a text to her mother indicating an intent for self-harm, had been drinking alcohol\n\u201cin an attempt to numb her feelings and go to sleep[,]\u201d and \u201chad also taken some\nover[-]the[-]counter sleeping pills.\u201d (Id.) Police brought Claimant to the emergency\nroom and then transported Claimant to a crisis center, where she stayed from August\n19, 2018, through August 20, 2018. (Id.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f         On cross-examination, Claimant admitted to the prior sexual relationship with\nCoworker and Claimant\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding Coworker\u2019s marriage. (Id.\n\u00b6 4(m).) As to the incident itself, Claimant admitted that Coworker was not \u201cviolent\u201d\nbut explained that Coworker \u201cbent [Claimant] over the chair\u201d and \u201cput [Coworker\u2019s]\nweight on Claimant\u201d such that \u201cClaimant was unable to move forward or side to\nside.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(n)-(o).) Claimant discussed a statement written by a State Police\nTrooper (Trooper) following an interview on June 6, 2018, the day that Claimant\nreported the incident. (Id. \u00b6 4(p).) In that statement, \u201cClaimant responded [\u2018]no[\u2019]\nto being assaulted or raped by [Coworker]. Claimant was penetrated but [] did not\nwant to use the term \u2018rape or assault.\u2019\u201d (Id.) However, Claimant made clear that\nshe did not give Coworker permission to engage in sexual intercourse. (Id. \u00b6 4(t).)\n         At the hearing before the WCJ,5 Claimant stated that she attempted to press\ncharges and returned to the State Police to speak with Trooper, but Trooper refused\nto take her statement or reopen the investigation. (Id. \u00b6 5(c).) As to Claimant\u2019s\ninjury and conditions, Claimant explained that she: continues to treat with Dr. Wiley\nand is taking a generic anti-depressant; is \u201canxious and overwhelmed by having to\nrehash the details of the assault\u201d; \u201cstill has visions of the incident and night sweats\u201d;\nand continues to suffer from \u201canxiety and depression\u201d but is \u201ctrying to handle it as\nbest as she can.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 5(a)-(b).) Though \u201ctrying to utilize her children and family\nas support[,] there [we]re moments when [Claimant] just fe[lt] hopeless.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\n5(b).)\n\n\n\n\n         Claimant\u2019s testimony before the WCJ at the February 4, 2019 hearing is found at pages\n         5\n\n83a through 96a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding\nof Fact 5.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f              2.     Dr. Wiley\u2019s Testimony\n       Dr. Wiley testified by deposition as follows.6 Dr. Wiley first examined\nClaimant on July 17, 2018. (Id. \u00b6 6(a).) Dr. Wiley took a history from Claimant\nregarding the May 20, 2018 incident and the resulting symptoms that Claimant was\nexperiencing. (Id.) Dr. Wiley explained that \u201cClaimant was in a lot of distress and\nre-experiencing symptoms associated with trauma. There were symptoms common\nto post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d (Id.) Claimant \u201calso had symptoms associated\nwith hyper-arousal[,] such as panic and anxiety.\u201d (Id.) Claimant \u201chad insomnia,\n[feelings of] hopelessness, depressed mood[,] and appetite disturbance[,]\u201d as well as\n\u201csadness, pessimism[,] and anhedonia[,] which is a lack of pleasure in previously\npleasurable things.\u201d (Id.) Additionally, \u201cClaimant was self-critical, cried a lot[,]\nand had the feeling [of] being punished.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley conducted \u201ca mental status\nexamination\u201d and \u201ca Beck depression inventory,\u201d and \u201cClaimant scored on the\nsevere range on the depression inventory.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley also performed the \u201cBeck\nHopelessness Scale, which revealed Claimant to have a lot of despair and\nhopelessness around the future.\u201d (Id.) Finally, Dr. Wiley \u201cadministered the Brief\nSymptom Inventory[,] which incorporates all the other scales and tests\u201d and \u201cis\nhelpful in the consistency in making a diagnosis.\u201d (Id.) Given the evaluation, tests,\nand Claimant\u2019s history, Dr. Wiley \u201cdiagnosed Claimant with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and major depression[.]\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley opined that \u201c[t]he single episode\ncausing the major depression disorder was\u201d the May 20, 2018 incident. (Id.)\n       Dr. Wiley also reviewed the investigative reports from the State Police.\n(Id. \u00b6 6(c).) Dr. Wiley explained that Claimant \u201cwas under considerable stress and\ndiscussed significant fear of retaliation from\u201d Coworker and \u201cthat it was common\n\n       6\n         Dr. Wiley\u2019s November 13, 2018 deposition testimony is found at pages 240a through\n310a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 6.\n\n\n                                            7\n\famong rape victims to show reluctance or waffling. It does not mean that the rape\ndid not occur.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley also reviewed the report from Brian Bora, M.D.,\nEmployer\u2019s expert, who conducted a psychiatric examination of Claimant. (Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 6(c), 7(a).) Dr. Wiley agreed that Claimant did not display \u201cany indications that\nClaimant was malingering or feigning symptoms.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 6(c).)\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Wiley admitted that \u201cClaimant had not seen any\nother physician or counselor for the\u201d May 20, 2018 incident. (Id. \u00b6 6(e).) Dr. Wiley\nalso admitted that it was not until after the September 4, 2018 examination of\nClaimant that Dr. Wiley first stated that Claimant was unable to work. (Id.) Finally,\nDr. Wiley testified \u201cthat Claimant ha[d] been indecisive about whether or not\n[Claimant] wanted to press charges.\u201d (Id.)\n\n       C.     Employer\u2019s Evidence\n       Employer submitted the deposition testimonies of Dr. Bora, Trooper, and\nEEO Director.7\n              1.      Dr. Bora\u2019s Testimony\n       Dr. Bora testified8 that he \u201cconducted a psychiatric examination of Claimant\non October 9, 2018[,]\u201d which involved taking a history from Claimant about the May\n20, 2018 incident and reviewing various records. (Id. \u00b6 7(a).) Dr. Bora testified that,\nwhile Claimant told Dr. Bora that she did not have any psychiatric history, \u201cthere\n\n       7\n         Employer also submitted the depositions of a lieutenant (Lieutenant) and major (Major)\nfor Employer, who are both in Claimant\u2019s chain of command. The testimonies are not relevant to\nthe present determination. The WCJ found that Lieutenant\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot credible or\npersuasive to defeat Claimant\u2019s allegation of rape by [Coworker]\u201d and that, while Major was\n\u201cgenerally credible,\u201d Major\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot determinative to any issue with regard to\nClaimant\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation claim[]\u201d and was, therefore, rejected. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\nEmployer has not challenged the WCJ\u2019s determinations with respect to these witnesses.\n       8\n         Dr. Bora\u2019s January 22, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 628a through 684a of\nthe Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 7.\n\n\n                                               8\n\fwere family medicine notes from December 2016[] where [Claimant] did report to\nher family physician that she had depressive symptoms.\u201d (R.R. at 648a.) Based on\nthe records and the examination, \u201cDr. Bora opined that it was not clear . . . that\nClaimant had been raped.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 7(b).) Relying on Claimant\u2019s usage of \u201clol\u201d in\nthe text messages to Coworker and their prior sexual relationship, Dr. Bora \u201copined\nthat the situation was complicated . . . and there appeared to be an ongoing flirtation.\u201d\n(Id.) Dr. Bora asserted that \u201cClaimant\u2019s perception changed . . . when [Claimant]\nfound out that [Coworker] was married.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Bora also concluded from a\nDecember 7, 2016 report in which Claimant described feeling depressed to\nClaimant\u2019s family doctor \u201cto mean that Claimant did have a history of depression[.]\u201d\n(Id.) Accordingly, \u201cDr. Bora opined that Claimant did not sustain any work[-]related\ninjury.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 7(c).) While Dr. Bora recognized that \u201cClaimant reported depressive\nsymptoms after the\u201d May 20, 2018 incident, \u201cDr. Bora opined that it is most likely\ndue to\u201d Claimant being unemployed, Claimant\u2019s failed marriage, Claimant\u2019s co-\nworkers being cold to Claimant, and the difficulty of the surrounding situation. (Id.)\nDr. Bora maintained that \u201c[a]ny type of issues that Claimant currently has are not\nrelated to any incident at work.\u201d (Id.)\n      Dr. Bora also made the following admissions:               Dr. Bora \u201cha[d] not\ninterviewed sexual assault victims outside of his private practice[,] but some of his\npatients have been sexually assaulted\u201d; Dr. Bora \u201cdoes not draw conclusions within\nthe context of a treatment plan as to whether or not the sexual assault took place\u201d\nwhen treating patients in his private practice; and Dr. Bora \u201cdid not find Claimant to\nlack any credibility\u201d or \u201cfind any evidence of symptom magnification o[r] symptom\nfabrication[.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 7(d).) Dr. Bora also agreed that Claimant met all six criteria\nfor a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder but stated that, given \u201cthe text\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fmessages and the witness statement\u201d to the State Police, \u201cit was not clear that a rape\ndid occur.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Bora concluded that Claimant did not meet the criteria for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder \u201cbecause she continued to work\u201d after the May 20, 2018\nincident. (Id.)\n\n              2.     Trooper\u2019s Testimony\n       Trooper testified as follows.9 When Claimant went to the State Police with\ntwo superiors in June 2018, Trooper interviewed Claimant regarding the May 20,\n2018 incident. Claimant explained to Trooper \u201cthat she did not want anything done\nbut needed to tell her side of the story.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(b).) Trooper\u2019s interview with\nClaimant was video recorded. (Id.) \u201cClaimant was upset and crying but was willing\nto talk to\u201d Trooper, who listened to Claimant\u2019s recollection of the incident and took\nnotes. (Id.) \u201cWhen asked if Claimant would be able to write down [a] statement,\u201d\nClaimant said she would not. (Id.) Instead, Trooper \u201ccomposed questions for\nClaimant which required one[-]word answers.\u201d (Id.) Trooper then wrote out\npossible answers to those questions, \u201cgave Claimant an opportunity to disagree with\nthe statements[,]\u201d and had Claimant initial the answer with which Claimant agreed.\n(Id.) \u201cIn response to a question during this deposition as to whether or not Claimant\nsaid she was raped or sexually assaulted by [Coworker], Trooper responded that\nClaimant denied this.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(c).) Trooper also asked whether Claimant was more\nupset about finding out that Coworker was married, and Claimant answered in the\naffirmative. (Id.)\n       Trooper testified that there was an attempt to interview Coworker, but\nCoworker refused. (Id. \u00b6 8(d).) Based on Claimant\u2019s interview, Trooper opined that\n\n       9\n        Trooper\u2019s January 17, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 546a through 609a of\nthe Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 8.\n\n\n                                             10\n\f\u201cit appeared that [Claimant] was not sexually assaulted or raped.\u201d (Id.) Trooper\nbelieved that Claimant\u2019s statement that she did not want to get Coworker in trouble\nand Claimant\u2019s responses to Trooper\u2019s written questions and answers agreeing that\nClaimant had not been raped or sexually assaulted supported this position. (Id.)\nAccordingly, Trooper decided to terminate the investigation. (Id.)\n       On cross-examination, Trooper admitted that Claimant stated that she \u201cpushed\n[Coworker] away but not as much as she should have.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(f).) Further, Trooper\nstated he \u201cd[id] not know what a leading question is[]\u201d and admitted to not having\nreceived any \u201ctraining from a psychologist or mental health professional[]\u201d with\nregard to ascertaining \u201cthe state of mind of a sexual assault victim.\u201d (Id.) Trooper\n\u201cdid not find Claimant credible[] but rather thought she was upset about having a\nsexual affair\u201d with a married individual. (Id.) With regard to the specific questions\nasked of Claimant, Trooper \u201cagreed that the video showed that Claimant, when\nasked if she was sexually assaulted, responded by saying that she did not know\nwhether it was safe to say that.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(g).)\n\n\n              3.     EEO Director\u2019s Testimony\n       EEO Director testified as follows.10 EEO Director \u201cis tasked with overseeing\ndiscrimination complaints[,] training for diversity and sexual harassment[,]\u201d and\n\u201csexual harassment investigations.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(a).) EEO Director investigated\nClaimant\u2019s rape allegation, which \u201cconsisted of witness interviews, surveillance\nvideo review of Claimant\u2019s police interview, [and] review of text messages and\npolice reports.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(b).) In forming conclusions in the investigation, EEO\nDirector mostly relied on Claimant\u2019s agreement with Trooper\u2019s written answer that\n\n       10\n          EEO Director\u2019s January 10, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 456a through\n518a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 11.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fClaimant had not been sexually assaulted and Claimant\u2019s text message to Coworker\nin which Claimant used the term \u201clol.\u201d (Id.) EEO Director \u201cfelt this was strong\nevidence because Claimant\u201d first alleged having been raped \u201cbut then immediately\ntook it back\u201d during the interview with Trooper. (Id.) EEO Director also took a\nstatement from Officer, which \u201cconfirm[ed] that the first time Claimant learned that\n[Coworker] was married was during the course of [the] conversation with [Officer]\nwhere [Claimant] confided in [Officer] that [Claimant] did not have consensual\nintercourse with [Coworker].\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(e).) During EEO Director\u2019s interview with\nClaimant, Claimant \u201cconfirmed that Claimant was at first in denial that this was a\nsexual assault.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(f).) As to why Claimant denied that it was so to Trooper,\nClaimant stated that she \u201cfeared retaliation and was terrified.\u201d (Id.) During the\ninterview with Claimant, EEO Director explained that Claimant stated that she \u201ctold\n[Coworker] numerous times that she did not want to have sex with [Coworker].\u201d\n(Id. \u00b6 11(d).) EEO Director \u201ccould not reach any conclusions as to whether any\nconsensual sex occurred.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(f).)\n\n      D.    The WCJ\u2019s Decision\n      The WCJ reviewed the evidence and testimony submitted by the parties and\nmade factual findings and credibility determinations. First, the WCJ reviewed the\ntext messages between Claimant and Coworker. (Id. \u00b6 12; see R.R. at 213a-25a.)\nBased on the review, the WCJ found that \u201c[i]t is not possible to accurately ascribe\nsentiment or emotion to texts\u201d and \u201cthat the texts document that Claimant refused\n[Coworker\u2019s] advancements and overtures to have sex prior\u201d to the May 20, 2018\nincident. (Id. \u00b6 12.) Further, the WCJ found that these text messages showed that,\nafter the incident, \u201cClaimant confronted [Coworker]\u201d and explained that Claimant\nwas affected by the incident and that Claimant \u201ccould not ignore what had\n\n\n                                           12\n\fhappened.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ found that \u201c[t]hese texts [confronting Coworker] were\nsent before Claimant was told that [Coworker] was married.\u201d (Id.)\n      The WCJ also reviewed the videotape of Trooper\u2019s interview of Claimant.\n(Id. \u00b6 13.) The WCJ found that \u201ca review of the videotape in its entirety leaves no\nquestion that Claimant was the victim of a rape at work on May 20, 2018.\u201d (Id.)\nThe WCJ described that, during the interview with Trooper, Claimant is \u201cclearly[,]\nvisibly upset and cries uncontrollably at times when Trooper leaves the room.\u201d (Id.)\n\u201cAlthough Trooper [] encourages Claimant that this incident was more of a\nconsensual intercourse,\u201d the WCJ found that \u201cthe record is devoid of consent.\u201d (Id.)\nThe WCJ found \u201cit significant that Claimant was too upset to write a statement.\u201d\n(Id.) Further, the WCJ found Trooper\u2019s written question and answer approach did\nnot amount to \u201ca statement [by Claimant] but a series of questions which\npredetermine the answer in a yes or no fashion.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ characterized\nTrooper\u2019s approach as using \u201conly leading questions which when answered deny a\nrape.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ found Trooper\u2019s tactics \u201cmake it seem[] that Claimant only\ngot upset when she learned that [Coworker] was married[,]\u201d but \u201c[t]he videotape\ndocuments Claimant\u2019s lack of comfort with being compelled to answer yes or no and\nher hesitation in giving the answers.\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ concluded that\n\u201c[t]he videotape supports Claimant\u2019s testimony that she was raped at work on May\n20, 201[8].\u201d (Id.)\n      Turning to credibility determinations, the WCJ determined Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony was credible and persuasive. (Id. \u00b6 14.) The WCJ explained \u201cClaimant\u2019s\ncomposure and demeanor during [] live testimony and [the WCJ\u2019s] observation of\nthe videotape interview\u201d with Trooper to be significant in making this credibility\ndetermination. (Id.) The WCJ found that Claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent in\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthat Claimant \u201cnever gave her consent to be penetrated by\u201d Coworker, told\nCoworker no, and rebuffed Coworker\u2019s advancements before the incident. (Id.)\nFurther, the WCJ noted that Claimant \u201cnever had any difficulty performing her job\nduties\u201d and \u201cnever sought any mental health treatment or experienced any mental\nhealth illness prior to\u201d the incident. (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ accepted Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony as fact. (Id.)\n      Regarding Dr. Wiley\u2019s and Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found \u201cthat the\ntestimony of Dr. Wiley was more credible and persuasive than the testimony of Dr.\nBora.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 15.) The WCJ explained that \u201cDr. Wiley\u2019s testimony is more credible\nbecause it is consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony[,] which has been\naccepted as fact. As Claimant\u2019s treating psychologist, [Dr. Wiley] was more familiar\nwith the rape, Claimant\u2019s report of the rape, her treatment and her devolution into a\ncrisis in August of 2018.\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ accepted Dr. Wiley\u2019s\ntestimony in its entirety as fact. (Id.)\n      Conversely, the WCJ deemed Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony to be \u201cnot credible or\npersuasive because [Dr. Bora] believed Claimant to have mental health issues in the\npast because of one note in her family doctor\u2019s records from December 7, 2016,\u201d\ndespite the fact that \u201c[t]here is no other indication that Claimant sought mental health\ntreatment or had a mental health illness.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 16.) Further, the WCJ noted that\nDr. Bora believed that Claimant was not raped \u201cbecause[,] in [Dr. Bora\u2019s] opinion,\nClaimant flirted with\u201d Coworker and also because Claimant \u201chad a prior sexual\nrelationship with\u201d Coworker. (Id.) With respect to Claimant\u2019s perception changing\nafter discovering that Coworker was married, the WCJ found that Dr. Bora\n\u201ccompletely misstates the timeline of Claimant\u2019s distress over her rape which was\nimmediate.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ explained Dr. Bora\u2019s misunderstanding of the timeline,\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fas \u201cClaimant only found out [Coworker] was married after Officer asked why\nClaimant was sad\u201d and Claimant told Officer about the incident. (Id. (emphasis\nadded).) Finally, the WCJ found that Dr. Bora \u201clacks credibility because he admits\nthat if Claimant were a private patient, he would not question whether or not she had\nbeen sexually assaulted but would focus on treatment[,] assuming the history to be\ntrue.\u201d (Id.) Finding Dr. Bora\u2019s opinions to be \u201cbiased and without competent factual\nfoundation,\u201d the WCJ rejected Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony in its entirety. (Id.)\n      As for Trooper\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found that \u201cTrooper [] testified\naccurately as to how he conducted the interview with Claimant[]\u201d but did \u201cnot find\n[Trooper\u2019s] conclusions that the assault on Claimant was consensual sexual\nintercourse credible or persuasive.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 18.) Finding that Claimant never\nconsented but specifically said \u201cno,\u201d the WCJ added that the facts that Claimant\n\u201cadmits she froze\u201d and that she \u201cshould have fought [Coworker] off more . . . do not\nmake the forced intercourse consensual.\u201d (Id.) As for Trooper\u2019s interview with\nClaimant, the WCJ found the questions to be leading in nature because \u201call of the\nquestions he wrote for Claimant that p[ur]port to be \u2018her\u2019 statement[] presuppose an\nanswer compelling a conclusion that the sex was consensual, and [that] Claimant\nwas upset\u201d because she discovered that Coworker was married. (Id.) The WCJ\nexplained that Trooper\u2019s \u201creasoning does not support that the rape did not occur[]\u201d\nand that Trooper\u2019s reliance on a lack of \u201cviolence\u201d is in error where there was no\nconsent. (Id.)\n      Turning to EEO Director\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found the testimony not\ncredible or persuasive. The WCJ noted that EEO Director \u201crelied heavily on the\ninterview of Claimant by Trooper [] and the text messages.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 21.) Given that\nthe WCJ \u201chas found both not credible to defeat Claimant\u2019s\u201d competent and\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fpersuasive testimony concerning the incident, the WCJ determined that EEO\nDirector\u2019s \u201cinvestigation and testimony [were] not based on a competent factual\nfoundation and [] rejected\u201d them. (Id.)\n       Finally, despite that Officer did not provide testimony in this matter, the WCJ\nstated that she found Officer\u2019s testimony consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony and\naccepted it as fact. (Id. \u00b6 17.) Further, in discussing Claimant\u2019s credibility, the WCJ\nfound that \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony is also supported by the testimony of Officer[].\u201d\n(Id. \u00b6 14.)\n       Accordingly, the WCJ found that \u201c[o]n May 20, 2018, Claimant was raped in\nthe control bubble of the [RHU] by [Coworker.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 22.) The WCJ explained\nthat the burden of proof in this \u201cmental/mental case\u201d requires \u201cproof of an abnormal\nworking condition\u201d and found that \u201c[f]orced sexual intercourse without consent is a\nrape[]\u201d and that \u201c[r]ape is never a normal working condition.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 23.) The WCJ\nfound that the incident caused Claimant to sustain a psychological injury in the form\nof post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, and that this injury was \u201cnot\na subjective reaction to a normal working condition[]\u201d but has been \u201cobjectively\nverified by Dr. Wiley.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; WCJ\u2019s Conclusions of Law (COL) \u00b6 2.) As\na result, the WCJ concluded, \u201cClaimant became totally disabled effective August 10,\n2018.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 25; COL \u00b6 3.) Employer appealed the WCJ\u2019s Decision to the Board.\n\n       E.       The Board\u2019s Opinion11\n       On appeal to the Board, Employer argued that:                  (1) \u201cthe WCJ lacked\njurisdiction to decide whether Claimant was raped and[,] in doing so[,] violated the\ncriminal due process rights of [Coworker]\u201d; (2) the WCJ\u2019s Decision was not\nsupported by substantial, competent evidence; (3) the WCJ capriciously disregarded\n\n       11\n            The Board\u2019s Opinion is found at pages 47a through 60a of the Reproduced Record.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fevidence; and (4) the WCJ \u201cerroneously found Claimant\u2019s testimony was\ncorroborated by Officer[.]\u201d (Board Opinion (Op.) at 2.)\n      First, the Board concluded that Claimant satisfied the \u201cburden of proving by\nobjective evidence that [Claimant] sustained a psych[ological] injury and that such\ninjury was other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions.\u201d (Id. at\n11.) The Board explained that Claimant provided proof that she suffered from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder through her \u201ccredited\ntestimony as to an actual event and the credited testimony of her treating\npsychologist[,] Dr. Wiley.\u201d (Id.) Because \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony was not limited to\n[a] belief of subjective, abnormal conditions[] but rather included [Claimant\u2019s own]\ndescription . . . of an actual, specific event[,]\u201d the question of credibility was solely\nfor the WCJ to make within her discretion. (Id.) Given that the WCJ found that\n\u201cClaimant was physically assaulted causing her to sustain a psychological injury[,]\u201d\nthe Board determined that the credited testimonies of Claimant and Dr. Wiley\n\u201cconstitute[d] substantial, competent evidence [that] Claimant sustained work-\nrelated\u201d injuries rendering Claimant \u201ctotally disabled ongoing from August 10,\n2018.\u201d (Id.) The Board added that the fact that \u201cClaimant provided a signed\nstatement to the . . . State Police denying rape or sexual assault does not diminish\nthe substantial, competent evidence supporting the WCJ\u2019s Decision.\u201d (Id.) Because\nClaimant\u2019s testimony regarding the event was found credible, and given that the\nmedical evidence from Dr. Wiley \u201cunequivocally established that the abnormal\nworking conditions caused psych[ological] injuries,\u201d the Board concluded that \u201cthe\nWCJ did not err in finding a compensable injury.\u201d (Id. at 12.)\n      Turning to Employer\u2019s contention that \u201cthe WCJ\u2019s finding that Claimant was\nphysically assaulted or made reference to the word \u2018rape\u2019 is [] tantamount to a\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fcriminal conviction[,]\u201d the Board explained that while \u201ca determination as to\nwhether the crimes of sexual assault or rape occurred were outside [the WCJ\u2019s]\nspecific jurisdiction, the WCJ was well within her purview to determine whether\nClaimant was subjected to abnormal working conditions[.]\u201d (Id. (emphasis added).)\nThe Board stated that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act12 (Act) \u201cis applicable to all\ninjuries occurring within Pennsylvania[.]\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the Board explained,\n\u201c[a] WCJ may analyze evidence concerning incidents on the job leading to disability,\neven if that evidence implicates criminal conduct[,]\u201d comparing the WCJ\u2019s finding\nhere to those in Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Workers\u2019 Compensation\nAppeal Board (Kochanowicz), 108 A.3d 922 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014); Miller v. Workers\u2019\nCompensation Appeal Board (New Wilmington Family Practice), 724 A.2d 971 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1999); and Archer v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (General\nMotors and Royal Insurance Co.), 587 A.2d 901 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1991). (Board\u2019s Op.\nat 12.)     \u201cThat the same set of facts can lead to litigation in other legal or\nadministrative arenas with their own burdens of proof and procedural rules[,]\u201d the\nBoard held, \u201cis not a usurpation of those arenas.\u201d (Id. at 12-13.) The Board further\nemphasized that its \u201caffirmance of the WCJ\u2019s findings of an abnormal working\ncondition based on substantial, competent evidence does not relate to or overlap with\nthe determination of whether a criminal act did or did not occur.\u201d (Id. at 13 n.3.)\n      The Board then addressed Employer\u2019s position that August 10, 2018, was not\nthe proper date of disability because Dr. Wiley did not document that Claimant\nshould not be working until September 4, 2018. The Board explained that \u201cthe\nrecord indicates that August 10, 2018[,] was the date Claimant ceased working due\nto her ongoing symptoms of depression and anxiety.\u201d (Id.) \u201cBecause the WCJ\n\n\n      12\n           Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.4, 2501-2710.\n\n\n                                               18\n\fcredited Claimant\u2019s testimony in that regard, [the Board] decline[d] to disturb that\ndate on appeal[]\u201d as those \u201ccredibility determinations were not made arbitrarily and\ncapriciously and [the WCJ\u2019s] findings are supported by substantial evidence[.]\u201d (Id.\n(citations omitted).)\n       Finally, the Board turned to Employer\u2019s argument that \u201cthe WCJ erred by\nfinding Claimant\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Officer as that testimony is absent\nfrom the record.\u201d (Id.) Agreeing that Officer\u2019s testimony was not in the record, the\nBoard nonetheless concluded that the WCJ\u2019s error in so stating was \u201charmless as this\nabsent testimony was explicitly found to be consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony,\nwhich is part of the record and was found credible.\u201d (Id. at 13-14 (citing Benson v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Haverford State Hosp.), 668 A.2d 244, 248-49 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1995)).) Accordingly, the Board affirmed the WCJ\u2019s Decision.13 Employer\nnow petitions for review.14\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.  Whether the WCJ had authority to find that the May 20, 2018 incident\n           occurred as Claimant testified.\n              1.     Parties\u2019 Arguments\n       Employer argues that the WCJ erred in denying its Motion to Dismiss the\nClaim Petition and granting the Claim Petition because the WCJ lacked the authority\nto determine that the May 20, 2018 work incident occurred and that, in doing so,\nacted outside of the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Employer posits that the General Assembly\n\u201cvested the power to prosecute criminal matters in the Attorney General\u201d and district\n\n       13\n         Two of the Board\u2019s Commissioners concurred in the result only.\n       14\n          Our scope of review in workers\u2019 compensation matters \u201cis limited to determining\nwhether constitutional rights have been violated, whether an error of law has been committed[,]\nand whether all necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Archer, 587\nA.2d at 903.\n\n\n                                              19\n\fattorneys and that the statute vesting such authority \u201cis unambiguous and should be\nread as a restriction on any other party acting to investigate criminal offenses\u201d under\nthe plain meaning of the statute\u2019s language. (Employer\u2019s Brief (Br.) at 31 (citing\nSection 206 of the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-206).15) Because\nthe Act does not give a WCJ any authority to investigate or determine whether a\ncrime was committed and only confers prosecution powers to district attorneys for\npurposes of insurance fraud, Employer asserts, the WCJ was without authority to\ndetermine that Coworker raped Claimant. (Id. at 32.) Employer posits that the Board\n\u201cadmit[ted] that the WCJ made a determination that a criminal act did occur \u2013\nsomething that [it] also admit[ted] is outside [the WCJ\u2019s or Board\u2019s] jurisdiction.\u201d\n(Id. at 33.)\n       Additionally, Employer argues that the WCJ violated Coworker\u2019s due process\nrights by determining that Coworker had raped Claimant. Given that Coworker \u201cdid\nnot have the ability to confront his accuser[,]\u201d and \u201cdid not have the opportunity to\nbe heard, since any statements [Coworker] ma[de] could be used against [Coworker]\nin the future[,]\u201d Employer contends that \u201cCoworker was tried and administratively\ndetermined to be a rapist in absentia.\u201d (Id. at 35.) Further, recognizing that\nCoworker \u201cdoes not face criminal prosecution or confinement as a result of the\nWCJ\u2019s Decision,\u201d Employer posits that Coworker does face \u201cvery real private and\npublic scorn and humiliation by the WCJ\u2019s finding that [Coworker] raped Claimant.\u201d\n(Id. at 35-36.) Employer argues that \u201c[t]his violation of [Coworker\u2019s] due process\nrights is akin to vigilante justice wherein [Coworker] has been branded a rapist by\nsomeone not authorized or capable to do so, and this branding shall remain in\n[Coworker\u2019s] file for the remainder of [Coworker\u2019s] career.\u201d (Id. at 36.)\n\n\n       15\n            Act of October 15, 1980, P.L. 950, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 732-101 \u2013 732-506.\n\n\n                                               20\n\f       Claimant responds, arguing that the WCJ acted within her jurisdiction.\nClaimant asserts that a WCJ is \u201cempowered to find that an incident or circumstances\non the job, if it rises to the level of abnormal working conditions, can cause\npsychological injuries.\u201d (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 12 (citing Martin v. Ketchum, 568 A.2d\n159 (Pa. 1990)).) Claimant asserts that \u201cwork-related injuries are [often] caused by\nconduct that entails potential criminal actions\u201d and compares this case to that in\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board\n(Cantarella), 835 A.2d 860 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003), where the claimant, an instructor at\na state prison, was touched inappropriately by an inmate and later developed anxiety\nand post-traumatic stress disorder. (Id. at 12-13.) Claimant argues \u201cthat the finding\nof fact . . . does not amount to a conviction; rather, the finding of fact was simply a\nrecognition that the incident was work-related, abnormal, and caused disabling\npsychological conditions,\u201d which Claimant maintains is within the WCJ\u2019s authority.\n(Id. at 13.)\n       Claimant argues that \u201c[t]he same set of facts can lead to litigation in\u201d the\n\u201cspheres\u201d of criminal, civil, and administrative law, \u201ceach with their own separate\nburdens of proof and procedural rules.\u201d (Id. at 14.) Claimant further contends that\nEmployer\u2019s \u201cattempt to analogize this to the [insurance] fraud provision of the Act\n. . . is likewise meritless.\u201d (Id. at 15.) Claimant cites Section 1110 of the Act, 77\nP.S. \u00a7 1039.10,16 which states that \u201c[n]othing contained in this article shall be\nconstrued to limit the regulatory or investigative authority of any department or\nagency of the Commonwealth[,]\u201d as support that \u201ca WCJ may consider and rule upon\nallegations of fraudulent conduct arising in an active workers\u2019 compensation\nmatter.\u201d (Id. (quoting 77 P.S. \u00a7 1039.10) (internal citations omitted).) Finally,\n\n\n       16\n            Section 1110 was added by Section 20 of the Act of July 2, 1993, P.L. 190.\n\n\n                                                21\n\fClaimant argues that Employer\u2019s \u201cassertions that [] due process[17] or Confrontation\nClause[18] principles are implicated here are no less ridiculous than its position that a\nWCJ may not adjudicate matters involving criminal activity or conduct by an\nindividual.\u201d (Id. at 16.)\n       In its Reply Brief, Employer asserts that Claimant provided no authority for\nthe assertion that work-related injuries often stem from potentially criminal conduct.\nFurther, Employer argues that this Court in Cantarella rejected that the claimant had\nbeen subjected to abnormal working conditions and also any \u201cper se\u201d rule that any\nspecific conduct automatically qualifies as an abnormal working condition.\n(Employer\u2019s Reply Br. at 1-2.) Further, Employer argues that \u201cClaimant and the\nWCJ want to be able to call someone a rapist and determine that a rape occurred[]\nbut then claim it has no meaning or impact outside the workers\u2019 compensation\n\n\n\n       17\n          Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in\nrelevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law[.]\u201d U.S. CONST. amend.

Analysis\n      For the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation matters, the Act \u201cappl[ies] to all\ninjuries occurring within this Commonwealth[.]\u201d Section 101 of the Act, 77 P.S.\n\u00a7 1. To provide compensation to injured workers, \u201ca WCJ and the Board are\nauthorized by the Act to determine whether or not an employee who alleges [the\nemployee] was injured during the course of [their] employment is entitled to\ncompensation.\u201d Heath v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole),\n860 A.2d 25, 30 (Pa. 2004). In doing so, a WCJ is required to make credibility and\nevidentiary determinations, to make findings as to the facts underlying the matter,\nand to determine whether a claimant has met the burden of proving entitlement to\ncompensation, and with regard to these findings and determinations, \u201cthe WCJ is the\nultimate finder of fact and the exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary\nweight.\u201d Thompson v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (USF&G Co.), 781 A.2d 1146,\n1150 (Pa. 2001).\n      It is well settled that work-related psychological injuries are compensable\nunder Section 301(c)(1) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1). Archer, 587 A.2d at 313. Our\nSupreme Court has explained that a claimant\u2019s burden of proof to recover benefits\nfor a psychological injury is twofold, requiring the claimant first to \u201cprove by\nobjective evidence that [the claimant] has suffered a psych[ological] injury and[,\nsecond,] that such injury is other than a subjective reaction to normal working\nconditions.\u201d Davis v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Swarthmore Borough), 751 A.2d\n168, 174 (Pa. 2000) (citing Martin, 568 A.2d at 159). \u201cEven if a claimant shows\nactual, not merely perceived or imagined, employment events that have precipitated\n\n\n                                         23\n\f[a] psych[ological] injury, the claimant must still prove the events to be abnormal in\norder to recover.\u201d Id. (citing Wilson v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Aluminum\nCo. of Am.), 669 A.2d 338 (Pa. 1996)). Further, given the fact-intensive nature of\npsychological injury cases, \u201cin determining whether actual working conditions are\nabnormal, they must be considered in the context of the specific employment.\u201d U.S.\nAirways v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Long), 756 A.2d 96, 101 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2000).\n      Here, Employer argues that the WCJ lacked authority to determine that\nClaimant had been raped or sexually assaulted by Coworker and that, in doing so,\nthe WCJ violated Coworker\u2019s due process rights. We disagree. The Act extends to\n\u201call injuries occurring within this Commonwealth[,]\u201d including those where the\nevidence implicates criminal conduct. 77 P.S. \u00a7 1.\n      Contrary to Employer\u2019s arguments, courts have found abnormal working\nconditions and granted benefits in other instances where the evidence implicated\ncriminal conduct. For instance, in RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v.\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Hopton), 912 A.2d 1278 (Pa. 2007), the\nclaimant alleged to have been the victim of sexual harassment by the claimant\u2019s\nsupervisor. In holding that the harassment constituted abnormal working conditions\nwhere the supervisor harassed the claimant intensely and with high frequency, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court also noted that the supervisor\u2019s conduct \u201carguably\nconstitute[d] criminal harassment.\u201d Id. at 1288. There was no indication that this\nlimited the WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction to decide whether the injury occurred and\nwas compensable.\n      Similarly, in Kochanowicz, the claimant alleged to have been the victim of an\narmed robbery while working at the employer\u2019s retail store. The claimant averred\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fthat the robbery caused him post-traumatic stress disorder. After considering that\nthe claimant had received workplace training for such an incident, we nonetheless\nupheld the WCJ\u2019s finding that the robbery constituted abnormal working conditions\ngiven that the claimant had not experienced workplace violence in his 30-year\nemployment. Kochanowicz, 108 A.3d at 934. Again, there was no impediment to\nthe WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction. Likewise, in Philadelphia Electric Co. v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Miller), 643 A.2d 1186 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n1994), the claimant, a meter reader, alleged to have been chased by a dog while\nworking. The claimant further averred that the dog\u2019s owner then threatened to kill\nthe claimant and proceeded to then chase the claimant with a gun. We determined\nthat this conduct constituted an abnormal working condition that caused the claimant\npsychological injuries.\n      Finally, in Donovan v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Academy\nMedical Realty), 739 A.2d 1156 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999), the claimant alleged an injury\nduring employment as a janitor in a medical office resulting from exposure and\nwounding by hypodermic needles that were improperly disposed of. We held that\nthis constituted an abnormal working condition, especially because improper\ndisposal of infectious waste carried both civil and criminal penalties. Id. at 1163.\n      In these cases, the evidence implicated criminal conduct resulting in the\nclaimants\u2019 injuries by actors who were not parties in the proceeding. Nonetheless,\nthe WCJs and the Board were within their purview to determine that a compensable\ninjury resulted from conduct that occurred in the course of the claimants\u2019\nemployment. These cases demonstrate that although the evidence may implicate\ncriminal conduct, this does not limit the WCJ\u2019s or the Board\u2019s authority and\njurisdiction to determine that a compensable, work-related injury occurred.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      While Employer argues that \u201cthe Act does not give a WCJ jurisdiction over\ncriminal matters to make findings of criminal wrongdoing and to [grant or] suspend\nbenefits based thereon[,]\u201d that is not what occurred. See, e.g., Brehm v. Workers\u2019\nComp. Appeal Bd. (Hygienic Sanitation Co.), 782 A.2d 1077, 1087 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2001) (Friedman, J., dissenting). As the Board astutely stated:\n\n      We emphasize that our affirmance of the WCJ\u2019s finding of an abnormal\n      working condition based on substantial, competent evidence does not\n      relate to or overlap with the determination of whether a criminal act did\n      or did not occur . . . . We acknowledge that the authority to prosecute\n      the crimes of sexual assault and rape rests with the criminal justice\n      system alone, which applies differing procedural rules and burdens of\n      proof.\n\n(Board\u2019s Op. at 13 n.3.) The WCJ\u2019s findings in this case did not constitute a legal\ndetermination that Coworker criminally raped or sexually assaulted Claimant. As\nEmployer recognizes, there has been no criminal process in this matter, and\nCoworker \u201chere does not face criminal prosecution or confinement[.]\u201d (Employer\u2019s\nBr. at 35.) This was an administrative proceeding, and the WCJ did not apply the\nelements of the statutory provisions criminalizing rape and sexual assault or the very\nhigh standard of proof employed in criminal matters.\n      Here, the WCJ made credibility determinations, and found there was\nsubstantial evidence that Claimant was subjected to nonconsensual sexual\nintercourse at work, that this was an abnormal working condition, and that she\nsustained a resulting psychological injury which was not a subjective reaction to a\nnormal working condition. This was within the WCJ\u2019s authority. That the WCJ also\nopined that such conduct amounted to rape does not render the WCJ\u2019s findings in\nerror or diminish the WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction. As the Board recognized, \u201ca\ndetermination of whether a criminal act did or did not occur\u201d was outside of the\n\n                                         26\n\fBoard\u2019s or the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction. (Employer\u2019s Br. at 33 (citing Board Op. at 13\nn.3).) The Board correctly emphasized that the WCJ\u2019s findings of fact in these\nmatters do not amount to a determination as to any criminal liability stemming from\nthe conduct at issue. (See Board\u2019s Op. at 13 n.3.)\n      Because Coworker is not a party, this is not a criminal proceeding, and there\nis no risk of an adverse adjudication as to Coworker, we also disagree that the WCJ\u2019s\nDecision implicates Coworker\u2019s due process rights or the Confrontation Clause.\nEmployer cites no authority to support such a proposition.            Indeed, that the\nConfrontation Clause concerns the rights of criminal defendants \u201c[i]n . . . criminal\nprosecutions[]\u201d belies that position. U.S. CONST. amend. VI.\n      Finally, we note that adopting Employer\u2019s position would be contrary to the\npurpose of the Act, which ensures that injured employees have a process available\nto seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Such a decision would render heinous\nconduct in the workplace that causes injury to go unchecked and would prevent\nemployees injured on the job by such conduct from seeking compensation and\nredress of injury. This is especially true in light of the fact that the Act \u201creplace[d]\ntraditional common law rights and remedies[]\u201d in regard to an employee\u2019s recovery\nfor work-related injury against an employer. East v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd.\n(USX Corp./Clairton), 828 A.2d 1016, 1021 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003). Thus, we agree\nwith Claimant that any potential criminal liability for conduct that is at issue in a\nworkers\u2019 compensation matter does not negate a WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction and authority.\nAccordingly, the WCJ and the Board did not err on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      B.       Whether the Board erred in holding that corroboration was not\n               necessary to prove that an abnormal working condition occurred.\n               1.       Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer argues that the WCJ and the Board erred in holding that \u201cit is not\nnecessary to determine if an actual rape or sexual assault occurred because all\nClaimant had to do was demonstrate abnormal working conditions and an \u2018actual\nevent\u2019 that caused [Claimant\u2019s] alleged injuries.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 39.) Employer\nmaintains that \u201ccorroboration was necessary[]\u201d to show that the \u201csexual act . . . [was]\nunwanted\u201d and that the Board erred in not so requiring. (Id. at 40.) Employer likens\nthe WCJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s determinations to \u201csupport the idea that a claimant can\nallege that aliens came down and injured her at work\u201d and that \u201conly [the] claimant\u2019s\ntestimony that it happened would be required to sustain a compensable claim.\u201d (Id.\nat 41-42.)\n      In response, Claimant argues that corroborative evidence was not required in\nthis matter.        Claimant maintains that, in certain circumstances, corroborative\nevidence is not required to prove that an event constituting an abnormal working\ncondition occurred. (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 20 (citing Archer, 587 A.2d at 901).)\nClaimant asserts that \u201c[c]orroborative evidence is required to support the claimant\u2019s\ndescription of a general abnormal working environment that caused an injury;\nhowever, where a claimant testifies about actual events, corroborative evidence is\nnot required.\u201d (Id. at 18 (citing Donovan, 739 A.2d at 1156).) Because Claimant\nestablished that Claimant sustained work-related injuries as a result of an actual,\ndescribed event, Claimant maintains that the WCJ and the Board did not err.\n\n               2.       Analysis\n      As explained above, the claimant in workers\u2019 compensation matters alleging\na mental/mental injury carries the burden of proving that her injury was not a\n\n                                             28\n\fsubjective reaction to normal working conditions.         Normally, \u201ca claimant\u2019s\ntestimony of abnormal working conditions must be corroborated.\u201d            Reigle v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Fed. Exp.), 601 A.2d 1331, 1334 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1992)\n(citing Russella v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Nat\u2019l Foam Sys. Inc.), 497 A.2d\n290 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1985)). However, this Court created an exception to this general\nrule in Archer. There, the claimant alleged that harassment by the claimant\u2019s\nsupervisor caused the claimant psychological injury. The Board denied benefits,\nconcluding that the claimant was required to corroborate the allegation of\nmistreatment. We reversed, explaining that \u201c[t]he testimony of the claimant in this\ncase was not limited to her belief that she felt she was being harassed; she also\ndescribed actual events[.]\u201d    Archer, 587 A.2d at 907 (emphasis in original).\nAccordingly, we held that \u201c[w]hile objective evidence may well be necessary where\nan employee is describing subjective feelings, no such evidence is necessary where\nactual events are being described.\u201d Id. This Court explained that a contrary holding\nthat \u201crequire[d] such evidence would allow an employer to mistreat its employees\nwith impunity as long as such conduct was done in private.\u201d Id. at 906.\n      We addressed this exception again in Philadelphia Electric Co. There, the\nemployer argued that our holding in Archer was limited to harassment and\nmistreatment by an employer on its premises and was not extended to other\ncircumstances. We disagreed, explaining that \u201cArcher and its progeny contain no\nadmonition that these cases be limited in this manner.\u201d Phila. Elec. Co., 643 A.2d\nat 1189. Because the claimant there testified to actual, specific events with respect\nto being attacked by a dog and threatened with a gun by the dog\u2019s owner, testimony\nthat the WCJ found credible, we held that corroboration was not required. Id.; see,\ne.g., Donovan, 739 A.2d at 1163 (holding that the claimant\u2019s testimony of being\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\finjured by improperly disposed hypodermic needles did not require corroboration\nbecause the claimant was describing actual events); Monessen, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s\nComp. Appeal Board (Marsh), 631 A.2d 1119 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1993) (claimant who\ndescribed being nearly run over by an oiling wheel of a coke oven door did not need\nto present corroborative evidence of this event where the WCJ finds that such event\noccurred).\n      In the present case, Employer maintains that Claimant was required to present\ncorroborating evidence that the sexual intercourse was nonconsensual. We disagree.\nHere, Claimant testified that the sexual intercourse was nonconsensual, that\nClaimant told Coworker no, and that Coworker forced Claimant to engage in the\nintercourse using the force of Coworker\u2019s body weight. (FOF \u00b6 4(c), (n).) The WCJ\nfound Claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible and persuasive in light of \u201c[C]laimant\u2019s\ncomposure and demeanor during [Claimant\u2019s] live testimony[.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 14.) Similar\nto the claimant in Philadelphia Electric Co. who did not need to corroborate the\nallegations of harassment and mistreatment because the testimony related to an event\nand the WCJ found the testimony credible, 643 A.2d at 1189, Claimant here testified\nto actual, perceived events, not just Claimant\u2019s subjective reaction to normal\nworking conditions.    Moreover, the WCJ found Claimant\u2019s testimony to be\npersuasive and credible. (FOF \u00b6 14.)\n      Therefore, as determined in Archer, because Claimant was not testifying to\nhow an event made Claimant subjectively feel but describing an actual event,\nClaimant was not required to present corroborating evidence. 587 A.2d at 906-07.\nJust as such a holding in Archer would permit \u201can employer to mistreat its employees\nwith impunity as long as such conduct was done in private[,]\u201d such a decision here\nwould allow an employee to be forced into nonconsensual sexual intercourse in\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fprivate without redress for the psychological injuries. Id. at 906. Accordingly,\nbecause the facts presented in this case fit squarely in the exception under Archer,\nthe Board did not err in concluding that corroboration was not required and affirming\nthe WCJ\u2019s Decision.\n\n      C.   Whether the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and not\n      supported by substantial, competent evidence of record.\n             1.     Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer argues that the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and\nnot based on competent evidence. Employer asserts that the Board \u201cdid not mention\nthe conflicting evidence . . . in this case or the fact that the WCJ did not address the\nconflicting evidence but merely ignored [the] same.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 40.) First,\nEmployer submits that the WCJ erred in finding Dr. Wiley to be more credible than\nDr. Bora, alleging that Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony was contradictory to Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony and further \u201cdemonstrate[d] that Dr. Wiley was a paid puppet being\ndirected in his treatment of Claimant by [Claimant\u2019s attorney.]\u201d (Id. at 43.) Second,\nEmployer posits that the WCJ ignored contradictory evidence as to Claimant\u2019s\nalleged injuries and Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony and opinions. (Id. at 44-45.) Third,\nEmployer asserts that the WCJ misstated Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony with respect to his\nreliance on Coworker\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship. (Id. at 45 n.7.)\n      Finally, Employer asserts that the WCJ erred in ignoring substantial evidence\nthat the sexual intercourse was consensual. In addition to Claimant\u2019s statements to\nthe State Police that Claimant was not raped or sexually assaulted, Employer argues\nthat \u201c[t]he WCJ failed to accord proper weight to the prior sexual relationship\nbetween Claimant and [Coworker], as well as the sexual nature of [C]laimant\u2019s text[\nmessage]s to [Coworker] before and on May 20, 2018.\u201d (Id. at 41.) Moreover,\n\n\n                                          31\n\fEmployer asserts that substantial evidence shows \u201c[C]laimant only became upset\nabout this alleged interaction/incident and alleged that a rape/sexual assault took\nplace once she found out that [Coworker] was married and that she could not pursue\na relationship with [Coworker].\u201d (Id. at 46-47.) Employer maintains that the WCJ\u2019s\nfinding that Claimant was upset immediately after the incident was in error because:\nClaimant continued to work after the incident \u201cwithout any issues\u201d; Claimant did\nnot speak with anyone about the incident on May 20, 2018; Claimant used the term\n\u201clol\u201d when Claimant texted Coworker the following day after the incident; and the\nother text messages from Claimant to Coworker that \u201ctend to show a woman seeking\nout the attention of a man who she had a flirtatious relationship with and who she\nlater discovers is married.\u201d (Id. at 47.) Moreover, Employer asserts that the WCJ\nignored Claimant\u2019s \u201csigned statement\u201d given to the State Police that the incident was\nnot rape or sexual assault and that Claimant was more upset about learning that\nCoworker was married. (Id. at 48-49.) Employer maintains that Claimant only\nalleged that a rape or sexual assault occurred after Officer opined that Claimant had\nbeen raped and, moreover, that the evidence of record does not support that Claimant\nwas sexually assaulted or raped. (Id. at 50.)\n      Claimant responds that the Board properly affirmed the WCJ\u2019s findings\nbecause Claimant proved with objective evidence that Claimant\u2019s psychological\ninjury resulted from abnormal working conditions. Claimant argues that she proved\nthat the abnormal working condition in this case was the \u201cnon-consensual sexual\nintercourse forced upon her by [Coworker],\u201d and that Employer\u2019s arguments \u201care\nlittle more than meritless attacks on the WCJ\u2019s credibility determinations, which are\nwell-reasoned and supported by substantial evidence of record.\u201d (Claimant\u2019s Br. at\n21.) Claimant maintains that the WCJ thoroughly explained the WCJ\u2019s credibility\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fdeterminations and that Employer\u2019s position \u201cattempts to manipulate the evidence\nand overcome a nuanced and clearly well-reasoned and supported decision by the\nWCJ[.]\u201d (Id. at 25.)\n      In its Reply Brief, Employer maintains that the evidence in this matter\n\u201creflects\u201d that: (1) \u201cClaimant clearly lied ([e]ither to [Trooper] or under oath in this\nproceeding)\u201d; (2) \u201cClaimant wanted a relationship with [Coworker]\u201d; (3) \u201cClaimant\nonly became upset when she realized [Coworker] was married\u201d; (4) \u201cClaimant never\nsought treatment until she obtained an attorney\u201d; and (5) \u201cClaimant\u2019s expert was\ntainted.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Reply Br. at 4.)\n\n             2.     Analysis\n      In workers\u2019 compensation cases, it is well settled \u201cthat the WCJ has the\nexclusive authority to make findings of fact and credibility determinations.\u201d Daniels\nv. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Tristate Transp.), 828 A.2d 1043, 1052 (Pa. 2003).\nThus, as stated above, in these matters, \u201c[t]he WCJ is the ultimate finder of fact and\nthe exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary weight.\u201d Thompson, 781 A.2d at\n1150. Our Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[t]he deference generally accorded to\nfact-finders in disputed proceedings is a function of the comparative advantage the\nfact-finder has over any reviewing body in making assessments that may depend,\ninter alia, upon the demeanor of witnesses.\u201d           Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052.\nAccordingly, the WCJ may reject or accept the testimony of any witness. A & J\nBuilders, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Verdi), 78 A.3d 1233, 1238 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 2013).\n      In reviewing the WCJ\u2019s credibility and evidentiary determinations, \u201c[i]t is\nirrelevant whether the record contains evidence to support findings other than those\nmade by the WCJ; the critical inquiry is whether there is evidence to support the\n\n\n                                          33\n\ffindings actually made.\u201d Furnari v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Temple Inland),\n90 A.3d 53, 60 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) (citation omitted). Thus, this Court\u2019s authority\nin these matters is limited to reviewing the entire record to see if it contains evidence\nthat a reasonable person might find sufficient to support the WCJ\u2019s findings. Id. If\nthe record contains such evidence, the findings must be upheld, even though the\nrecord may contain conflicting evidence. Id.\n       A capricious disregard only occurs when the WCJ deliberately ignores\nrelevant, competent evidence. Capasso v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (RACS\nAssocs., Inc.), 851 A.2d 997, 999 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004). Capricious disregard of\nevidence \u201cis a deliberate and baseless disregard of apparently trustworthy evidence.\u201d\nWilliams v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (USX Corp.-Fairless Works), 862 A.2d 137,\n144 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004). Nonetheless, \u201cwhere there is substantial evidence to\nsupport [a WCJ\u2019s] factual findings, and those findings in turn support the\nconclusions, it should remain a rare instance in which an appellate court would\ndisturb an adjudication based upon capricious disregard.\u201d Leon E. Wintermyer, Inc.\nv. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Marlowe), 812 A.2d 478, 487 n.14 (Pa. 2002).\n       Finally, a WCJ\u2019s decision must satisfy the reasoned decision requirements of\nSection 422(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. Section 422(a) provides, in relevant part,\nthat\n\n       [a]ll parties to an adjudicatory proceeding are entitled to a reasoned\n       decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon\n       the evidence as a whole which clearly and concisely states and explains\n       the rationale for the decisions so that all can determine why and how a\n       particular result was reached.\n\n77 P.S. \u00a7 834. To satisfy the reasoned decision requirements, a WCJ must set forth\nthe rationale for the decision by specifying the evidence relied upon and reasons for\n\n\n                                           34\n\faccepting it. Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1047; Dorsey v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd.\n(Crossing Constr. Co.), 893 A.2d 191, 194 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006). In the face of\nconflicting evidence, the WCJ \u201cmust adequately explain the reasons for rejecting or\ndiscrediting competent evidence.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. \u201cSection 422(a) does not require\nthe WCJ to discuss all of the evidence presented[]\u201d but only \u201cto make the findings\nnecessary to resolve the issues raised by the evidence and relevant to the decision.\u201d\nDorsey, 893 A.2d at 194 n.4. \u201c[T]he purpose of a reasoned decision is to spare the\nreviewing court from having to imagine why the WCJ believed one witness over\nanother[]\u201d and to \u201cpermit adequate appellate review.\u201d Id. at 194, 196.\n      In determining credibility, a WCJ may satisfy the reasoned decision\nrequirements by basing a credibility determination on a witness\u2019s demeanor during\nlive testimony. Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052-53. However, \u201c[w]here medical experts\ntestify by deposition, a WCJ\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence must be supported\nby more than a statement that one expert is deemed more credible than another.\u201d\nDorsey, 893 A.2d at 194. The WCJ must articulate an objective basis for credibility\ndeterminations in order to allow for effective appellate review. Id. Nevertheless,\n\u201cSection 422(a) does not permit a party to challenge or second-guess the WCJ\u2019s\nreasons for credibility determinations.\u201d Dorsey, 893 A.2d at 194.\n      Looking to the present case, Employer first argues that the WCJ erred in\ncrediting Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony over that of Dr. Bora. In order to comply with the\nreasoned decision requirements for the purposes of credibility determinations of\nexpert witnesses, the WCJ was required to provide \u201cmore than just a statement that\none expert is deemed more credible than another[]\u201d and to articulate an objective\ncredibility determination to allow for effective appellate review. Id. Here the WCJ\u2019s\ncredibility determination complied with the reasoned decision requirement because\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fit contained more than just a conclusory statement regarding the expert\u2019s credibility.\nThe WCJ explained that Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony was more credible and persuasive\nthan that of Dr. Bora because it was consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony\nand because Dr. Wiley was Claimant\u2019s treating psychologist and was, therefore,\nmore familiar with Claimant\u2019s experiences and symptoms. (FOF \u00b6 15.) The WCJ\nthen explained her rejection of Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony, stating that Dr. Bora\n\u201cmisstate[d] the time[]line of Claimant\u2019s distress\u201d over the incident, determined that\nClaimant had a history of mental illness solely from one note in her family doctor\u2019s\nrecords despite there being no other indication of previous mental illnesses, and\n\u201cadmit[ted] that if Claimant were a private patient, [Dr. Bora] would not question\nwhether or not she had been sexually assaulted but would focus on treatment\nassuming the history to be true.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 16.) Thus, we disagree that the WCJ erred\nin this credibility determination, as the WCJ articulated an objective basis for the\ndetermination. Dorsey, 893 A.2d at 194. Because \u201cSection 422(a) does not permit\na party to challenge or second-guess the WCJ\u2019s reasons for credibility\ndeterminations[,]\u201d id., and given that \u201c[t]he WCJ is the ultimate finder of fact and\nthe exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary weight[,]\u201d Thompson, 781 A.2d\nat 1150, we may not supplant the WCJ\u2019s credibility determinations with our own.\n      Employer next submits that the WCJ ignored contradictory evidence\nregarding inconsistencies between Dr. Wiley\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s testimony and \u201cthe\ncredible testimony of Dr. Bora.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 45.) Our review of the evidence\nsubmitted in this case and the WCJ\u2019s findings show that the WCJ complied with this\ndirective. The WCJ\u2019s findings permitted ample appellate review and do not force\nthis Court to \u201cimagine why the WCJ believed one witness over another[.]\u201d Id. As\nexplained above, the WCJ articulated objective reasons for finding Dr. Wiley\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\ftestimony credible and finding Dr. Bora to be not credible. Moreover, a WCJ need\nnot \u201cdiscuss all of the evidence presented[]\u201d but only \u201cto make the findings necessary\nto resolve the issues raised by the evidence and relevant to the decision.\u201d Dorsey\n893 A.2d at 194 n.4. Because it cannot be said that a reasonable person would not\nfind the evidence of record to support the WCJ\u2019s findings, Furnari, 90 A.3d at 60,\nand because substantial evidence exists to support those findings, Leon E.\nWintermyer, Inc., 812 A.2d at 487 n.14, it is not within this Court\u2019s authority to\ndisturb them.\n      Third, Employer argues that the WCJ mischaracterized Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony\nwith regard to Dr. Bora\u2019s reliance on Coworker and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship.\nThe WCJ found that Dr. Bora\u2019s position was that \u201cbecause . . . Claimant flirted with\u201d\nand \u201chad a prior sexual relationship with\u201d Coworker, Claimant was not raped. (FOF\n\u00b6 16.) Our review of Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony is consistent with this finding. After\nbeing asked whether Dr. Bora \u201cbelieved that some sort of rape or sexual assault\noccurred on May 20[], 2018[,]\u201d Dr. Bora testified: \u201cBased on the records that I\nreviewed, it\u2019s not clear to me that a rape occurred.        [C]laimant was texting\n[Coworker] immediately prior to the incident and after the incident, they had a\nhistory of sexual relations previously[, and i]t appeared they were having an ongoing\nflirtation[.]\u201d (R.R. at 653a.) Given the consistency between this testimony and the\nWCJ\u2019s finding, we disagree that the WCJ mischaracterized Dr. Bora\u2019s reliance on\nCoworker and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship.\n      Employer last argues that the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious\nbecause the WCJ ignored evidence showing that the sexual intercourse was\nconsensual. We disagree. A review of the WCJ\u2019s findings show that the WCJ\ncomplied with the reasoned decision requirements by \u201cadequately explain[ing] the\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\freasons for rejecting or discrediting competent evidence.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. With\nregard to the text messages that Claimant sent to Coworker after the May 20, 2018\nincident that used the term \u201clol,\u201d the WCJ found that it was \u201cnot possible to\naccurately ascribe sentiment or emotion to texts[,]\u201d but that Claimant sent the texts\nto \u201cconfront[ Coworker] by [] telling [Coworker] that she was upset over\u201d the\nincident, that Claimant\u2019s \u201cappetite was affected[,]\u201d \u201cthat she could not ignore what\nhad happened[,]\u201d and that Claimant \u201cfelt used and violated.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 12.) The WCJ\nalso found that \u201c[t]hese texts were sent before Claimant was told that [Coworker]\nwas married.\u201d (Id.) Next, with respect to the \u201csigned statement\u201d that Claimant gave\nto the State Police, the WCJ reviewed the videotape of Claimant\u2019s interview with\nTrooper and Trooper\u2019s testimony and determined that Trooper\u2019s conclusions that\nClaimant consented to the sexual intercourse and his interview and investigation\napproach were not reliable. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18.) The WCJ explained that Trooper\u2019s\ndecision to write questions that \u201cpresuppose an answer compelling a conclusion that\nthe sex was consensual\u201d amounted to a leading approach and that the resulting\ndocument did not constitute Claimant\u2019s \u201cstatement.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 18.) The WCJ also\ndisagreed with Trooper\u2019s opinion that Claimant was only upset because she found\nout that Coworker was married. (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ rejected Trooper\u2019s\nconclusions as to consent as unreliable and also did not credit Claimant\u2019s\n\u201cstatement\u201d due to the leading nature of the questions that Trooper wrote for\nClaimant. Id. These findings show that the WCJ did not \u201cdeliberate[ly] and\nbaseless[ly] disregard . . . apparently trustworthy evidence.\u201d Williams, 862 A.2d at\n144. Rather, the WCJ adequately explained the reasons for rejecting this evidence.\nWhile Employer asks this Court to instead determine that this evidence shows that\nthe sexual intercourse was consensual, such an evidentiary determination is within\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fthe discretion of the WCJ in these matters. Thompson, 781 A.2d at 1150. Because\nthe WCJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and complied with the\nreasoned decision requirements, the WCJ\u2019s findings were not arbitrary or capricious.\n\n      D.    Whether the WCJ\u2019s crediting of Officer\u2019s testimony as reliable and\n      consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony constituted reversible error.\n\n             1.    Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer last argues that the WCJ erred in finding Officer\u2019s testimony to be\ncredible because Officer did not testify in this matter. Because the WCJ found\nOfficer\u2019s testimony to be credible and accepted it as fact, Employer maintains that\nthe WCJ\u2019s credibility determination as to Claimant constituted reversible error, as\nthe WCJ relied in part on the consistency between Officer\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony.\n      Claimant acknowledges that the WCJ\u2019s finding that Officer\u2019s testimony was\ncredible was in error but asserts that this error was harmless because any statements\nalleged to have been made by Officer were merely cumulative of Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony and established through other evidence of record. (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 23.)\n\n\n             2.    Analysis\n      This Court has held that a WCJ\u2019s error is harmless where \u201cother competent\nevidence, standing alone, exists in the record to support the [WCJ\u2019s] findings.\u201d\nNabisco, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Cummings), 651 A.2d 716, 718-19\n(Pa. Cmwlth. 1994). In Nabisco, the WCJ erred by admitting hearsay evidence that\nsupported the finding that the claimant was injured while in the course of\nemployment. We held that the error was harmless because the WCJ also relied on\nthe testimony of other witnesses to support the WCJ\u2019s findings. Id. at 719.\n\n\n                                         39\n\f      Here, the WCJ\u2019s crediting of Officer\u2019s testimony was harmless error. While\nOfficer did not offer any testimony, the WCJ found that \u201c[t]he testimony of Officer\n[] has been reviewed and is found credible and persuasive.[19] [Officer\u2019s] testimony\nis consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony and is accepted as fact.\u201d (FOF\n\u00b6 17.) Further, the WCJ found that \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony is also support[ed] by the\ntestimony of Officer [].\u201d (Id. \u00b6 14.) However, the WCJ did not state what\nevidentiary findings were made based on Officer\u2019s testimony. With regard to using\nOfficer\u2019s testimony to support Claimant\u2019s testimony, the WCJ also relied on\nClaimant\u2019s demeanor during live testimony, Claimant\u2019s deposition testimony, and\nthe videotape interview with Trooper. Such evidence is more than sufficient for a\nWCJ\u2019s credibility determination, given that \u201ca WCJ may satisfy the reasoned\ndecision requirements by basing a credibility determination on a witness\u2019s demeanor\nduring live testimony.\u201d Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052-53. Moreover, there is nothing\nto suggest that the WCJ would not have made the same credibility determination as\nto Claimant without Officer\u2019s \u201ctestimony.\u201d Further, Claimant\u2019s testimony regarding\nthe conversation with Officer is also supported by the testimony of Employer\u2019s own\nwitness, EEO Director. (Id. \u00b6 11(d).) Accordingly, because \u201cother competent\nevidence, standing alone, exists to support the [WCJ\u2019s] findings,\u201d Nabisco Inc., 651\nA.2d at 718-19, any error of the WCJ in this matter was harmless.\n\n   III.    CONCLUSION\n      In sum: (1) the WCJ had the authority and jurisdiction to determine that\nabnormal working conditions caused Claimant\u2019s psychological injuries, regardless\nof whether the evidence implicates criminal conduct; (2) because Claimant credibly\n\n      19\n          After review, it appears that the WCJ misunderstood EEO Director\u2019s notes of the\ninterview with Officer to be Officer\u2019s testimony in this matter.\n\n\n                                           40\n\ftestified to actual events, corroboration was not necessary to prove that the abnormal\nworking conditions existed; (3) the WCJ\u2019s findings were not arbitrary and capricious\nand were supported by substantial evidence of record; and (4) the WCJ\u2019s crediting\nof Officer\u2019s testimony constituted harmless error. Accordingly, we affirm the\nBoard\u2019s Order.\n\n\n\n                                       _____________________________________\n                                       REN\u00c9E COHN JUBELIRER, Judge\n\n\n\n\nJudge Fizzano Cannon did not participate in the decision in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f       IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania,           :\nDepartment of Corrections - SCI         :\nChester,                                :\n                        Petitioner      :\n                                        :\n                  v.                    :   No. 150 C.D. 2021\n                                        :\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal            :\nBoard,                                  :\n                      Respondent        :\n\n\n                                     ORDER\n\n\n      NOW, November 10, 2021, the Order of Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal\nBoard, entered in the above-captioned matter, is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                      _____________________________________\n                                      REN\u00c9E COHN JUBELIRER, Judge\n\f",

ANDREW CROMPTON, Judge\n\nOPINION BY\nJUDGE COHN JUBELIRER                                 FILED: November 10, 2021\n\n\n      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections - SCI Chester\n(Employer) petitions for review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s\n(Board) January 26, 2021 Order that affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge\u2019s\n(WCJ) September 24, 2019 Decision granting Crystal Faison\u2019s (Claimant) Claim\nPetition. The WCJ found that Claimant had proven that she suffered a work-related\npsychological injury as a result of being sexually assaulted while in the course of\nemployment and that Claimant was entitled to ongoing temporary total disability\nbenefits as of August 10, 2018. On appeal, Employer argues that:1 (1) the WCJ\nerred in denying its Motion to Dismiss the Claim Petition and granting the Claim\nPetition because the WCJ lacked the authority to determine that Claimant was\nraped/sexually assaulted and, therefore, violated the alleged perpetrator\u2019s due\n\n      1\n          We have reorganized the issues raised for ease of discussion.\n\fprocess rights in doing so; (2) the WCJ and the Board erred in not requiring\ncorroborating evidence to prove that Claimant suffered an abnormal working\ncondition; (3) the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and not based on\nsubstantial evidence; and (4) the WCJ committed reversible error by finding\ntestimony that was not submitted in this matter to be reliable and relying on this\ntestimony in its decision. After careful review, we affirm the Board\u2019s Order.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n      A.       The Claim Petition\n      Claimant worked for Employer as a corrections officer. (WCJ\u2019s Decision,\nFinding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 4(a).)2 Claimant filed the Claim Petition alleging that, \u201cas\na result of being sexually assaulted by a co-worker [(Coworker),]\u201d Claimant\ndeveloped a psychological injury. (Claim Petition at 2; FOF \u00b6 1.) The Claim\nPetition sought partial disability benefits starting May 20, 2018, the date of the work-\nrelated incident, and total disability benefits starting August 10, 2018, the date\nClaimant began taking sick leave due to the work-related injury. (Claim Petition at\n2; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4(k).) Employer denied Claimant\u2019s allegations. (FOF \u00b6 2.) Employer\nfiled two Motions to Dismiss, challenging the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction or authority over\nthis matter, which the WCJ denied. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 17a.)\n\n\n      B.       Claimant\u2019s Evidence\n      In support of the Claim Petition, Claimant testified before the WCJ and\nsubmitted Claimant\u2019s prior deposition and the deposition of Justin Wiley, Psy.D., a\nlicensed clinical psychologist. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.)\n\n\n      2\n          The WCJ\u2019s Decision is found at pages 20a through 35a of the Reproduced Record.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f              1.       Claimant\u2019s Testimony\n       In Claimant\u2019s deposition, Claimant testified as follows.3 Claimant began\nworking at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Chester as a corrections officer in April\n2007. (Id. \u00b6 4(a), (b).) Prior to the May 20, 2018 incident, Claimant worked in\nCorridor B of the institution, which is the main corridor connecting the housing units\nin tower A to the Restricted Housing Unit (RHU). (Id.) During the incident on May\n20, 2018, Claimant was in the RHU\u2019s control bubble, which \u201cis an area where there\nare monitors and controls to open the doors and sliders in the actual unit.\u201d (Id.\n\u00b6 4(c).) Claimant had entered the RHU\u2019s control bubble to leave food in the\nrefrigerator. (Id.) When Claimant went to do so, Coworker approached Claimant\nfrom behind, kissed Claimant\u2019s ear, and began trying to undo the belt to Claimant\u2019s\nuniform pants. (Id.) \u201cDuring this time[,] Claimant was trying to push [Coworker]\noff, but [Coworker] was persistent.\u201d (Id.) Coworker then engaged in penetrative\nsexual intercourse with Claimant, while Claimant told Coworker no, that she \u201cdid\nnot want to[,] and [for Coworker] to stop.\u201d (Id.) The incident lasted between five\nand seven minutes, and Claimant continued working afterwards and finished that\nshift. (Id. \u00b6 4(d).)\n       Claimant had known Coworker for about two years prior to the May 20, 2018\nincident, and they had a prior sexual relationship in June 2017. (Id. \u00b6 4(g).) As of\n2018, \u201cClaimant considered their relationship a friendship more than a romance.\u201d\n(Id.) On May 12, 2018, eight days before the incident, Claimant texted Coworker,\nand the conversation \u201cwas friendly in nature.\u201d (Id.; see R.R. at 213a-14a.) Coworker\nthen texted Claimant on May 16, 2018, implying that Coworker wanted to have sex\nwith Claimant. (FOF \u00b6 4(g).) \u201cClaimant had previously discussed with [Coworker]\n\n       3\n         Claimant\u2019s September 17, 2018 deposition testimony is found at pages 113a through 211a\nof the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 4.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat she did not want to have sex[,]\u201d and Claimant again told Coworker the same\nover text. (Id.; R.R. at 215a-17a.)\n        Claimant texted Coworker the day after the incident concerning what\noccurred. (FOF \u00b6 4(h); R.R. at 221a-22a.) Specifically, Claimant stated, \u201cYou\nfinally got what you were requesting lol [(laugh out loud).]\u201d (R.R. at 222a.) After\nCoworker did not respond, Claimant again texted Coworker on May 23, 2018,4\nwriting that Claimant\u2019s appetite has been affected and that she could not ignore what\nhappened. (FOF \u00b6 4(h).) Following the May 20, 2018 incident \u201cClaimant was\nscared and did not know what to expect or how to take the situation.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(e).)\nClaimant \u201cfelt hurt and started to have crying spells and melt[]downs at the office.\u201d\n(Id.)\n        After another coworker (Officer) asked what was wrong because Claimant\nappeared upset, Claimant decided to discuss the incident with Officer. (Id. \u00b6 4(i).)\nAfter Claimant explained what occurred, Officer informed Claimant that Coworker\n\u201cwas married to someone with whom they work[,]\u201d of which Claimant was unaware.\n(Id.) Officer also opined that Claimant had been raped. (Id.) Upon learning the\ntruth about Coworker\u2019s marriage, Claimant decided to text Coworker again, stating,\n\u201cnow that I know the truth, I should have put up more resistance. But you would\nnot take no for an answer.\u201d (R.R. at 225a.) Claimant felt \u201cused and violated.\u201d (FOF\n\u00b6 4(h); R.R. at 225a.)\n        Claimant reported the incident to Employer on June 6, 2018. (FOF \u00b6 4(f).)\nAfter Claimant spoke with two superiors, the two accompanied Claimant to the\nPennsylvania State Police (State Police) Barracks. (Id.) \u201cWhen Claimant initially\nwent to the State Police, she did not want to pursue criminal charges because she\n\n        4\n        The WCJ stated the date as May 22, 2018, in the Findings of Fact, but the Reproduced\nRecord shows that Claimant sent these texts on May 23, 2018. (See R.R. at 222a-24a.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwas afraid of retaliation.\u201d (Id.) On June 11, 2018, Claimant was also interviewed\nby the Director of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office for Employer\n(EEO Director), as a part of an EEO investigation regarding the incident. (Id. \u00b6\n4(o).)\n         Claimant began seeing Dr. Wiley on July 17, 2018. (Id. \u00b6 4(j).) Before the\nincident, Claimant \u201chad never seen a mental health professional or taken anti-\ndepressants or anti-anxiety medicine.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(b).) At the time of Claimant\u2019s\ndeposition, Claimant was treating with Dr. Wiley once per week and was also\nplanning to see a psychiatrist at Dr. Wiley\u2019s recommendation. (Id. \u00b6 4(j); R.R. at\n209a-10a.) Though Claimant had continued working after the incident, Claimant\nhad been \u201czoning out, was crying easily[,] and was irritable.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 4(j).) Further,\nClaimant \u201ccrie[d] more than normal[,]\u201d \u201cha[d] a hard time getting to sleep[,]\u201d \u201cha[d]\nflash[]backs and nightmares[,]\u201d \u201cha[d] [] began to suffer from anxiety attacks[,]\u201d\nand began becoming overwhelmed very easily. (Id. \u00b6 4(k), (s).) Claimant also\n\u201cbegan to isolate[,] lost weight[,]\u201d and began smoking more cigarettes. (Id. \u00b6 4(k).)\nWhile Claimant had been working a regular schedule as best as possible after the\nincident, Claimant decided to take sick leave starting August 10, 2018. (Id.)\n         On August 18, 2018, police went to Claimant\u2019s home after her \u201csister had\ncalled the police concerned that Claimant was suicidal.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(j).) Claimant had\nsent a text to her mother indicating an intent for self-harm, had been drinking alcohol\n\u201cin an attempt to numb her feelings and go to sleep[,]\u201d and \u201chad also taken some\nover[-]the[-]counter sleeping pills.\u201d (Id.) Police brought Claimant to the emergency\nroom and then transported Claimant to a crisis center, where she stayed from August\n19, 2018, through August 20, 2018. (Id.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f         On cross-examination, Claimant admitted to the prior sexual relationship with\nCoworker and Claimant\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding Coworker\u2019s marriage. (Id.\n\u00b6 4(m).) As to the incident itself, Claimant admitted that Coworker was not \u201cviolent\u201d\nbut explained that Coworker \u201cbent [Claimant] over the chair\u201d and \u201cput [Coworker\u2019s]\nweight on Claimant\u201d such that \u201cClaimant was unable to move forward or side to\nside.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(n)-(o).) Claimant discussed a statement written by a State Police\nTrooper (Trooper) following an interview on June 6, 2018, the day that Claimant\nreported the incident. (Id. \u00b6 4(p).) In that statement, \u201cClaimant responded [\u2018]no[\u2019]\nto being assaulted or raped by [Coworker]. Claimant was penetrated but [] did not\nwant to use the term \u2018rape or assault.\u2019\u201d (Id.) However, Claimant made clear that\nshe did not give Coworker permission to engage in sexual intercourse. (Id. \u00b6 4(t).)\n         At the hearing before the WCJ,5 Claimant stated that she attempted to press\ncharges and returned to the State Police to speak with Trooper, but Trooper refused\nto take her statement or reopen the investigation. (Id. \u00b6 5(c).) As to Claimant\u2019s\ninjury and conditions, Claimant explained that she: continues to treat with Dr. Wiley\nand is taking a generic anti-depressant; is \u201canxious and overwhelmed by having to\nrehash the details of the assault\u201d; \u201cstill has visions of the incident and night sweats\u201d;\nand continues to suffer from \u201canxiety and depression\u201d but is \u201ctrying to handle it as\nbest as she can.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 5(a)-(b).) Though \u201ctrying to utilize her children and family\nas support[,] there [we]re moments when [Claimant] just fe[lt] hopeless.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\n5(b).)\n\n\n\n\n         Claimant\u2019s testimony before the WCJ at the February 4, 2019 hearing is found at pages\n         5\n\n83a through 96a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding\nof Fact 5.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f              2.     Dr. Wiley\u2019s Testimony\n       Dr. Wiley testified by deposition as follows.6 Dr. Wiley first examined\nClaimant on July 17, 2018. (Id. \u00b6 6(a).) Dr. Wiley took a history from Claimant\nregarding the May 20, 2018 incident and the resulting symptoms that Claimant was\nexperiencing. (Id.) Dr. Wiley explained that \u201cClaimant was in a lot of distress and\nre-experiencing symptoms associated with trauma. There were symptoms common\nto post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d (Id.) Claimant \u201calso had symptoms associated\nwith hyper-arousal[,] such as panic and anxiety.\u201d (Id.) Claimant \u201chad insomnia,\n[feelings of] hopelessness, depressed mood[,] and appetite disturbance[,]\u201d as well as\n\u201csadness, pessimism[,] and anhedonia[,] which is a lack of pleasure in previously\npleasurable things.\u201d (Id.) Additionally, \u201cClaimant was self-critical, cried a lot[,]\nand had the feeling [of] being punished.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley conducted \u201ca mental status\nexamination\u201d and \u201ca Beck depression inventory,\u201d and \u201cClaimant scored on the\nsevere range on the depression inventory.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley also performed the \u201cBeck\nHopelessness Scale, which revealed Claimant to have a lot of despair and\nhopelessness around the future.\u201d (Id.) Finally, Dr. Wiley \u201cadministered the Brief\nSymptom Inventory[,] which incorporates all the other scales and tests\u201d and \u201cis\nhelpful in the consistency in making a diagnosis.\u201d (Id.) Given the evaluation, tests,\nand Claimant\u2019s history, Dr. Wiley \u201cdiagnosed Claimant with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and major depression[.]\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley opined that \u201c[t]he single episode\ncausing the major depression disorder was\u201d the May 20, 2018 incident. (Id.)\n       Dr. Wiley also reviewed the investigative reports from the State Police.\n(Id. \u00b6 6(c).) Dr. Wiley explained that Claimant \u201cwas under considerable stress and\ndiscussed significant fear of retaliation from\u201d Coworker and \u201cthat it was common\n\n       6\n         Dr. Wiley\u2019s November 13, 2018 deposition testimony is found at pages 240a through\n310a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 6.\n\n\n                                            7\n\famong rape victims to show reluctance or waffling. It does not mean that the rape\ndid not occur.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley also reviewed the report from Brian Bora, M.D.,\nEmployer\u2019s expert, who conducted a psychiatric examination of Claimant. (Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 6(c), 7(a).) Dr. Wiley agreed that Claimant did not display \u201cany indications that\nClaimant was malingering or feigning symptoms.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 6(c).)\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Wiley admitted that \u201cClaimant had not seen any\nother physician or counselor for the\u201d May 20, 2018 incident. (Id. \u00b6 6(e).) Dr. Wiley\nalso admitted that it was not until after the September 4, 2018 examination of\nClaimant that Dr. Wiley first stated that Claimant was unable to work. (Id.) Finally,\nDr. Wiley testified \u201cthat Claimant ha[d] been indecisive about whether or not\n[Claimant] wanted to press charges.\u201d (Id.)\n\n       C.     Employer\u2019s Evidence\n       Employer submitted the deposition testimonies of Dr. Bora, Trooper, and\nEEO Director.7\n              1.      Dr. Bora\u2019s Testimony\n       Dr. Bora testified8 that he \u201cconducted a psychiatric examination of Claimant\non October 9, 2018[,]\u201d which involved taking a history from Claimant about the May\n20, 2018 incident and reviewing various records. (Id. \u00b6 7(a).) Dr. Bora testified that,\nwhile Claimant told Dr. Bora that she did not have any psychiatric history, \u201cthere\n\n       7\n         Employer also submitted the depositions of a lieutenant (Lieutenant) and major (Major)\nfor Employer, who are both in Claimant\u2019s chain of command. The testimonies are not relevant to\nthe present determination. The WCJ found that Lieutenant\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot credible or\npersuasive to defeat Claimant\u2019s allegation of rape by [Coworker]\u201d and that, while Major was\n\u201cgenerally credible,\u201d Major\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot determinative to any issue with regard to\nClaimant\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation claim[]\u201d and was, therefore, rejected. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\nEmployer has not challenged the WCJ\u2019s determinations with respect to these witnesses.\n       8\n         Dr. Bora\u2019s January 22, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 628a through 684a of\nthe Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 7.\n\n\n                                               8\n\fwere family medicine notes from December 2016[] where [Claimant] did report to\nher family physician that she had depressive symptoms.\u201d (R.R. at 648a.) Based on\nthe records and the examination, \u201cDr. Bora opined that it was not clear . . . that\nClaimant had been raped.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 7(b).) Relying on Claimant\u2019s usage of \u201clol\u201d in\nthe text messages to Coworker and their prior sexual relationship, Dr. Bora \u201copined\nthat the situation was complicated . . . and there appeared to be an ongoing flirtation.\u201d\n(Id.) Dr. Bora asserted that \u201cClaimant\u2019s perception changed . . . when [Claimant]\nfound out that [Coworker] was married.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Bora also concluded from a\nDecember 7, 2016 report in which Claimant described feeling depressed to\nClaimant\u2019s family doctor \u201cto mean that Claimant did have a history of depression[.]\u201d\n(Id.) Accordingly, \u201cDr. Bora opined that Claimant did not sustain any work[-]related\ninjury.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 7(c).) While Dr. Bora recognized that \u201cClaimant reported depressive\nsymptoms after the\u201d May 20, 2018 incident, \u201cDr. Bora opined that it is most likely\ndue to\u201d Claimant being unemployed, Claimant\u2019s failed marriage, Claimant\u2019s co-\nworkers being cold to Claimant, and the difficulty of the surrounding situation. (Id.)\nDr. Bora maintained that \u201c[a]ny type of issues that Claimant currently has are not\nrelated to any incident at work.\u201d (Id.)\n      Dr. Bora also made the following admissions:               Dr. Bora \u201cha[d] not\ninterviewed sexual assault victims outside of his private practice[,] but some of his\npatients have been sexually assaulted\u201d; Dr. Bora \u201cdoes not draw conclusions within\nthe context of a treatment plan as to whether or not the sexual assault took place\u201d\nwhen treating patients in his private practice; and Dr. Bora \u201cdid not find Claimant to\nlack any credibility\u201d or \u201cfind any evidence of symptom magnification o[r] symptom\nfabrication[.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 7(d).) Dr. Bora also agreed that Claimant met all six criteria\nfor a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder but stated that, given \u201cthe text\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fmessages and the witness statement\u201d to the State Police, \u201cit was not clear that a rape\ndid occur.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Bora concluded that Claimant did not meet the criteria for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder \u201cbecause she continued to work\u201d after the May 20, 2018\nincident. (Id.)\n\n              2.     Trooper\u2019s Testimony\n       Trooper testified as follows.9 When Claimant went to the State Police with\ntwo superiors in June 2018, Trooper interviewed Claimant regarding the May 20,\n2018 incident. Claimant explained to Trooper \u201cthat she did not want anything done\nbut needed to tell her side of the story.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(b).) Trooper\u2019s interview with\nClaimant was video recorded. (Id.) \u201cClaimant was upset and crying but was willing\nto talk to\u201d Trooper, who listened to Claimant\u2019s recollection of the incident and took\nnotes. (Id.) \u201cWhen asked if Claimant would be able to write down [a] statement,\u201d\nClaimant said she would not. (Id.) Instead, Trooper \u201ccomposed questions for\nClaimant which required one[-]word answers.\u201d (Id.) Trooper then wrote out\npossible answers to those questions, \u201cgave Claimant an opportunity to disagree with\nthe statements[,]\u201d and had Claimant initial the answer with which Claimant agreed.\n(Id.) \u201cIn response to a question during this deposition as to whether or not Claimant\nsaid she was raped or sexually assaulted by [Coworker], Trooper responded that\nClaimant denied this.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(c).) Trooper also asked whether Claimant was more\nupset about finding out that Coworker was married, and Claimant answered in the\naffirmative. (Id.)\n       Trooper testified that there was an attempt to interview Coworker, but\nCoworker refused. (Id. \u00b6 8(d).) Based on Claimant\u2019s interview, Trooper opined that\n\n       9\n        Trooper\u2019s January 17, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 546a through 609a of\nthe Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 8.\n\n\n                                             10\n\f\u201cit appeared that [Claimant] was not sexually assaulted or raped.\u201d (Id.) Trooper\nbelieved that Claimant\u2019s statement that she did not want to get Coworker in trouble\nand Claimant\u2019s responses to Trooper\u2019s written questions and answers agreeing that\nClaimant had not been raped or sexually assaulted supported this position. (Id.)\nAccordingly, Trooper decided to terminate the investigation. (Id.)\n       On cross-examination, Trooper admitted that Claimant stated that she \u201cpushed\n[Coworker] away but not as much as she should have.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(f).) Further, Trooper\nstated he \u201cd[id] not know what a leading question is[]\u201d and admitted to not having\nreceived any \u201ctraining from a psychologist or mental health professional[]\u201d with\nregard to ascertaining \u201cthe state of mind of a sexual assault victim.\u201d (Id.) Trooper\n\u201cdid not find Claimant credible[] but rather thought she was upset about having a\nsexual affair\u201d with a married individual. (Id.) With regard to the specific questions\nasked of Claimant, Trooper \u201cagreed that the video showed that Claimant, when\nasked if she was sexually assaulted, responded by saying that she did not know\nwhether it was safe to say that.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(g).)\n\n\n              3.     EEO Director\u2019s Testimony\n       EEO Director testified as follows.10 EEO Director \u201cis tasked with overseeing\ndiscrimination complaints[,] training for diversity and sexual harassment[,]\u201d and\n\u201csexual harassment investigations.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(a).) EEO Director investigated\nClaimant\u2019s rape allegation, which \u201cconsisted of witness interviews, surveillance\nvideo review of Claimant\u2019s police interview, [and] review of text messages and\npolice reports.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(b).) In forming conclusions in the investigation, EEO\nDirector mostly relied on Claimant\u2019s agreement with Trooper\u2019s written answer that\n\n       10\n          EEO Director\u2019s January 10, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 456a through\n518a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 11.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fClaimant had not been sexually assaulted and Claimant\u2019s text message to Coworker\nin which Claimant used the term \u201clol.\u201d (Id.) EEO Director \u201cfelt this was strong\nevidence because Claimant\u201d first alleged having been raped \u201cbut then immediately\ntook it back\u201d during the interview with Trooper. (Id.) EEO Director also took a\nstatement from Officer, which \u201cconfirm[ed] that the first time Claimant learned that\n[Coworker] was married was during the course of [the] conversation with [Officer]\nwhere [Claimant] confided in [Officer] that [Claimant] did not have consensual\nintercourse with [Coworker].\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(e).) During EEO Director\u2019s interview with\nClaimant, Claimant \u201cconfirmed that Claimant was at first in denial that this was a\nsexual assault.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(f).) As to why Claimant denied that it was so to Trooper,\nClaimant stated that she \u201cfeared retaliation and was terrified.\u201d (Id.) During the\ninterview with Claimant, EEO Director explained that Claimant stated that she \u201ctold\n[Coworker] numerous times that she did not want to have sex with [Coworker].\u201d\n(Id. \u00b6 11(d).) EEO Director \u201ccould not reach any conclusions as to whether any\nconsensual sex occurred.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(f).)\n\n      D.    The WCJ\u2019s Decision\n      The WCJ reviewed the evidence and testimony submitted by the parties and\nmade factual findings and credibility determinations. First, the WCJ reviewed the\ntext messages between Claimant and Coworker. (Id. \u00b6 12; see R.R. at 213a-25a.)\nBased on the review, the WCJ found that \u201c[i]t is not possible to accurately ascribe\nsentiment or emotion to texts\u201d and \u201cthat the texts document that Claimant refused\n[Coworker\u2019s] advancements and overtures to have sex prior\u201d to the May 20, 2018\nincident. (Id. \u00b6 12.) Further, the WCJ found that these text messages showed that,\nafter the incident, \u201cClaimant confronted [Coworker]\u201d and explained that Claimant\nwas affected by the incident and that Claimant \u201ccould not ignore what had\n\n\n                                           12\n\fhappened.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ found that \u201c[t]hese texts [confronting Coworker] were\nsent before Claimant was told that [Coworker] was married.\u201d (Id.)\n      The WCJ also reviewed the videotape of Trooper\u2019s interview of Claimant.\n(Id. \u00b6 13.) The WCJ found that \u201ca review of the videotape in its entirety leaves no\nquestion that Claimant was the victim of a rape at work on May 20, 2018.\u201d (Id.)\nThe WCJ described that, during the interview with Trooper, Claimant is \u201cclearly[,]\nvisibly upset and cries uncontrollably at times when Trooper leaves the room.\u201d (Id.)\n\u201cAlthough Trooper [] encourages Claimant that this incident was more of a\nconsensual intercourse,\u201d the WCJ found that \u201cthe record is devoid of consent.\u201d (Id.)\nThe WCJ found \u201cit significant that Claimant was too upset to write a statement.\u201d\n(Id.) Further, the WCJ found Trooper\u2019s written question and answer approach did\nnot amount to \u201ca statement [by Claimant] but a series of questions which\npredetermine the answer in a yes or no fashion.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ characterized\nTrooper\u2019s approach as using \u201conly leading questions which when answered deny a\nrape.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ found Trooper\u2019s tactics \u201cmake it seem[] that Claimant only\ngot upset when she learned that [Coworker] was married[,]\u201d but \u201c[t]he videotape\ndocuments Claimant\u2019s lack of comfort with being compelled to answer yes or no and\nher hesitation in giving the answers.\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ concluded that\n\u201c[t]he videotape supports Claimant\u2019s testimony that she was raped at work on May\n20, 201[8].\u201d (Id.)\n      Turning to credibility determinations, the WCJ determined Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony was credible and persuasive. (Id. \u00b6 14.) The WCJ explained \u201cClaimant\u2019s\ncomposure and demeanor during [] live testimony and [the WCJ\u2019s] observation of\nthe videotape interview\u201d with Trooper to be significant in making this credibility\ndetermination. (Id.) The WCJ found that Claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent in\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthat Claimant \u201cnever gave her consent to be penetrated by\u201d Coworker, told\nCoworker no, and rebuffed Coworker\u2019s advancements before the incident. (Id.)\nFurther, the WCJ noted that Claimant \u201cnever had any difficulty performing her job\nduties\u201d and \u201cnever sought any mental health treatment or experienced any mental\nhealth illness prior to\u201d the incident. (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ accepted Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony as fact. (Id.)\n      Regarding Dr. Wiley\u2019s and Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found \u201cthat the\ntestimony of Dr. Wiley was more credible and persuasive than the testimony of Dr.\nBora.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 15.) The WCJ explained that \u201cDr. Wiley\u2019s testimony is more credible\nbecause it is consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony[,] which has been\naccepted as fact. As Claimant\u2019s treating psychologist, [Dr. Wiley] was more familiar\nwith the rape, Claimant\u2019s report of the rape, her treatment and her devolution into a\ncrisis in August of 2018.\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ accepted Dr. Wiley\u2019s\ntestimony in its entirety as fact. (Id.)\n      Conversely, the WCJ deemed Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony to be \u201cnot credible or\npersuasive because [Dr. Bora] believed Claimant to have mental health issues in the\npast because of one note in her family doctor\u2019s records from December 7, 2016,\u201d\ndespite the fact that \u201c[t]here is no other indication that Claimant sought mental health\ntreatment or had a mental health illness.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 16.) Further, the WCJ noted that\nDr. Bora believed that Claimant was not raped \u201cbecause[,] in [Dr. Bora\u2019s] opinion,\nClaimant flirted with\u201d Coworker and also because Claimant \u201chad a prior sexual\nrelationship with\u201d Coworker. (Id.) With respect to Claimant\u2019s perception changing\nafter discovering that Coworker was married, the WCJ found that Dr. Bora\n\u201ccompletely misstates the timeline of Claimant\u2019s distress over her rape which was\nimmediate.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ explained Dr. Bora\u2019s misunderstanding of the timeline,\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fas \u201cClaimant only found out [Coworker] was married after Officer asked why\nClaimant was sad\u201d and Claimant told Officer about the incident. (Id. (emphasis\nadded).) Finally, the WCJ found that Dr. Bora \u201clacks credibility because he admits\nthat if Claimant were a private patient, he would not question whether or not she had\nbeen sexually assaulted but would focus on treatment[,] assuming the history to be\ntrue.\u201d (Id.) Finding Dr. Bora\u2019s opinions to be \u201cbiased and without competent factual\nfoundation,\u201d the WCJ rejected Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony in its entirety. (Id.)\n      As for Trooper\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found that \u201cTrooper [] testified\naccurately as to how he conducted the interview with Claimant[]\u201d but did \u201cnot find\n[Trooper\u2019s] conclusions that the assault on Claimant was consensual sexual\nintercourse credible or persuasive.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 18.) Finding that Claimant never\nconsented but specifically said \u201cno,\u201d the WCJ added that the facts that Claimant\n\u201cadmits she froze\u201d and that she \u201cshould have fought [Coworker] off more . . . do not\nmake the forced intercourse consensual.\u201d (Id.) As for Trooper\u2019s interview with\nClaimant, the WCJ found the questions to be leading in nature because \u201call of the\nquestions he wrote for Claimant that p[ur]port to be \u2018her\u2019 statement[] presuppose an\nanswer compelling a conclusion that the sex was consensual, and [that] Claimant\nwas upset\u201d because she discovered that Coworker was married. (Id.) The WCJ\nexplained that Trooper\u2019s \u201creasoning does not support that the rape did not occur[]\u201d\nand that Trooper\u2019s reliance on a lack of \u201cviolence\u201d is in error where there was no\nconsent. (Id.)\n      Turning to EEO Director\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found the testimony not\ncredible or persuasive. The WCJ noted that EEO Director \u201crelied heavily on the\ninterview of Claimant by Trooper [] and the text messages.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 21.) Given that\nthe WCJ \u201chas found both not credible to defeat Claimant\u2019s\u201d competent and\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fpersuasive testimony concerning the incident, the WCJ determined that EEO\nDirector\u2019s \u201cinvestigation and testimony [were] not based on a competent factual\nfoundation and [] rejected\u201d them. (Id.)\n       Finally, despite that Officer did not provide testimony in this matter, the WCJ\nstated that she found Officer\u2019s testimony consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony and\naccepted it as fact. (Id. \u00b6 17.) Further, in discussing Claimant\u2019s credibility, the WCJ\nfound that \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony is also supported by the testimony of Officer[].\u201d\n(Id. \u00b6 14.)\n       Accordingly, the WCJ found that \u201c[o]n May 20, 2018, Claimant was raped in\nthe control bubble of the [RHU] by [Coworker.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 22.) The WCJ explained\nthat the burden of proof in this \u201cmental/mental case\u201d requires \u201cproof of an abnormal\nworking condition\u201d and found that \u201c[f]orced sexual intercourse without consent is a\nrape[]\u201d and that \u201c[r]ape is never a normal working condition.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 23.) The WCJ\nfound that the incident caused Claimant to sustain a psychological injury in the form\nof post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, and that this injury was \u201cnot\na subjective reaction to a normal working condition[]\u201d but has been \u201cobjectively\nverified by Dr. Wiley.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; WCJ\u2019s Conclusions of Law (COL) \u00b6 2.) As\na result, the WCJ concluded, \u201cClaimant became totally disabled effective August 10,\n2018.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 25; COL \u00b6 3.) Employer appealed the WCJ\u2019s Decision to the Board.\n\n       E.       The Board\u2019s Opinion11\n       On appeal to the Board, Employer argued that:                  (1) \u201cthe WCJ lacked\njurisdiction to decide whether Claimant was raped and[,] in doing so[,] violated the\ncriminal due process rights of [Coworker]\u201d; (2) the WCJ\u2019s Decision was not\nsupported by substantial, competent evidence; (3) the WCJ capriciously disregarded\n\n       11\n            The Board\u2019s Opinion is found at pages 47a through 60a of the Reproduced Record.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fevidence; and (4) the WCJ \u201cerroneously found Claimant\u2019s testimony was\ncorroborated by Officer[.]\u201d (Board Opinion (Op.) at 2.)\n      First, the Board concluded that Claimant satisfied the \u201cburden of proving by\nobjective evidence that [Claimant] sustained a psych[ological] injury and that such\ninjury was other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions.\u201d (Id. at\n11.) The Board explained that Claimant provided proof that she suffered from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder through her \u201ccredited\ntestimony as to an actual event and the credited testimony of her treating\npsychologist[,] Dr. Wiley.\u201d (Id.) Because \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony was not limited to\n[a] belief of subjective, abnormal conditions[] but rather included [Claimant\u2019s own]\ndescription . . . of an actual, specific event[,]\u201d the question of credibility was solely\nfor the WCJ to make within her discretion. (Id.) Given that the WCJ found that\n\u201cClaimant was physically assaulted causing her to sustain a psychological injury[,]\u201d\nthe Board determined that the credited testimonies of Claimant and Dr. Wiley\n\u201cconstitute[d] substantial, competent evidence [that] Claimant sustained work-\nrelated\u201d injuries rendering Claimant \u201ctotally disabled ongoing from August 10,\n2018.\u201d (Id.) The Board added that the fact that \u201cClaimant provided a signed\nstatement to the . . . State Police denying rape or sexual assault does not diminish\nthe substantial, competent evidence supporting the WCJ\u2019s Decision.\u201d (Id.) Because\nClaimant\u2019s testimony regarding the event was found credible, and given that the\nmedical evidence from Dr. Wiley \u201cunequivocally established that the abnormal\nworking conditions caused psych[ological] injuries,\u201d the Board concluded that \u201cthe\nWCJ did not err in finding a compensable injury.\u201d (Id. at 12.)\n      Turning to Employer\u2019s contention that \u201cthe WCJ\u2019s finding that Claimant was\nphysically assaulted or made reference to the word \u2018rape\u2019 is [] tantamount to a\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fcriminal conviction[,]\u201d the Board explained that while \u201ca determination as to\nwhether the crimes of sexual assault or rape occurred were outside [the WCJ\u2019s]\nspecific jurisdiction, the WCJ was well within her purview to determine whether\nClaimant was subjected to abnormal working conditions[.]\u201d (Id. (emphasis added).)\nThe Board stated that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act12 (Act) \u201cis applicable to all\ninjuries occurring within Pennsylvania[.]\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the Board explained,\n\u201c[a] WCJ may analyze evidence concerning incidents on the job leading to disability,\neven if that evidence implicates criminal conduct[,]\u201d comparing the WCJ\u2019s finding\nhere to those in Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Workers\u2019 Compensation\nAppeal Board (Kochanowicz), 108 A.3d 922 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014); Miller v. Workers\u2019\nCompensation Appeal Board (New Wilmington Family Practice), 724 A.2d 971 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1999); and Archer v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (General\nMotors and Royal Insurance Co.), 587 A.2d 901 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1991). (Board\u2019s Op.\nat 12.)     \u201cThat the same set of facts can lead to litigation in other legal or\nadministrative arenas with their own burdens of proof and procedural rules[,]\u201d the\nBoard held, \u201cis not a usurpation of those arenas.\u201d (Id. at 12-13.) The Board further\nemphasized that its \u201caffirmance of the WCJ\u2019s findings of an abnormal working\ncondition based on substantial, competent evidence does not relate to or overlap with\nthe determination of whether a criminal act did or did not occur.\u201d (Id. at 13 n.3.)\n      The Board then addressed Employer\u2019s position that August 10, 2018, was not\nthe proper date of disability because Dr. Wiley did not document that Claimant\nshould not be working until September 4, 2018. The Board explained that \u201cthe\nrecord indicates that August 10, 2018[,] was the date Claimant ceased working due\nto her ongoing symptoms of depression and anxiety.\u201d (Id.) \u201cBecause the WCJ\n\n\n      12\n           Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.4, 2501-2710.\n\n\n                                               18\n\fcredited Claimant\u2019s testimony in that regard, [the Board] decline[d] to disturb that\ndate on appeal[]\u201d as those \u201ccredibility determinations were not made arbitrarily and\ncapriciously and [the WCJ\u2019s] findings are supported by substantial evidence[.]\u201d (Id.\n(citations omitted).)\n       Finally, the Board turned to Employer\u2019s argument that \u201cthe WCJ erred by\nfinding Claimant\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Officer as that testimony is absent\nfrom the record.\u201d (Id.) Agreeing that Officer\u2019s testimony was not in the record, the\nBoard nonetheless concluded that the WCJ\u2019s error in so stating was \u201charmless as this\nabsent testimony was explicitly found to be consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony,\nwhich is part of the record and was found credible.\u201d (Id. at 13-14 (citing Benson v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Haverford State Hosp.), 668 A.2d 244, 248-49 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 1995)).) Accordingly, the Board affirmed the WCJ\u2019s Decision.13 Employer\nnow petitions for review.14\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.  Whether the WCJ had authority to find that the May 20, 2018 incident\n           occurred as Claimant testified.\n              1.     Parties\u2019 Arguments\n       Employer argues that the WCJ erred in denying its Motion to Dismiss the\nClaim Petition and granting the Claim Petition because the WCJ lacked the authority\nto determine that the May 20, 2018 work incident occurred and that, in doing so,\nacted outside of the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Employer posits that the General Assembly\n\u201cvested the power to prosecute criminal matters in the Attorney General\u201d and district\n\n       13\n         Two of the Board\u2019s Commissioners concurred in the result only.\n       14\n          Our scope of review in workers\u2019 compensation matters \u201cis limited to determining\nwhether constitutional rights have been violated, whether an error of law has been committed[,]\nand whether all necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Archer, 587\nA.2d at 903.\n\n\n                                              19\n\fattorneys and that the statute vesting such authority \u201cis unambiguous and should be\nread as a restriction on any other party acting to investigate criminal offenses\u201d under\nthe plain meaning of the statute\u2019s language. (Employer\u2019s Brief (Br.) at 31 (citing\nSection 206 of the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-206).15) Because\nthe Act does not give a WCJ any authority to investigate or determine whether a\ncrime was committed and only confers prosecution powers to district attorneys for\npurposes of insurance fraud, Employer asserts, the WCJ was without authority to\ndetermine that Coworker raped Claimant. (Id. at 32.) Employer posits that the Board\n\u201cadmit[ted] that the WCJ made a determination that a criminal act did occur \u2013\nsomething that [it] also admit[ted] is outside [the WCJ\u2019s or Board\u2019s] jurisdiction.\u201d\n(Id. at 33.)\n       Additionally, Employer argues that the WCJ violated Coworker\u2019s due process\nrights by determining that Coworker had raped Claimant. Given that Coworker \u201cdid\nnot have the ability to confront his accuser[,]\u201d and \u201cdid not have the opportunity to\nbe heard, since any statements [Coworker] ma[de] could be used against [Coworker]\nin the future[,]\u201d Employer contends that \u201cCoworker was tried and administratively\ndetermined to be a rapist in absentia.\u201d (Id. at 35.) Further, recognizing that\nCoworker \u201cdoes not face criminal prosecution or confinement as a result of the\nWCJ\u2019s Decision,\u201d Employer posits that Coworker does face \u201cvery real private and\npublic scorn and humiliation by the WCJ\u2019s finding that [Coworker] raped Claimant.\u201d\n(Id. at 35-36.) Employer argues that \u201c[t]his violation of [Coworker\u2019s] due process\nrights is akin to vigilante justice wherein [Coworker] has been branded a rapist by\nsomeone not authorized or capable to do so, and this branding shall remain in\n[Coworker\u2019s] file for the remainder of [Coworker\u2019s] career.\u201d (Id. at 36.)\n\n\n       15\n            Act of October 15, 1980, P.L. 950, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 732-101 \u2013 732-506.\n\n\n                                               20\n\f       Claimant responds, arguing that the WCJ acted within her jurisdiction.\nClaimant asserts that a WCJ is \u201cempowered to find that an incident or circumstances\non the job, if it rises to the level of abnormal working conditions, can cause\npsychological injuries.\u201d (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 12 (citing Martin v. Ketchum, 568 A.2d\n159 (Pa. 1990)).) Claimant asserts that \u201cwork-related injuries are [often] caused by\nconduct that entails potential criminal actions\u201d and compares this case to that in\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board\n(Cantarella), 835 A.2d 860 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003), where the claimant, an instructor at\na state prison, was touched inappropriately by an inmate and later developed anxiety\nand post-traumatic stress disorder. (Id. at 12-13.) Claimant argues \u201cthat the finding\nof fact . . . does not amount to a conviction; rather, the finding of fact was simply a\nrecognition that the incident was work-related, abnormal, and caused disabling\npsychological conditions,\u201d which Claimant maintains is within the WCJ\u2019s authority.\n(Id. at 13.)\n       Claimant argues that \u201c[t]he same set of facts can lead to litigation in\u201d the\n\u201cspheres\u201d of criminal, civil, and administrative law, \u201ceach with their own separate\nburdens of proof and procedural rules.\u201d (Id. at 14.) Claimant further contends that\nEmployer\u2019s \u201cattempt to analogize this to the [insurance] fraud provision of the Act\n. . . is likewise meritless.\u201d (Id. at 15.) Claimant cites Section 1110 of the Act, 77\nP.S. \u00a7 1039.10,16 which states that \u201c[n]othing contained in this article shall be\nconstrued to limit the regulatory or investigative authority of any department or\nagency of the Commonwealth[,]\u201d as support that \u201ca WCJ may consider and rule upon\nallegations of fraudulent conduct arising in an active workers\u2019 compensation\nmatter.\u201d (Id. (quoting 77 P.S. \u00a7 1039.10) (internal citations omitted).) Finally,\n\n\n       16\n            Section 1110 was added by Section 20 of the Act of July 2, 1993, P.L. 190.\n\n\n                                                21\n\fClaimant argues that Employer\u2019s \u201cassertions that [] due process[17] or Confrontation\nClause[18] principles are implicated here are no less ridiculous than its position that a\nWCJ may not adjudicate matters involving criminal activity or conduct by an\nindividual.\u201d (Id. at 16.)\n       In its Reply Brief, Employer asserts that Claimant provided no authority for\nthe assertion that work-related injuries often stem from potentially criminal conduct.\nFurther, Employer argues that this Court in Cantarella rejected that the claimant had\nbeen subjected to abnormal working conditions and also any \u201cper se\u201d rule that any\nspecific conduct automatically qualifies as an abnormal working condition.\n(Employer\u2019s Reply Br. at 1-2.) Further, Employer argues that \u201cClaimant and the\nWCJ want to be able to call someone a rapist and determine that a rape occurred[]\nbut then claim it has no meaning or impact outside the workers\u2019 compensation\n\n\n\n       17\n          Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in\nrelevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law[.]\u201d U.S. CONST. amend.

Analysis\n      For the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation matters, the Act \u201cappl[ies] to all\ninjuries occurring within this Commonwealth[.]\u201d Section 101 of the Act, 77 P.S.\n\u00a7 1. To provide compensation to injured workers, \u201ca WCJ and the Board are\nauthorized by the Act to determine whether or not an employee who alleges [the\nemployee] was injured during the course of [their] employment is entitled to\ncompensation.\u201d Heath v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole),\n860 A.2d 25, 30 (Pa. 2004). In doing so, a WCJ is required to make credibility and\nevidentiary determinations, to make findings as to the facts underlying the matter,\nand to determine whether a claimant has met the burden of proving entitlement to\ncompensation, and with regard to these findings and determinations, \u201cthe WCJ is the\nultimate finder of fact and the exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary\nweight.\u201d Thompson v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (USF&G Co.), 781 A.2d 1146,\n1150 (Pa. 2001).\n      It is well settled that work-related psychological injuries are compensable\nunder Section 301(c)(1) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1). Archer, 587 A.2d at 313. Our\nSupreme Court has explained that a claimant\u2019s burden of proof to recover benefits\nfor a psychological injury is twofold, requiring the claimant first to \u201cprove by\nobjective evidence that [the claimant] has suffered a psych[ological] injury and[,\nsecond,] that such injury is other than a subjective reaction to normal working\nconditions.\u201d Davis v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Swarthmore Borough), 751 A.2d\n168, 174 (Pa. 2000) (citing Martin, 568 A.2d at 159). \u201cEven if a claimant shows\nactual, not merely perceived or imagined, employment events that have precipitated\n\n\n                                         23\n\f[a] psych[ological] injury, the claimant must still prove the events to be abnormal in\norder to recover.\u201d Id. (citing Wilson v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Aluminum\nCo. of Am.), 669 A.2d 338 (Pa. 1996)). Further, given the fact-intensive nature of\npsychological injury cases, \u201cin determining whether actual working conditions are\nabnormal, they must be considered in the context of the specific employment.\u201d U.S.\nAirways v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Long), 756 A.2d 96, 101 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2000).\n      Here, Employer argues that the WCJ lacked authority to determine that\nClaimant had been raped or sexually assaulted by Coworker and that, in doing so,\nthe WCJ violated Coworker\u2019s due process rights. We disagree. The Act extends to\n\u201call injuries occurring within this Commonwealth[,]\u201d including those where the\nevidence implicates criminal conduct. 77 P.S. \u00a7 1.\n      Contrary to Employer\u2019s arguments, courts have found abnormal working\nconditions and granted benefits in other instances where the evidence implicated\ncriminal conduct. For instance, in RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v.\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Hopton), 912 A.2d 1278 (Pa. 2007), the\nclaimant alleged to have been the victim of sexual harassment by the claimant\u2019s\nsupervisor. In holding that the harassment constituted abnormal working conditions\nwhere the supervisor harassed the claimant intensely and with high frequency, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court also noted that the supervisor\u2019s conduct \u201carguably\nconstitute[d] criminal harassment.\u201d Id. at 1288. There was no indication that this\nlimited the WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction to decide whether the injury occurred and\nwas compensable.\n      Similarly, in Kochanowicz, the claimant alleged to have been the victim of an\narmed robbery while working at the employer\u2019s retail store. The claimant averred\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fthat the robbery caused him post-traumatic stress disorder. After considering that\nthe claimant had received workplace training for such an incident, we nonetheless\nupheld the WCJ\u2019s finding that the robbery constituted abnormal working conditions\ngiven that the claimant had not experienced workplace violence in his 30-year\nemployment. Kochanowicz, 108 A.3d at 934. Again, there was no impediment to\nthe WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction. Likewise, in Philadelphia Electric Co. v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Miller), 643 A.2d 1186 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n1994), the claimant, a meter reader, alleged to have been chased by a dog while\nworking. The claimant further averred that the dog\u2019s owner then threatened to kill\nthe claimant and proceeded to then chase the claimant with a gun. We determined\nthat this conduct constituted an abnormal working condition that caused the claimant\npsychological injuries.\n      Finally, in Donovan v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Academy\nMedical Realty), 739 A.2d 1156 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999), the claimant alleged an injury\nduring employment as a janitor in a medical office resulting from exposure and\nwounding by hypodermic needles that were improperly disposed of. We held that\nthis constituted an abnormal working condition, especially because improper\ndisposal of infectious waste carried both civil and criminal penalties. Id. at 1163.\n      In these cases, the evidence implicated criminal conduct resulting in the\nclaimants\u2019 injuries by actors who were not parties in the proceeding. Nonetheless,\nthe WCJs and the Board were within their purview to determine that a compensable\ninjury resulted from conduct that occurred in the course of the claimants\u2019\nemployment. These cases demonstrate that although the evidence may implicate\ncriminal conduct, this does not limit the WCJ\u2019s or the Board\u2019s authority and\njurisdiction to determine that a compensable, work-related injury occurred.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      While Employer argues that \u201cthe Act does not give a WCJ jurisdiction over\ncriminal matters to make findings of criminal wrongdoing and to [grant or] suspend\nbenefits based thereon[,]\u201d that is not what occurred. See, e.g., Brehm v. Workers\u2019\nComp. Appeal Bd. (Hygienic Sanitation Co.), 782 A.2d 1077, 1087 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2001) (Friedman, J., dissenting). As the Board astutely stated:\n\n      We emphasize that our affirmance of the WCJ\u2019s finding of an abnormal\n      working condition based on substantial, competent evidence does not\n      relate to or overlap with the determination of whether a criminal act did\n      or did not occur . . . . We acknowledge that the authority to prosecute\n      the crimes of sexual assault and rape rests with the criminal justice\n      system alone, which applies differing procedural rules and burdens of\n      proof.\n\n(Board\u2019s Op. at 13 n.3.) The WCJ\u2019s findings in this case did not constitute a legal\ndetermination that Coworker criminally raped or sexually assaulted Claimant. As\nEmployer recognizes, there has been no criminal process in this matter, and\nCoworker \u201chere does not face criminal prosecution or confinement[.]\u201d (Employer\u2019s\nBr. at 35.) This was an administrative proceeding, and the WCJ did not apply the\nelements of the statutory provisions criminalizing rape and sexual assault or the very\nhigh standard of proof employed in criminal matters.\n      Here, the WCJ made credibility determinations, and found there was\nsubstantial evidence that Claimant was subjected to nonconsensual sexual\nintercourse at work, that this was an abnormal working condition, and that she\nsustained a resulting psychological injury which was not a subjective reaction to a\nnormal working condition. This was within the WCJ\u2019s authority. That the WCJ also\nopined that such conduct amounted to rape does not render the WCJ\u2019s findings in\nerror or diminish the WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction. As the Board recognized, \u201ca\ndetermination of whether a criminal act did or did not occur\u201d was outside of the\n\n                                         26\n\fBoard\u2019s or the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction. (Employer\u2019s Br. at 33 (citing Board Op. at 13\nn.3).) The Board correctly emphasized that the WCJ\u2019s findings of fact in these\nmatters do not amount to a determination as to any criminal liability stemming from\nthe conduct at issue. (See Board\u2019s Op. at 13 n.3.)\n      Because Coworker is not a party, this is not a criminal proceeding, and there\nis no risk of an adverse adjudication as to Coworker, we also disagree that the WCJ\u2019s\nDecision implicates Coworker\u2019s due process rights or the Confrontation Clause.\nEmployer cites no authority to support such a proposition.            Indeed, that the\nConfrontation Clause concerns the rights of criminal defendants \u201c[i]n . . . criminal\nprosecutions[]\u201d belies that position. U.S. CONST. amend. VI.\n      Finally, we note that adopting Employer\u2019s position would be contrary to the\npurpose of the Act, which ensures that injured employees have a process available\nto seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Such a decision would render heinous\nconduct in the workplace that causes injury to go unchecked and would prevent\nemployees injured on the job by such conduct from seeking compensation and\nredress of injury. This is especially true in light of the fact that the Act \u201creplace[d]\ntraditional common law rights and remedies[]\u201d in regard to an employee\u2019s recovery\nfor work-related injury against an employer. East v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd.\n(USX Corp./Clairton), 828 A.2d 1016, 1021 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003). Thus, we agree\nwith Claimant that any potential criminal liability for conduct that is at issue in a\nworkers\u2019 compensation matter does not negate a WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction and authority.\nAccordingly, the WCJ and the Board did not err on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      B.       Whether the Board erred in holding that corroboration was not\n               necessary to prove that an abnormal working condition occurred.\n               1.       Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer argues that the WCJ and the Board erred in holding that \u201cit is not\nnecessary to determine if an actual rape or sexual assault occurred because all\nClaimant had to do was demonstrate abnormal working conditions and an \u2018actual\nevent\u2019 that caused [Claimant\u2019s] alleged injuries.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 39.) Employer\nmaintains that \u201ccorroboration was necessary[]\u201d to show that the \u201csexual act . . . [was]\nunwanted\u201d and that the Board erred in not so requiring. (Id. at 40.) Employer likens\nthe WCJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s determinations to \u201csupport the idea that a claimant can\nallege that aliens came down and injured her at work\u201d and that \u201conly [the] claimant\u2019s\ntestimony that it happened would be required to sustain a compensable claim.\u201d (Id.\nat 41-42.)\n      In response, Claimant argues that corroborative evidence was not required in\nthis matter.        Claimant maintains that, in certain circumstances, corroborative\nevidence is not required to prove that an event constituting an abnormal working\ncondition occurred. (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 20 (citing Archer, 587 A.2d at 901).)\nClaimant asserts that \u201c[c]orroborative evidence is required to support the claimant\u2019s\ndescription of a general abnormal working environment that caused an injury;\nhowever, where a claimant testifies about actual events, corroborative evidence is\nnot required.\u201d (Id. at 18 (citing Donovan, 739 A.2d at 1156).) Because Claimant\nestablished that Claimant sustained work-related injuries as a result of an actual,\ndescribed event, Claimant maintains that the WCJ and the Board did not err.\n\n               2.       Analysis\n      As explained above, the claimant in workers\u2019 compensation matters alleging\na mental/mental injury carries the burden of proving that her injury was not a\n\n                                             28\n\fsubjective reaction to normal working conditions.         Normally, \u201ca claimant\u2019s\ntestimony of abnormal working conditions must be corroborated.\u201d            Reigle v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Fed. Exp.), 601 A.2d 1331, 1334 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1992)\n(citing Russella v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Nat\u2019l Foam Sys. Inc.), 497 A.2d\n290 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1985)). However, this Court created an exception to this general\nrule in Archer. There, the claimant alleged that harassment by the claimant\u2019s\nsupervisor caused the claimant psychological injury. The Board denied benefits,\nconcluding that the claimant was required to corroborate the allegation of\nmistreatment. We reversed, explaining that \u201c[t]he testimony of the claimant in this\ncase was not limited to her belief that she felt she was being harassed; she also\ndescribed actual events[.]\u201d    Archer, 587 A.2d at 907 (emphasis in original).\nAccordingly, we held that \u201c[w]hile objective evidence may well be necessary where\nan employee is describing subjective feelings, no such evidence is necessary where\nactual events are being described.\u201d Id. This Court explained that a contrary holding\nthat \u201crequire[d] such evidence would allow an employer to mistreat its employees\nwith impunity as long as such conduct was done in private.\u201d Id. at 906.\n      We addressed this exception again in Philadelphia Electric Co. There, the\nemployer argued that our holding in Archer was limited to harassment and\nmistreatment by an employer on its premises and was not extended to other\ncircumstances. We disagreed, explaining that \u201cArcher and its progeny contain no\nadmonition that these cases be limited in this manner.\u201d Phila. Elec. Co., 643 A.2d\nat 1189. Because the claimant there testified to actual, specific events with respect\nto being attacked by a dog and threatened with a gun by the dog\u2019s owner, testimony\nthat the WCJ found credible, we held that corroboration was not required. Id.; see,\ne.g., Donovan, 739 A.2d at 1163 (holding that the claimant\u2019s testimony of being\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\finjured by improperly disposed hypodermic needles did not require corroboration\nbecause the claimant was describing actual events); Monessen, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s\nComp. Appeal Board (Marsh), 631 A.2d 1119 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1993) (claimant who\ndescribed being nearly run over by an oiling wheel of a coke oven door did not need\nto present corroborative evidence of this event where the WCJ finds that such event\noccurred).\n      In the present case, Employer maintains that Claimant was required to present\ncorroborating evidence that the sexual intercourse was nonconsensual. We disagree.\nHere, Claimant testified that the sexual intercourse was nonconsensual, that\nClaimant told Coworker no, and that Coworker forced Claimant to engage in the\nintercourse using the force of Coworker\u2019s body weight. (FOF \u00b6 4(c), (n).) The WCJ\nfound Claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible and persuasive in light of \u201c[C]laimant\u2019s\ncomposure and demeanor during [Claimant\u2019s] live testimony[.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 14.) Similar\nto the claimant in Philadelphia Electric Co. who did not need to corroborate the\nallegations of harassment and mistreatment because the testimony related to an event\nand the WCJ found the testimony credible, 643 A.2d at 1189, Claimant here testified\nto actual, perceived events, not just Claimant\u2019s subjective reaction to normal\nworking conditions.    Moreover, the WCJ found Claimant\u2019s testimony to be\npersuasive and credible. (FOF \u00b6 14.)\n      Therefore, as determined in Archer, because Claimant was not testifying to\nhow an event made Claimant subjectively feel but describing an actual event,\nClaimant was not required to present corroborating evidence. 587 A.2d at 906-07.\nJust as such a holding in Archer would permit \u201can employer to mistreat its employees\nwith impunity as long as such conduct was done in private[,]\u201d such a decision here\nwould allow an employee to be forced into nonconsensual sexual intercourse in\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fprivate without redress for the psychological injuries. Id. at 906. Accordingly,\nbecause the facts presented in this case fit squarely in the exception under Archer,\nthe Board did not err in concluding that corroboration was not required and affirming\nthe WCJ\u2019s Decision.\n\n      C.   Whether the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and not\n      supported by substantial, competent evidence of record.\n             1.     Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer argues that the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and\nnot based on competent evidence. Employer asserts that the Board \u201cdid not mention\nthe conflicting evidence . . . in this case or the fact that the WCJ did not address the\nconflicting evidence but merely ignored [the] same.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 40.) First,\nEmployer submits that the WCJ erred in finding Dr. Wiley to be more credible than\nDr. Bora, alleging that Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony was contradictory to Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony and further \u201cdemonstrate[d] that Dr. Wiley was a paid puppet being\ndirected in his treatment of Claimant by [Claimant\u2019s attorney.]\u201d (Id. at 43.) Second,\nEmployer posits that the WCJ ignored contradictory evidence as to Claimant\u2019s\nalleged injuries and Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony and opinions. (Id. at 44-45.) Third,\nEmployer asserts that the WCJ misstated Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony with respect to his\nreliance on Coworker\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship. (Id. at 45 n.7.)\n      Finally, Employer asserts that the WCJ erred in ignoring substantial evidence\nthat the sexual intercourse was consensual. In addition to Claimant\u2019s statements to\nthe State Police that Claimant was not raped or sexually assaulted, Employer argues\nthat \u201c[t]he WCJ failed to accord proper weight to the prior sexual relationship\nbetween Claimant and [Coworker], as well as the sexual nature of [C]laimant\u2019s text[\nmessage]s to [Coworker] before and on May 20, 2018.\u201d (Id. at 41.) Moreover,\n\n\n                                          31\n\fEmployer asserts that substantial evidence shows \u201c[C]laimant only became upset\nabout this alleged interaction/incident and alleged that a rape/sexual assault took\nplace once she found out that [Coworker] was married and that she could not pursue\na relationship with [Coworker].\u201d (Id. at 46-47.) Employer maintains that the WCJ\u2019s\nfinding that Claimant was upset immediately after the incident was in error because:\nClaimant continued to work after the incident \u201cwithout any issues\u201d; Claimant did\nnot speak with anyone about the incident on May 20, 2018; Claimant used the term\n\u201clol\u201d when Claimant texted Coworker the following day after the incident; and the\nother text messages from Claimant to Coworker that \u201ctend to show a woman seeking\nout the attention of a man who she had a flirtatious relationship with and who she\nlater discovers is married.\u201d (Id. at 47.) Moreover, Employer asserts that the WCJ\nignored Claimant\u2019s \u201csigned statement\u201d given to the State Police that the incident was\nnot rape or sexual assault and that Claimant was more upset about learning that\nCoworker was married. (Id. at 48-49.) Employer maintains that Claimant only\nalleged that a rape or sexual assault occurred after Officer opined that Claimant had\nbeen raped and, moreover, that the evidence of record does not support that Claimant\nwas sexually assaulted or raped. (Id. at 50.)\n      Claimant responds that the Board properly affirmed the WCJ\u2019s findings\nbecause Claimant proved with objective evidence that Claimant\u2019s psychological\ninjury resulted from abnormal working conditions. Claimant argues that she proved\nthat the abnormal working condition in this case was the \u201cnon-consensual sexual\nintercourse forced upon her by [Coworker],\u201d and that Employer\u2019s arguments \u201care\nlittle more than meritless attacks on the WCJ\u2019s credibility determinations, which are\nwell-reasoned and supported by substantial evidence of record.\u201d (Claimant\u2019s Br. at\n21.) Claimant maintains that the WCJ thoroughly explained the WCJ\u2019s credibility\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fdeterminations and that Employer\u2019s position \u201cattempts to manipulate the evidence\nand overcome a nuanced and clearly well-reasoned and supported decision by the\nWCJ[.]\u201d (Id. at 25.)\n      In its Reply Brief, Employer maintains that the evidence in this matter\n\u201creflects\u201d that: (1) \u201cClaimant clearly lied ([e]ither to [Trooper] or under oath in this\nproceeding)\u201d; (2) \u201cClaimant wanted a relationship with [Coworker]\u201d; (3) \u201cClaimant\nonly became upset when she realized [Coworker] was married\u201d; (4) \u201cClaimant never\nsought treatment until she obtained an attorney\u201d; and (5) \u201cClaimant\u2019s expert was\ntainted.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Reply Br. at 4.)\n\n             2.     Analysis\n      In workers\u2019 compensation cases, it is well settled \u201cthat the WCJ has the\nexclusive authority to make findings of fact and credibility determinations.\u201d Daniels\nv. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Tristate Transp.), 828 A.2d 1043, 1052 (Pa. 2003).\nThus, as stated above, in these matters, \u201c[t]he WCJ is the ultimate finder of fact and\nthe exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary weight.\u201d Thompson, 781 A.2d at\n1150. Our Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[t]he deference generally accorded to\nfact-finders in disputed proceedings is a function of the comparative advantage the\nfact-finder has over any reviewing body in making assessments that may depend,\ninter alia, upon the demeanor of witnesses.\u201d           Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052.\nAccordingly, the WCJ may reject or accept the testimony of any witness. A & J\nBuilders, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Verdi), 78 A.3d 1233, 1238 (Pa.\nCmwlth. 2013).\n      In reviewing the WCJ\u2019s credibility and evidentiary determinations, \u201c[i]t is\nirrelevant whether the record contains evidence to support findings other than those\nmade by the WCJ; the critical inquiry is whether there is evidence to support the\n\n\n                                          33\n\ffindings actually made.\u201d Furnari v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Temple Inland),\n90 A.3d 53, 60 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) (citation omitted). Thus, this Court\u2019s authority\nin these matters is limited to reviewing the entire record to see if it contains evidence\nthat a reasonable person might find sufficient to support the WCJ\u2019s findings. Id. If\nthe record contains such evidence, the findings must be upheld, even though the\nrecord may contain conflicting evidence. Id.\n       A capricious disregard only occurs when the WCJ deliberately ignores\nrelevant, competent evidence. Capasso v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (RACS\nAssocs., Inc.), 851 A.2d 997, 999 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004). Capricious disregard of\nevidence \u201cis a deliberate and baseless disregard of apparently trustworthy evidence.\u201d\nWilliams v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (USX Corp.-Fairless Works), 862 A.2d 137,\n144 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004). Nonetheless, \u201cwhere there is substantial evidence to\nsupport [a WCJ\u2019s] factual findings, and those findings in turn support the\nconclusions, it should remain a rare instance in which an appellate court would\ndisturb an adjudication based upon capricious disregard.\u201d Leon E. Wintermyer, Inc.\nv. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Marlowe), 812 A.2d 478, 487 n.14 (Pa. 2002).\n       Finally, a WCJ\u2019s decision must satisfy the reasoned decision requirements of\nSection 422(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. Section 422(a) provides, in relevant part,\nthat\n\n       [a]ll parties to an adjudicatory proceeding are entitled to a reasoned\n       decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon\n       the evidence as a whole which clearly and concisely states and explains\n       the rationale for the decisions so that all can determine why and how a\n       particular result was reached.\n\n77 P.S. \u00a7 834. To satisfy the reasoned decision requirements, a WCJ must set forth\nthe rationale for the decision by specifying the evidence relied upon and reasons for\n\n\n                                           34\n\faccepting it. Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1047; Dorsey v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd.\n(Crossing Constr. Co.), 893 A.2d 191, 194 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006). In the face of\nconflicting evidence, the WCJ \u201cmust adequately explain the reasons for rejecting or\ndiscrediting competent evidence.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. \u201cSection 422(a) does not require\nthe WCJ to discuss all of the evidence presented[]\u201d but only \u201cto make the findings\nnecessary to resolve the issues raised by the evidence and relevant to the decision.\u201d\nDorsey, 893 A.2d at 194 n.4. \u201c[T]he purpose of a reasoned decision is to spare the\nreviewing court from having to imagine why the WCJ believed one witness over\nanother[]\u201d and to \u201cpermit adequate appellate review.\u201d Id. at 194, 196.\n      In determining credibility, a WCJ may satisfy the reasoned decision\nrequirements by basing a credibility determination on a witness\u2019s demeanor during\nlive testimony. Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052-53. However, \u201c[w]here medical experts\ntestify by deposition, a WCJ\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence must be supported\nby more than a statement that one expert is deemed more credible than another.\u201d\nDorsey, 893 A.2d at 194. The WCJ must articulate an objective basis for credibility\ndeterminations in order to allow for effective appellate review. Id. Nevertheless,\n\u201cSection 422(a) does not permit a party to challenge or second-guess the WCJ\u2019s\nreasons for credibility determinations.\u201d Dorsey, 893 A.2d at 194.\n      Looking to the present case, Employer first argues that the WCJ erred in\ncrediting Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony over that of Dr. Bora. In order to comply with the\nreasoned decision requirements for the purposes of credibility determinations of\nexpert witnesses, the WCJ was required to provide \u201cmore than just a statement that\none expert is deemed more credible than another[]\u201d and to articulate an objective\ncredibility determination to allow for effective appellate review. Id. Here the WCJ\u2019s\ncredibility determination complied with the reasoned decision requirement because\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fit contained more than just a conclusory statement regarding the expert\u2019s credibility.\nThe WCJ explained that Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony was more credible and persuasive\nthan that of Dr. Bora because it was consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony\nand because Dr. Wiley was Claimant\u2019s treating psychologist and was, therefore,\nmore familiar with Claimant\u2019s experiences and symptoms. (FOF \u00b6 15.) The WCJ\nthen explained her rejection of Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony, stating that Dr. Bora\n\u201cmisstate[d] the time[]line of Claimant\u2019s distress\u201d over the incident, determined that\nClaimant had a history of mental illness solely from one note in her family doctor\u2019s\nrecords despite there being no other indication of previous mental illnesses, and\n\u201cadmit[ted] that if Claimant were a private patient, [Dr. Bora] would not question\nwhether or not she had been sexually assaulted but would focus on treatment\nassuming the history to be true.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 16.) Thus, we disagree that the WCJ erred\nin this credibility determination, as the WCJ articulated an objective basis for the\ndetermination. Dorsey, 893 A.2d at 194. Because \u201cSection 422(a) does not permit\na party to challenge or second-guess the WCJ\u2019s reasons for credibility\ndeterminations[,]\u201d id., and given that \u201c[t]he WCJ is the ultimate finder of fact and\nthe exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary weight[,]\u201d Thompson, 781 A.2d\nat 1150, we may not supplant the WCJ\u2019s credibility determinations with our own.\n      Employer next submits that the WCJ ignored contradictory evidence\nregarding inconsistencies between Dr. Wiley\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s testimony and \u201cthe\ncredible testimony of Dr. Bora.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 45.) Our review of the evidence\nsubmitted in this case and the WCJ\u2019s findings show that the WCJ complied with this\ndirective. The WCJ\u2019s findings permitted ample appellate review and do not force\nthis Court to \u201cimagine why the WCJ believed one witness over another[.]\u201d Id. As\nexplained above, the WCJ articulated objective reasons for finding Dr. Wiley\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\ftestimony credible and finding Dr. Bora to be not credible. Moreover, a WCJ need\nnot \u201cdiscuss all of the evidence presented[]\u201d but only \u201cto make the findings necessary\nto resolve the issues raised by the evidence and relevant to the decision.\u201d Dorsey\n893 A.2d at 194 n.4. Because it cannot be said that a reasonable person would not\nfind the evidence of record to support the WCJ\u2019s findings, Furnari, 90 A.3d at 60,\nand because substantial evidence exists to support those findings, Leon E.\nWintermyer, Inc., 812 A.2d at 487 n.14, it is not within this Court\u2019s authority to\ndisturb them.\n      Third, Employer argues that the WCJ mischaracterized Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony\nwith regard to Dr. Bora\u2019s reliance on Coworker and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship.\nThe WCJ found that Dr. Bora\u2019s position was that \u201cbecause . . . Claimant flirted with\u201d\nand \u201chad a prior sexual relationship with\u201d Coworker, Claimant was not raped. (FOF\n\u00b6 16.) Our review of Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony is consistent with this finding. After\nbeing asked whether Dr. Bora \u201cbelieved that some sort of rape or sexual assault\noccurred on May 20[], 2018[,]\u201d Dr. Bora testified: \u201cBased on the records that I\nreviewed, it\u2019s not clear to me that a rape occurred.        [C]laimant was texting\n[Coworker] immediately prior to the incident and after the incident, they had a\nhistory of sexual relations previously[, and i]t appeared they were having an ongoing\nflirtation[.]\u201d (R.R. at 653a.) Given the consistency between this testimony and the\nWCJ\u2019s finding, we disagree that the WCJ mischaracterized Dr. Bora\u2019s reliance on\nCoworker and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship.\n      Employer last argues that the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious\nbecause the WCJ ignored evidence showing that the sexual intercourse was\nconsensual. We disagree. A review of the WCJ\u2019s findings show that the WCJ\ncomplied with the reasoned decision requirements by \u201cadequately explain[ing] the\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\freasons for rejecting or discrediting competent evidence.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. With\nregard to the text messages that Claimant sent to Coworker after the May 20, 2018\nincident that used the term \u201clol,\u201d the WCJ found that it was \u201cnot possible to\naccurately ascribe sentiment or emotion to texts[,]\u201d but that Claimant sent the texts\nto \u201cconfront[ Coworker] by [] telling [Coworker] that she was upset over\u201d the\nincident, that Claimant\u2019s \u201cappetite was affected[,]\u201d \u201cthat she could not ignore what\nhad happened[,]\u201d and that Claimant \u201cfelt used and violated.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 12.) The WCJ\nalso found that \u201c[t]hese texts were sent before Claimant was told that [Coworker]\nwas married.\u201d (Id.) Next, with respect to the \u201csigned statement\u201d that Claimant gave\nto the State Police, the WCJ reviewed the videotape of Claimant\u2019s interview with\nTrooper and Trooper\u2019s testimony and determined that Trooper\u2019s conclusions that\nClaimant consented to the sexual intercourse and his interview and investigation\napproach were not reliable. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18.) The WCJ explained that Trooper\u2019s\ndecision to write questions that \u201cpresuppose an answer compelling a conclusion that\nthe sex was consensual\u201d amounted to a leading approach and that the resulting\ndocument did not constitute Claimant\u2019s \u201cstatement.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 18.) The WCJ also\ndisagreed with Trooper\u2019s opinion that Claimant was only upset because she found\nout that Coworker was married. (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ rejected Trooper\u2019s\nconclusions as to consent as unreliable and also did not credit Claimant\u2019s\n\u201cstatement\u201d due to the leading nature of the questions that Trooper wrote for\nClaimant. Id. These findings show that the WCJ did not \u201cdeliberate[ly] and\nbaseless[ly] disregard . . . apparently trustworthy evidence.\u201d Williams, 862 A.2d at\n144. Rather, the WCJ adequately explained the reasons for rejecting this evidence.\nWhile Employer asks this Court to instead determine that this evidence shows that\nthe sexual intercourse was consensual, such an evidentiary determination is within\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fthe discretion of the WCJ in these matters. Thompson, 781 A.2d at 1150. Because\nthe WCJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and complied with the\nreasoned decision requirements, the WCJ\u2019s findings were not arbitrary or capricious.\n\n      D.    Whether the WCJ\u2019s crediting of Officer\u2019s testimony as reliable and\n      consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony constituted reversible error.\n\n             1.    Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer last argues that the WCJ erred in finding Officer\u2019s testimony to be\ncredible because Officer did not testify in this matter. Because the WCJ found\nOfficer\u2019s testimony to be credible and accepted it as fact, Employer maintains that\nthe WCJ\u2019s credibility determination as to Claimant constituted reversible error, as\nthe WCJ relied in part on the consistency between Officer\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony.\n      Claimant acknowledges that the WCJ\u2019s finding that Officer\u2019s testimony was\ncredible was in error but asserts that this error was harmless because any statements\nalleged to have been made by Officer were merely cumulative of Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony and established through other evidence of record. (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 23.)\n\n\n             2.    Analysis\n      This Court has held that a WCJ\u2019s error is harmless where \u201cother competent\nevidence, standing alone, exists in the record to support the [WCJ\u2019s] findings.\u201d\nNabisco, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Cummings), 651 A.2d 716, 718-19\n(Pa. Cmwlth. 1994). In Nabisco, the WCJ erred by admitting hearsay evidence that\nsupported the finding that the claimant was injured while in the course of\nemployment. We held that the error was harmless because the WCJ also relied on\nthe testimony of other witnesses to support the WCJ\u2019s findings. Id. at 719.\n\n\n                                         39\n\f      Here, the WCJ\u2019s crediting of Officer\u2019s testimony was harmless error. While\nOfficer did not offer any testimony, the WCJ found that \u201c[t]he testimony of Officer\n[] has been reviewed and is found credible and persuasive.[19] [Officer\u2019s] testimony\nis consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony and is accepted as fact.\u201d (FOF\n\u00b6 17.) Further, the WCJ found that \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony is also support[ed] by the\ntestimony of Officer [].\u201d (Id. \u00b6 14.) However, the WCJ did not state what\nevidentiary findings were made based on Officer\u2019s testimony. With regard to using\nOfficer\u2019s testimony to support Claimant\u2019s testimony, the WCJ also relied on\nClaimant\u2019s demeanor during live testimony, Claimant\u2019s deposition testimony, and\nthe videotape interview with Trooper. Such evidence is more than sufficient for a\nWCJ\u2019s credibility determination, given that \u201ca WCJ may satisfy the reasoned\ndecision requirements by basing a credibility determination on a witness\u2019s demeanor\nduring live testimony.\u201d Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052-53. Moreover, there is nothing\nto suggest that the WCJ would not have made the same credibility determination as\nto Claimant without Officer\u2019s \u201ctestimony.\u201d Further, Claimant\u2019s testimony regarding\nthe conversation with Officer is also supported by the testimony of Employer\u2019s own\nwitness, EEO Director. (Id. \u00b6 11(d).) Accordingly, because \u201cother competent\nevidence, standing alone, exists to support the [WCJ\u2019s] findings,\u201d Nabisco Inc., 651\nA.2d at 718-19, any error of the WCJ in this matter was harmless.\n\n   III.    CONCLUSION\n      In sum: (1) the WCJ had the authority and jurisdiction to determine that\nabnormal working conditions caused Claimant\u2019s psychological injuries, regardless\nof whether the evidence implicates criminal conduct; (2) because Claimant credibly\n\n      19\n          After review, it appears that the WCJ misunderstood EEO Director\u2019s notes of the\ninterview with Officer to be Officer\u2019s testimony in this matter.\n\n\n                                           40\n\ftestified to actual events, corroboration was not necessary to prove that the abnormal\nworking conditions existed; (3) the WCJ\u2019s findings were not arbitrary and capricious\nand were supported by substantial evidence of record; and (4) the WCJ\u2019s crediting\nof Officer\u2019s testimony constituted harmless error. Accordingly, we affirm the\nBoard\u2019s Order.\n\n\n\n                                       _____________________________________\n                                       REN\u00c9E COHN JUBELIRER, Judge\n\n\n\n\nJudge Fizzano Cannon did not participate in the decision in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f       IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania,           :\nDepartment of Corrections - SCI         :\nChester,                                :\n                        Petitioner      :\n                                        :\n                  v.                    :   No. 150 C.D. 2021\n                                        :\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal            :\nBoard,                                  :\n                      Respondent        :\n\n\n                                     ORDER\n\n\n      NOW, November 10, 2021, the Order of Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal\nBoard, entered in the above-captioned matter, is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                      _____________________________________\n                                      REN\u00c9E COHN JUBELIRER, Judge\n\f",

The WCJ found that Claimant had proven that she suffered a work-related\npsychological injury as a result of being sexually assaulted while in the course of\nemployment and that Claimant was entitled to ongoing temporary total disability\nbenefits as of August 10, 2018. On appeal, Employer argues that:1 (1) the WCJ\nerred in denying its Motion to Dismiss the Claim Petition and granting the Claim\nPetition because the WCJ lacked the authority to determine that Claimant was\nraped/sexually assaulted and, therefore, violated the alleged perpetrator\u2019s due\n\n      1\n          We have reorganized the issues raised for ease of discussion.\n\fprocess rights in doing so; (2) the WCJ and the Board erred in not requiring\ncorroborating evidence to prove that Claimant suffered an abnormal working\ncondition; (3) the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and not based on\nsubstantial evidence; and (4) the WCJ committed reversible error by finding\ntestimony that was not submitted in this matter to be reliable and relying on this\ntestimony in its decision. After careful review, we affirm the Board\u2019s Order.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n      A.       The Claim Petition\n      Claimant worked for Employer as a corrections officer. (WCJ\u2019s Decision,\nFinding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 4(a).)2 Claimant filed the Claim Petition alleging that, \u201cas\na result of being sexually assaulted by a co-worker [(Coworker),]\u201d Claimant\ndeveloped a psychological injury. (Claim Petition at 2; FOF \u00b6 1.) The Claim\nPetition sought partial disability benefits starting May 20, 2018, the date of the work-\nrelated incident, and total disability benefits starting August 10, 2018, the date\nClaimant began taking sick leave due to the work-related injury. (Claim Petition at\n2; FOF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4(k).) Employer denied Claimant\u2019s allegations. (FOF \u00b6 2.) Employer\nfiled two Motions to Dismiss, challenging the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction or authority over\nthis matter, which the WCJ denied. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 17a.)\n\n\n      B.       Claimant\u2019s Evidence\n      In support of the Claim Petition, Claimant testified before the WCJ and\nsubmitted Claimant\u2019s prior deposition and the deposition of Justin Wiley, Psy.D., a\nlicensed clinical psychologist. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.)\n\n\n      2\n          The WCJ\u2019s Decision is found at pages 20a through 35a of the Reproduced Record.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f              1.       Claimant\u2019s Testimony\n       In Claimant\u2019s deposition, Claimant testified as follows.3 Claimant began\nworking at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Chester as a corrections officer in April\n2007. (Id. \u00b6 4(a), (b).) Prior to the May 20, 2018 incident, Claimant worked in\nCorridor B of the institution, which is the main corridor connecting the housing units\nin tower A to the Restricted Housing Unit (RHU). (Id.) During the incident on May\n20, 2018, Claimant was in the RHU\u2019s control bubble, which \u201cis an area where there\nare monitors and controls to open the doors and sliders in the actual unit.\u201d (Id.\n\u00b6 4(c).) Claimant had entered the RHU\u2019s control bubble to leave food in the\nrefrigerator. (Id.) When Claimant went to do so, Coworker approached Claimant\nfrom behind, kissed Claimant\u2019s ear, and began trying to undo the belt to Claimant\u2019s\nuniform pants. (Id.) \u201cDuring this time[,] Claimant was trying to push [Coworker]\noff, but [Coworker] was persistent.\u201d (Id.) Coworker then engaged in penetrative\nsexual intercourse with Claimant, while Claimant told Coworker no, that she \u201cdid\nnot want to[,] and [for Coworker] to stop.\u201d (Id.) The incident lasted between five\nand seven minutes, and Claimant continued working afterwards and finished that\nshift. (Id. \u00b6 4(d).)\n       Claimant had known Coworker for about two years prior to the May 20, 2018\nincident, and they had a prior sexual relationship in June 2017. (Id. \u00b6 4(g).) As of\n2018, \u201cClaimant considered their relationship a friendship more than a romance.\u201d\n(Id.) On May 12, 2018, eight days before the incident, Claimant texted Coworker,\nand the conversation \u201cwas friendly in nature.\u201d (Id.; see R.R. at 213a-14a.) Coworker\nthen texted Claimant on May 16, 2018, implying that Coworker wanted to have sex\nwith Claimant. (FOF \u00b6 4(g).) \u201cClaimant had previously discussed with [Coworker]\n\n       3\n         Claimant\u2019s September 17, 2018 deposition testimony is found at pages 113a through 211a\nof the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 4.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat she did not want to have sex[,]\u201d and Claimant again told Coworker the same\nover text. (Id.; R.R. at 215a-17a.)\n        Claimant texted Coworker the day after the incident concerning what\noccurred. (FOF \u00b6 4(h); R.R. at 221a-22a.) Specifically, Claimant stated, \u201cYou\nfinally got what you were requesting lol [(laugh out loud).]\u201d (R.R. at 222a.) After\nCoworker did not respond, Claimant again texted Coworker on May 23, 2018,4\nwriting that Claimant\u2019s appetite has been affected and that she could not ignore what\nhappened. (FOF \u00b6 4(h).) Following the May 20, 2018 incident \u201cClaimant was\nscared and did not know what to expect or how to take the situation.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(e).)\nClaimant \u201cfelt hurt and started to have crying spells and melt[]downs at the office.\u201d\n(Id.)\n        After another coworker (Officer) asked what was wrong because Claimant\nappeared upset, Claimant decided to discuss the incident with Officer. (Id. \u00b6 4(i).)\nAfter Claimant explained what occurred, Officer informed Claimant that Coworker\n\u201cwas married to someone with whom they work[,]\u201d of which Claimant was unaware.\n(Id.) Officer also opined that Claimant had been raped. (Id.) Upon learning the\ntruth about Coworker\u2019s marriage, Claimant decided to text Coworker again, stating,\n\u201cnow that I know the truth, I should have put up more resistance. But you would\nnot take no for an answer.\u201d (R.R. at 225a.) Claimant felt \u201cused and violated.\u201d (FOF\n\u00b6 4(h); R.R. at 225a.)\n        Claimant reported the incident to Employer on June 6, 2018. (FOF \u00b6 4(f).)\nAfter Claimant spoke with two superiors, the two accompanied Claimant to the\nPennsylvania State Police (State Police) Barracks. (Id.) \u201cWhen Claimant initially\nwent to the State Police, she did not want to pursue criminal charges because she\n\n        4\n        The WCJ stated the date as May 22, 2018, in the Findings of Fact, but the Reproduced\nRecord shows that Claimant sent these texts on May 23, 2018. (See R.R. at 222a-24a.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwas afraid of retaliation.\u201d (Id.) On June 11, 2018, Claimant was also interviewed\nby the Director of the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office for Employer\n(EEO Director), as a part of an EEO investigation regarding the incident. (Id. \u00b6\n4(o).)\n         Claimant began seeing Dr. Wiley on July 17, 2018. (Id. \u00b6 4(j).) Before the\nincident, Claimant \u201chad never seen a mental health professional or taken anti-\ndepressants or anti-anxiety medicine.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(b).) At the time of Claimant\u2019s\ndeposition, Claimant was treating with Dr. Wiley once per week and was also\nplanning to see a psychiatrist at Dr. Wiley\u2019s recommendation. (Id. \u00b6 4(j); R.R. at\n209a-10a.) Though Claimant had continued working after the incident, Claimant\nhad been \u201czoning out, was crying easily[,] and was irritable.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 4(j).) Further,\nClaimant \u201ccrie[d] more than normal[,]\u201d \u201cha[d] a hard time getting to sleep[,]\u201d \u201cha[d]\nflash[]backs and nightmares[,]\u201d \u201cha[d] [] began to suffer from anxiety attacks[,]\u201d\nand began becoming overwhelmed very easily. (Id. \u00b6 4(k), (s).) Claimant also\n\u201cbegan to isolate[,] lost weight[,]\u201d and began smoking more cigarettes. (Id. \u00b6 4(k).)\nWhile Claimant had been working a regular schedule as best as possible after the\nincident, Claimant decided to take sick leave starting August 10, 2018. (Id.)\n         On August 18, 2018, police went to Claimant\u2019s home after her \u201csister had\ncalled the police concerned that Claimant was suicidal.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(j).) Claimant had\nsent a text to her mother indicating an intent for self-harm, had been drinking alcohol\n\u201cin an attempt to numb her feelings and go to sleep[,]\u201d and \u201chad also taken some\nover[-]the[-]counter sleeping pills.\u201d (Id.) Police brought Claimant to the emergency\nroom and then transported Claimant to a crisis center, where she stayed from August\n19, 2018, through August 20, 2018. (Id.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f         On cross-examination, Claimant admitted to the prior sexual relationship with\nCoworker and Claimant\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding Coworker\u2019s marriage. (Id.\n\u00b6 4(m).) As to the incident itself, Claimant admitted that Coworker was not \u201cviolent\u201d\nbut explained that Coworker \u201cbent [Claimant] over the chair\u201d and \u201cput [Coworker\u2019s]\nweight on Claimant\u201d such that \u201cClaimant was unable to move forward or side to\nside.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 4(n)-(o).) Claimant discussed a statement written by a State Police\nTrooper (Trooper) following an interview on June 6, 2018, the day that Claimant\nreported the incident. (Id. \u00b6 4(p).) In that statement, \u201cClaimant responded [\u2018]no[\u2019]\nto being assaulted or raped by [Coworker]. Claimant was penetrated but [] did not\nwant to use the term \u2018rape or assault.\u2019\u201d (Id.) However, Claimant made clear that\nshe did not give Coworker permission to engage in sexual intercourse. (Id. \u00b6 4(t).)\n         At the hearing before the WCJ,5 Claimant stated that she attempted to press\ncharges and returned to the State Police to speak with Trooper, but Trooper refused\nto take her statement or reopen the investigation. (Id. \u00b6 5(c).) As to Claimant\u2019s\ninjury and conditions, Claimant explained that she: continues to treat with Dr. Wiley\nand is taking a generic anti-depressant; is \u201canxious and overwhelmed by having to\nrehash the details of the assault\u201d; \u201cstill has visions of the incident and night sweats\u201d;\nand continues to suffer from \u201canxiety and depression\u201d but is \u201ctrying to handle it as\nbest as she can.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 5(a)-(b).) Though \u201ctrying to utilize her children and family\nas support[,] there [we]re moments when [Claimant] just fe[lt] hopeless.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\n5(b).)\n\n\n\n\n         Claimant\u2019s testimony before the WCJ at the February 4, 2019 hearing is found at pages\n         5\n\n83a through 96a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding\nof Fact 5.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f              2.     Dr. Wiley\u2019s Testimony\n       Dr. Wiley testified by deposition as follows.6 Dr. Wiley first examined\nClaimant on July 17, 2018. (Id. \u00b6 6(a).) Dr. Wiley took a history from Claimant\nregarding the May 20, 2018 incident and the resulting symptoms that Claimant was\nexperiencing. (Id.) Dr. Wiley explained that \u201cClaimant was in a lot of distress and\nre-experiencing symptoms associated with trauma. There were symptoms common\nto post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d (Id.) Claimant \u201calso had symptoms associated\nwith hyper-arousal[,] such as panic and anxiety.\u201d (Id.) Claimant \u201chad insomnia,\n[feelings of] hopelessness, depressed mood[,] and appetite disturbance[,]\u201d as well as\n\u201csadness, pessimism[,] and anhedonia[,] which is a lack of pleasure in previously\npleasurable things.\u201d (Id.) Additionally, \u201cClaimant was self-critical, cried a lot[,]\nand had the feeling [of] being punished.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley conducted \u201ca mental status\nexamination\u201d and \u201ca Beck depression inventory,\u201d and \u201cClaimant scored on the\nsevere range on the depression inventory.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley also performed the \u201cBeck\nHopelessness Scale, which revealed Claimant to have a lot of despair and\nhopelessness around the future.\u201d (Id.) Finally, Dr. Wiley \u201cadministered the Brief\nSymptom Inventory[,] which incorporates all the other scales and tests\u201d and \u201cis\nhelpful in the consistency in making a diagnosis.\u201d (Id.) Given the evaluation, tests,\nand Claimant\u2019s history, Dr. Wiley \u201cdiagnosed Claimant with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and major depression[.]\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley opined that \u201c[t]he single episode\ncausing the major depression disorder was\u201d the May 20, 2018 incident. (Id.)\n       Dr. Wiley also reviewed the investigative reports from the State Police.\n(Id. \u00b6 6(c).) Dr. Wiley explained that Claimant \u201cwas under considerable stress and\ndiscussed significant fear of retaliation from\u201d Coworker and \u201cthat it was common\n\n       6\n         Dr. Wiley\u2019s November 13, 2018 deposition testimony is found at pages 240a through\n310a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 6.\n\n\n                                            7\n\famong rape victims to show reluctance or waffling. It does not mean that the rape\ndid not occur.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Wiley also reviewed the report from Brian Bora, M.D.,\nEmployer\u2019s expert, who conducted a psychiatric examination of Claimant. (Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 6(c), 7(a).) Dr. Wiley agreed that Claimant did not display \u201cany indications that\nClaimant was malingering or feigning symptoms.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 6(c).)\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Wiley admitted that \u201cClaimant had not seen any\nother physician or counselor for the\u201d May 20, 2018 incident. (Id. \u00b6 6(e).) Dr. Wiley\nalso admitted that it was not until after the September 4, 2018 examination of\nClaimant that Dr. Wiley first stated that Claimant was unable to work. (Id.) Finally,\nDr. Wiley testified \u201cthat Claimant ha[d] been indecisive about whether or not\n[Claimant] wanted to press charges.\u201d (Id.)\n\n       C.     Employer\u2019s Evidence\n       Employer submitted the deposition testimonies of Dr. Bora, Trooper, and\nEEO Director.7\n              1.      Dr. Bora\u2019s Testimony\n       Dr. Bora testified8 that he \u201cconducted a psychiatric examination of Claimant\non October 9, 2018[,]\u201d which involved taking a history from Claimant about the May\n20, 2018 incident and reviewing various records. (Id. \u00b6 7(a).) Dr. Bora testified that,\nwhile Claimant told Dr. Bora that she did not have any psychiatric history, \u201cthere\n\n       7\n         Employer also submitted the depositions of a lieutenant (Lieutenant) and major (Major)\nfor Employer, who are both in Claimant\u2019s chain of command. The testimonies are not relevant to\nthe present determination. The WCJ found that Lieutenant\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot credible or\npersuasive to defeat Claimant\u2019s allegation of rape by [Coworker]\u201d and that, while Major was\n\u201cgenerally credible,\u201d Major\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot determinative to any issue with regard to\nClaimant\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation claim[]\u201d and was, therefore, rejected. (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\nEmployer has not challenged the WCJ\u2019s determinations with respect to these witnesses.\n       8\n         Dr. Bora\u2019s January 22, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 628a through 684a of\nthe Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 7.\n\n\n                                               8\n\fwere family medicine notes from December 2016[] where [Claimant] did report to\nher family physician that she had depressive symptoms.\u201d (R.R. at 648a.) Based on\nthe records and the examination, \u201cDr. Bora opined that it was not clear . . . that\nClaimant had been raped.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 7(b).) Relying on Claimant\u2019s usage of \u201clol\u201d in\nthe text messages to Coworker and their prior sexual relationship, Dr. Bora \u201copined\nthat the situation was complicated . . . and there appeared to be an ongoing flirtation.\u201d\n(Id.) Dr. Bora asserted that \u201cClaimant\u2019s perception changed . . . when [Claimant]\nfound out that [Coworker] was married.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Bora also concluded from a\nDecember 7, 2016 report in which Claimant described feeling depressed to\nClaimant\u2019s family doctor \u201cto mean that Claimant did have a history of depression[.]\u201d\n(Id.) Accordingly, \u201cDr. Bora opined that Claimant did not sustain any work[-]related\ninjury.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 7(c).) While Dr. Bora recognized that \u201cClaimant reported depressive\nsymptoms after the\u201d May 20, 2018 incident, \u201cDr. Bora opined that it is most likely\ndue to\u201d Claimant being unemployed, Claimant\u2019s failed marriage, Claimant\u2019s co-\nworkers being cold to Claimant, and the difficulty of the surrounding situation. (Id.)\nDr. Bora maintained that \u201c[a]ny type of issues that Claimant currently has are not\nrelated to any incident at work.\u201d (Id.)\n      Dr. Bora also made the following admissions:               Dr. Bora \u201cha[d] not\ninterviewed sexual assault victims outside of his private practice[,] but some of his\npatients have been sexually assaulted\u201d; Dr. Bora \u201cdoes not draw conclusions within\nthe context of a treatment plan as to whether or not the sexual assault took place\u201d\nwhen treating patients in his private practice; and Dr. Bora \u201cdid not find Claimant to\nlack any credibility\u201d or \u201cfind any evidence of symptom magnification o[r] symptom\nfabrication[.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 7(d).) Dr. Bora also agreed that Claimant met all six criteria\nfor a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder but stated that, given \u201cthe text\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fmessages and the witness statement\u201d to the State Police, \u201cit was not clear that a rape\ndid occur.\u201d (Id.) Dr. Bora concluded that Claimant did not meet the criteria for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder \u201cbecause she continued to work\u201d after the May 20, 2018\nincident. (Id.)\n\n              2.     Trooper\u2019s Testimony\n       Trooper testified as follows.9 When Claimant went to the State Police with\ntwo superiors in June 2018, Trooper interviewed Claimant regarding the May 20,\n2018 incident. Claimant explained to Trooper \u201cthat she did not want anything done\nbut needed to tell her side of the story.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(b).) Trooper\u2019s interview with\nClaimant was video recorded. (Id.) \u201cClaimant was upset and crying but was willing\nto talk to\u201d Trooper, who listened to Claimant\u2019s recollection of the incident and took\nnotes. (Id.) \u201cWhen asked if Claimant would be able to write down [a] statement,\u201d\nClaimant said she would not. (Id.) Instead, Trooper \u201ccomposed questions for\nClaimant which required one[-]word answers.\u201d (Id.) Trooper then wrote out\npossible answers to those questions, \u201cgave Claimant an opportunity to disagree with\nthe statements[,]\u201d and had Claimant initial the answer with which Claimant agreed.\n(Id.) \u201cIn response to a question during this deposition as to whether or not Claimant\nsaid she was raped or sexually assaulted by [Coworker], Trooper responded that\nClaimant denied this.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(c).) Trooper also asked whether Claimant was more\nupset about finding out that Coworker was married, and Claimant answered in the\naffirmative. (Id.)\n       Trooper testified that there was an attempt to interview Coworker, but\nCoworker refused. (Id. \u00b6 8(d).) Based on Claimant\u2019s interview, Trooper opined that\n\n       9\n        Trooper\u2019s January 17, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 546a through 609a of\nthe Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 8.\n\n\n                                             10\n\f\u201cit appeared that [Claimant] was not sexually assaulted or raped.\u201d (Id.) Trooper\nbelieved that Claimant\u2019s statement that she did not want to get Coworker in trouble\nand Claimant\u2019s responses to Trooper\u2019s written questions and answers agreeing that\nClaimant had not been raped or sexually assaulted supported this position. (Id.)\nAccordingly, Trooper decided to terminate the investigation. (Id.)\n       On cross-examination, Trooper admitted that Claimant stated that she \u201cpushed\n[Coworker] away but not as much as she should have.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(f).) Further, Trooper\nstated he \u201cd[id] not know what a leading question is[]\u201d and admitted to not having\nreceived any \u201ctraining from a psychologist or mental health professional[]\u201d with\nregard to ascertaining \u201cthe state of mind of a sexual assault victim.\u201d (Id.) Trooper\n\u201cdid not find Claimant credible[] but rather thought she was upset about having a\nsexual affair\u201d with a married individual. (Id.) With regard to the specific questions\nasked of Claimant, Trooper \u201cagreed that the video showed that Claimant, when\nasked if she was sexually assaulted, responded by saying that she did not know\nwhether it was safe to say that.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 8(g).)\n\n\n              3.     EEO Director\u2019s Testimony\n       EEO Director testified as follows.10 EEO Director \u201cis tasked with overseeing\ndiscrimination complaints[,] training for diversity and sexual harassment[,]\u201d and\n\u201csexual harassment investigations.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(a).) EEO Director investigated\nClaimant\u2019s rape allegation, which \u201cconsisted of witness interviews, surveillance\nvideo review of Claimant\u2019s police interview, [and] review of text messages and\npolice reports.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(b).) In forming conclusions in the investigation, EEO\nDirector mostly relied on Claimant\u2019s agreement with Trooper\u2019s written answer that\n\n       10\n          EEO Director\u2019s January 10, 2019 deposition testimony is found at pages 456a through\n518a of the Reproduced Record and is summarized in the WCJ\u2019s Decision at Finding of Fact 11.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fClaimant had not been sexually assaulted and Claimant\u2019s text message to Coworker\nin which Claimant used the term \u201clol.\u201d (Id.) EEO Director \u201cfelt this was strong\nevidence because Claimant\u201d first alleged having been raped \u201cbut then immediately\ntook it back\u201d during the interview with Trooper. (Id.) EEO Director also took a\nstatement from Officer, which \u201cconfirm[ed] that the first time Claimant learned that\n[Coworker] was married was during the course of [the] conversation with [Officer]\nwhere [Claimant] confided in [Officer] that [Claimant] did not have consensual\nintercourse with [Coworker].\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(e).) During EEO Director\u2019s interview with\nClaimant, Claimant \u201cconfirmed that Claimant was at first in denial that this was a\nsexual assault.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(f).) As to why Claimant denied that it was so to Trooper,\nClaimant stated that she \u201cfeared retaliation and was terrified.\u201d (Id.) During the\ninterview with Claimant, EEO Director explained that Claimant stated that she \u201ctold\n[Coworker] numerous times that she did not want to have sex with [Coworker].\u201d\n(Id. \u00b6 11(d).) EEO Director \u201ccould not reach any conclusions as to whether any\nconsensual sex occurred.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 11(f).)\n\n      D.    The WCJ\u2019s Decision\n      The WCJ reviewed the evidence and testimony submitted by the parties and\nmade factual findings and credibility determinations. First, the WCJ reviewed the\ntext messages between Claimant and Coworker. (Id. \u00b6 12; see R.R. at 213a-25a.)\nBased on the review, the WCJ found that \u201c[i]t is not possible to accurately ascribe\nsentiment or emotion to texts\u201d and \u201cthat the texts document that Claimant refused\n[Coworker\u2019s] advancements and overtures to have sex prior\u201d to the May 20, 2018\nincident. (Id. \u00b6 12.) Further, the WCJ found that these text messages showed that,\nafter the incident, \u201cClaimant confronted [Coworker]\u201d and explained that Claimant\nwas affected by the incident and that Claimant \u201ccould not ignore what had\n\n\n                                           12\n\fhappened.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ found that \u201c[t]hese texts [confronting Coworker] were\nsent before Claimant was told that [Coworker] was married.\u201d (Id.)\n      The WCJ also reviewed the videotape of Trooper\u2019s interview of Claimant.\n(Id. \u00b6 13.) The WCJ found that \u201ca review of the videotape in its entirety leaves no\nquestion that Claimant was the victim of a rape at work on May 20, 2018.\u201d (Id.)\nThe WCJ described that, during the interview with Trooper, Claimant is \u201cclearly[,]\nvisibly upset and cries uncontrollably at times when Trooper leaves the room.\u201d (Id.)\n\u201cAlthough Trooper [] encourages Claimant that this incident was more of a\nconsensual intercourse,\u201d the WCJ found that \u201cthe record is devoid of consent.\u201d (Id.)\nThe WCJ found \u201cit significant that Claimant was too upset to write a statement.\u201d\n(Id.) Further, the WCJ found Trooper\u2019s written question and answer approach did\nnot amount to \u201ca statement [by Claimant] but a series of questions which\npredetermine the answer in a yes or no fashion.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ characterized\nTrooper\u2019s approach as using \u201conly leading questions which when answered deny a\nrape.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ found Trooper\u2019s tactics \u201cmake it seem[] that Claimant only\ngot upset when she learned that [Coworker] was married[,]\u201d but \u201c[t]he videotape\ndocuments Claimant\u2019s lack of comfort with being compelled to answer yes or no and\nher hesitation in giving the answers.\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ concluded that\n\u201c[t]he videotape supports Claimant\u2019s testimony that she was raped at work on May\n20, 201[8].\u201d (Id.)\n      Turning to credibility determinations, the WCJ determined Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony was credible and persuasive. (Id. \u00b6 14.) The WCJ explained \u201cClaimant\u2019s\ncomposure and demeanor during [] live testimony and [the WCJ\u2019s] observation of\nthe videotape interview\u201d with Trooper to be significant in making this credibility\ndetermination. (Id.) The WCJ found that Claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent in\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthat Claimant \u201cnever gave her consent to be penetrated by\u201d Coworker, told\nCoworker no, and rebuffed Coworker\u2019s advancements before the incident. (Id.)\nFurther, the WCJ noted that Claimant \u201cnever had any difficulty performing her job\nduties\u201d and \u201cnever sought any mental health treatment or experienced any mental\nhealth illness prior to\u201d the incident. (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ accepted Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony as fact. (Id.)\n      Regarding Dr. Wiley\u2019s and Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found \u201cthat the\ntestimony of Dr. Wiley was more credible and persuasive than the testimony of Dr.\nBora.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 15.) The WCJ explained that \u201cDr. Wiley\u2019s testimony is more credible\nbecause it is consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony[,] which has been\naccepted as fact. As Claimant\u2019s treating psychologist, [Dr. Wiley] was more familiar\nwith the rape, Claimant\u2019s report of the rape, her treatment and her devolution into a\ncrisis in August of 2018.\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ accepted Dr. Wiley\u2019s\ntestimony in its entirety as fact. (Id.)\n      Conversely, the WCJ deemed Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony to be \u201cnot credible or\npersuasive because [Dr. Bora] believed Claimant to have mental health issues in the\npast because of one note in her family doctor\u2019s records from December 7, 2016,\u201d\ndespite the fact that \u201c[t]here is no other indication that Claimant sought mental health\ntreatment or had a mental health illness.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 16.) Further, the WCJ noted that\nDr. Bora believed that Claimant was not raped \u201cbecause[,] in [Dr. Bora\u2019s] opinion,\nClaimant flirted with\u201d Coworker and also because Claimant \u201chad a prior sexual\nrelationship with\u201d Coworker. (Id.) With respect to Claimant\u2019s perception changing\nafter discovering that Coworker was married, the WCJ found that Dr. Bora\n\u201ccompletely misstates the timeline of Claimant\u2019s distress over her rape which was\nimmediate.\u201d (Id.) The WCJ explained Dr. Bora\u2019s misunderstanding of the timeline,\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fas \u201cClaimant only found out [Coworker] was married after Officer asked why\nClaimant was sad\u201d and Claimant told Officer about the incident. (Id. (emphasis\nadded).) Finally, the WCJ found that Dr. Bora \u201clacks credibility because he admits\nthat if Claimant were a private patient, he would not question whether or not she had\nbeen sexually assaulted but would focus on treatment[,] assuming the history to be\ntrue.\u201d (Id.) Finding Dr. Bora\u2019s opinions to be \u201cbiased and without competent factual\nfoundation,\u201d the WCJ rejected Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony in its entirety. (Id.)\n      As for Trooper\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found that \u201cTrooper [] testified\naccurately as to how he conducted the interview with Claimant[]\u201d but did \u201cnot find\n[Trooper\u2019s] conclusions that the assault on Claimant was consensual sexual\nintercourse credible or persuasive.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 18.) Finding that Claimant never\nconsented but specifically said \u201cno,\u201d the WCJ added that the facts that Claimant\n\u201cadmits she froze\u201d and that she \u201cshould have fought [Coworker] off more . . . do not\nmake the forced intercourse consensual.\u201d (Id.) As for Trooper\u2019s interview with\nClaimant, the WCJ found the questions to be leading in nature because \u201call of the\nquestions he wrote for Claimant that p[ur]port to be \u2018her\u2019 statement[] presuppose an\nanswer compelling a conclusion that the sex was consensual, and [that] Claimant\nwas upset\u201d because she discovered that Coworker was married. (Id.) The WCJ\nexplained that Trooper\u2019s \u201creasoning does not support that the rape did not occur[]\u201d\nand that Trooper\u2019s reliance on a lack of \u201cviolence\u201d is in error where there was no\nconsent. (Id.)\n      Turning to EEO Director\u2019s testimony, the WCJ found the testimony not\ncredible or persuasive. The WCJ noted that EEO Director \u201crelied heavily on the\ninterview of Claimant by Trooper [] and the text messages.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 21.) Given that\nthe WCJ \u201chas found both not credible to defeat Claimant\u2019s\u201d competent and\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fpersuasive testimony concerning the incident, the WCJ determined that EEO\nDirector\u2019s \u201cinvestigation and testimony [were] not based on a competent factual\nfoundation and [] rejected\u201d them. (Id.)\n       Finally, despite that Officer did not provide testimony in this matter, the WCJ\nstated that she found Officer\u2019s testimony consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony and\naccepted it as fact. (Id. \u00b6 17.) Further, in discussing Claimant\u2019s credibility, the WCJ\nfound that \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony is also supported by the testimony of Officer[].\u201d\n(Id. \u00b6 14.)\n       Accordingly, the WCJ found that \u201c[o]n May 20, 2018, Claimant was raped in\nthe control bubble of the [RHU] by [Coworker.]\u201d (Id. \u00b6 22.) The WCJ explained\nthat the burden of proof in this \u201cmental/mental case\u201d requires \u201cproof of an abnormal\nworking condition\u201d and found that \u201c[f]orced sexual intercourse without consent is a\nrape[]\u201d and that \u201c[r]ape is never a normal working condition.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 23.) The WCJ\nfound that the incident caused Claimant to sustain a psychological injury in the form\nof post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, and that this injury was \u201cnot\na subjective reaction to a normal working condition[]\u201d but has been \u201cobjectively\nverified by Dr. Wiley.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; WCJ\u2019s Conclusions of Law (COL) \u00b6 2.) As\na result, the WCJ concluded, \u201cClaimant became totally disabled effective August 10,\n2018.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 25; COL \u00b6 3.) Employer appealed the WCJ\u2019s Decision to the Board.\n\n       E.       The Board\u2019s Opinion11\n       On appeal to the Board, Employer argued that:                  (1) \u201cthe WCJ lacked\njurisdiction to decide whether Claimant was raped and[,] in doing so[,] violated the\ncriminal due process rights of [Coworker]\u201d; (2) the WCJ\u2019s Decision was not\nsupported by substantial, competent evidence; (3) the WCJ capriciously disregarded\n\n       11\n            The Board\u2019s Opinion is found at pages 47a through 60a of the Reproduced Record.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fevidence; and (4) the WCJ \u201cerroneously found Claimant\u2019s testimony was\ncorroborated by Officer[.]\u201d (Board Opinion (Op.) at 2.)\n      First, the Board concluded that Claimant satisfied the \u201cburden of proving by\nobjective evidence that [Claimant] sustained a psych[ological] injury and that such\ninjury was other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions.\u201d (Id. at\n11.) The Board explained that Claimant provided proof that she suffered from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder through her \u201ccredited\ntestimony as to an actual event and the credited testimony of her treating\npsychologist[,] Dr. Wiley.\u201d (Id.) Because \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony was not limited to\n[a] belief of subjective, abnormal conditions[] but rather included [Claimant\u2019s own]\ndescription . . . of an actual, specific event[,]\u201d the question of credibility was solely\nfor the WCJ to make within her discretion. (Id.) Given that the WCJ found that\n\u201cClaimant was physically assaulted causing her to sustain a psychological injury[,]\u201d\nthe Board determined that the credited testimonies of Claimant and Dr. Wiley\n\u201cconstitute[d] substantial, competent evidence [that] Claimant sustained work-\nrelated\u201d injuries rendering Claimant \u201ctotally disabled ongoing from August 10,\n2018.\u201d (Id.) The Board added that the fact that \u201cClaimant provided a signed\nstatement to the . . . State Police denying rape or sexual assault does not diminish\nthe substantial, competent evidence supporting the WCJ\u2019s Decision.\u201d (Id.) Because\nClaimant\u2019s testimony regarding the event was found credible, and given that the\nmedical evidence from Dr. Wiley \u201cunequivocally established that the abnormal\nworking conditions caused psych[ological] injuries,\u201d the Board concluded that \u201cthe\nWCJ did not err in finding a compensable injury.\u201d (Id. at 12.)\n      Turning to Employer\u2019s contention that \u201cthe WCJ\u2019s finding that Claimant was\nphysically assaulted or made reference to the word \u2018rape\u2019 is [] tantamount to a\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fcriminal conviction[,]\u201d the Board explained that while \u201ca determination as to\nwhether the crimes of sexual assault or rape occurred were outside [the WCJ\u2019s]\nspecific jurisdiction, the WCJ was well within her purview to determine whether\nClaimant was subjected to abnormal working conditions[.]\u201d (Id. (emphasis added).)\nThe Board stated that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act12 (Act) \u201cis applicable to all\ninjuries occurring within Pennsylvania[.]\u201d (Id.) Accordingly, the Board explained,\n\u201c[a] WCJ may analyze evidence concerning incidents on the job leading to disability,\neven if that evidence implicates criminal conduct[,]\u201d comparing the WCJ\u2019s finding\nhere to those in Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v.

The Board further\nemphasized that its \u201caffirmance of the WCJ\u2019s findings of an abnormal working\ncondition based on substantial, competent evidence does not relate to or overlap with\nthe determination of whether a criminal act did or did not occur.\u201d (Id. at 13 n.3.)\n      The Board then addressed Employer\u2019s position that August 10, 2018, was not\nthe proper date of disability because Dr. Wiley did not document that Claimant\nshould not be working until September 4, 2018. The Board explained that \u201cthe\nrecord indicates that August 10, 2018[,] was the date Claimant ceased working due\nto her ongoing symptoms of depression and anxiety.\u201d (Id.) \u201cBecause the WCJ\n\n\n      12\n           Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.4, 2501-2710.\n\n\n                                               18\n\fcredited Claimant\u2019s testimony in that regard, [the Board] decline[d] to disturb that\ndate on appeal[]\u201d as those \u201ccredibility determinations were not made arbitrarily and\ncapriciously and [the WCJ\u2019s] findings are supported by substantial evidence[.]\u201d (Id.\n(citations omitted).)\n       Finally, the Board turned to Employer\u2019s argument that \u201cthe WCJ erred by\nfinding Claimant\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Officer as that testimony is absent\nfrom the record.\u201d (Id.) Agreeing that Officer\u2019s testimony was not in the record, the\nBoard nonetheless concluded that the WCJ\u2019s error in so stating was \u201charmless as this\nabsent testimony was explicitly found to be consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony,\nwhich is part of the record and was found credible.\u201d (Id. at 13-14 (citing Benson v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Comp.

Whether the WCJ had authority to find that the May 20, 2018 incident\n           occurred as Claimant testified.\n              1.     Parties\u2019 Arguments\n       Employer argues that the WCJ erred in denying its Motion to Dismiss the\nClaim Petition and granting the Claim Petition because the WCJ lacked the authority\nto determine that the May 20, 2018 work incident occurred and that, in doing so,\nacted outside of the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Employer posits that the General Assembly\n\u201cvested the power to prosecute criminal matters in the Attorney General\u201d and district\n\n       13\n         Two of the Board\u2019s Commissioners concurred in the result only.\n       14\n          Our scope of review in workers\u2019 compensation matters \u201cis limited to determining\nwhether constitutional rights have been violated, whether an error of law has been committed[,]\nand whether all necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Archer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2201802\"><a href=\"/opinion/2201802/archer-v-wcab-general-motors/\">587\nA.2d at 903</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n                                              19\n\fattorneys and that the statute vesting such authority \u201cis unambiguous and should be\nread as a restriction on any other party acting to investigate criminal offenses\u201d under\nthe plain meaning of the statute\u2019s language. (Employer\u2019s Brief (Br.) at 31 (citing\nSection 206 of the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-206).15) Because\nthe Act does not give a WCJ any authority to investigate or determine whether a\ncrime was committed and only confers prosecution powers to district attorneys for\npurposes of insurance fraud, Employer asserts, the WCJ was without authority to\ndetermine that Coworker raped Claimant. (Id. at 32.) Employer posits that the Board\n\u201cadmit[ted] that the WCJ made a determination that a criminal act did occur \u2013\nsomething that [it] also admit[ted] is outside [the WCJ\u2019s or Board\u2019s] jurisdiction.\u201d\n(Id. at 33.)\n       Additionally, Employer argues that the WCJ violated Coworker\u2019s due process\nrights by determining that Coworker had raped Claimant.

Employer argues that \u201c[t]his violation of [Coworker\u2019s] due process\nrights is akin to vigilante justice wherein [Coworker] has been branded a rapist by\nsomeone not authorized or capable to do so, and this branding shall remain in\n[Coworker\u2019s] file for the remainder of [Coworker\u2019s] career.\u201d (Id. at 36.)\n\n\n       15\n            Act of October 15, 1980, P.L. 950, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 732-101 \u2013 732-506.\n\n\n                                               20\n\f       Claimant responds, arguing that the WCJ acted within her jurisdiction.\nClaimant asserts that a WCJ is \u201cempowered to find that an incident or circumstances\non the job, if it rises to the level of abnormal working conditions, can cause\npsychological injuries.\u201d (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 12 (citing Martin v.

To provide compensation to injured workers, \u201ca WCJ and the Board are\nauthorized by the Act to determine whether or not an employee who alleges [the\nemployee] was injured during the course of [their] employment is entitled to\ncompensation.\u201d Heath v.

In doing so, a WCJ is required to make credibility and\nevidentiary determinations, to make findings as to the facts underlying the matter,\nand to determine whether a claimant has met the burden of proving entitlement to\ncompensation, and with regard to these findings and determinations, \u201cthe WCJ is the\nultimate finder of fact and the exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary\nweight.\u201d Thompson v.

We disagree. The Act extends to\n\u201call injuries occurring within this Commonwealth[,]\u201d including those where the\nevidence implicates criminal conduct. 77 P.S. \u00a7 1.\n      Contrary to Employer\u2019s arguments, courts have found abnormal working\nconditions and granted benefits in other instances where the evidence implicated\ncriminal conduct. For instance, in RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v.\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Hopton), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4962916\"><a href=\"/opinion/5142783/rag-cyprus-emerald-resources-lp-v-workers-compensation-appeal-board/\">912 A.2d 1278</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 2007), the\nclaimant alleged to have been the victim of sexual harassment by the claimant\u2019s\nsupervisor.

There was no indication that this\nlimited the WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction to decide whether the injury occurred and\nwas compensable.\n      Similarly, in Kochanowicz, the claimant alleged to have been the victim of an\narmed robbery while working at the employer\u2019s retail store. The claimant averred\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fthat the robbery caused him post-traumatic stress disorder. After considering that\nthe claimant had received workplace training for such an incident, we nonetheless\nupheld the WCJ\u2019s finding that the robbery constituted abnormal working conditions\ngiven that the claimant had not experienced workplace violence in his 30-year\nemployment. Kochanowicz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4969505\"><a href=\"/opinion/5148434/pa-liquor-control-board-v-workers-compensation-appeal-board/\">108 A.3d at 934</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Again, there was no impediment to\nthe WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction. Likewise, in Philadelphia Electric Co. v.\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Miller), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4950148\"><a href=\"/opinion/5131022/philadelphia-electric-co-v-workmens-compensation-appeal-board/\">643 A.2d 1186</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.

The claimant further averred that the dog\u2019s owner then threatened to kill\nthe claimant and proceeded to then chase the claimant with a gun. We determined\nthat this conduct constituted an abnormal working condition that caused the claimant\npsychological injuries.\n      Finally, in Donovan v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Academy\nMedical Realty), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2086491\"><a href=\"/opinion/2086491/donovan-v-wcab-academy-med-realty/\">739 A.2d 1156</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.

Nonetheless,\nthe WCJs and the Board were within their purview to determine that a compensable\ninjury resulted from conduct that occurred in the course of the claimants\u2019\nemployment. These cases demonstrate that although the evidence may implicate\ncriminal conduct, this does not limit the WCJ\u2019s or the Board\u2019s authority and\njurisdiction to determine that a compensable, work-related injury occurred.\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      While Employer argues that \u201cthe Act does not give a WCJ jurisdiction over\ncriminal matters to make findings of criminal wrongdoing and to [grant or] suspend\nbenefits based thereon[,]\u201d that is not what occurred. See, e.g., Brehm v. Workers\u2019\nComp. Appeal Bd. (Hygienic Sanitation Co.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2386217\"><a href=\"/opinion/2386217/brehm-v-workerscompensation-appeal-bd/\">782 A.2d 1077</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1087 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2001) (Friedman, J., dissenting). As the Board astutely stated:\n\n      We emphasize that our affirmance of the WCJ\u2019s finding of an abnormal\n      working condition based on substantial, competent evidence does not\n      relate to or overlap with the determination of whether a criminal act did\n      or did not occur . . . . We acknowledge that the authority to prosecute\n      the crimes of sexual assault and rape rests with the criminal justice\n      system alone, which applies differing procedural rules and burdens of\n      proof.\n\n(Board\u2019s Op. at 13 n.3.) The WCJ\u2019s findings in this case did not constitute a legal\ndetermination that Coworker criminally raped or sexually assaulted Claimant. As\nEmployer recognizes, there has been no criminal process in this matter, and\nCoworker \u201chere does not face criminal prosecution or confinement[.]\u201d (Employer\u2019s\nBr. at 35.) This was an administrative proceeding, and the WCJ did not apply the\nelements of the statutory provisions criminalizing rape and sexual assault or the very\nhigh standard of proof employed in criminal matters.\n      Here, the WCJ made credibility determinations, and found there was\nsubstantial evidence that Claimant was subjected to nonconsensual sexual\nintercourse at work, that this was an abnormal working condition, and that she\nsustained a resulting psychological injury which was not a subjective reaction to a\nnormal working condition. This was within the WCJ\u2019s authority. That the WCJ also\nopined that such conduct amounted to rape does not render the WCJ\u2019s findings in\nerror or diminish the WCJ\u2019s authority or jurisdiction. As the Board recognized, \u201ca\ndetermination of whether a criminal act did or did not occur\u201d was outside of the\n\n                                         26\n\fBoard\u2019s or the WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction. (Employer\u2019s Br. at 33 (citing Board Op. at 13\nn.3).) The Board correctly emphasized that the WCJ\u2019s findings of fact in these\nmatters do not amount to a determination as to any criminal liability stemming from\nthe conduct at issue. (See Board\u2019s Op. at 13 n.3.)\n      Because Coworker is not a party, this is not a criminal proceeding, and there\nis no risk of an adverse adjudication as to Coworker, we also disagree that the WCJ\u2019s\nDecision implicates Coworker\u2019s due process rights or the Confrontation Clause.\nEmployer cites no authority to support such a proposition.            Indeed, that the\nConfrontation Clause concerns the rights of criminal defendants \u201c[i]n . . . criminal\nprosecutions[]\u201d belies that position. U.S. CONST. amend. VI.\n      Finally, we note that adopting Employer\u2019s position would be contrary to the\npurpose of the Act, which ensures that injured employees have a process available\nto seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Such a decision would render heinous\nconduct in the workplace that causes injury to go unchecked and would prevent\nemployees injured on the job by such conduct from seeking compensation and\nredress of injury. This is especially true in light of the fact that the Act \u201creplace[d]\ntraditional common law rights and remedies[]\u201d in regard to an employee\u2019s recovery\nfor work-related injury against an employer. East v. Workers\u2019 Comp.

Cmwlth. 2003). Thus, we agree\nwith Claimant that any potential criminal liability for conduct that is at issue in a\nworkers\u2019 compensation matter does not negate a WCJ\u2019s jurisdiction and authority.\nAccordingly, the WCJ and the Board did not err on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      B.       Whether the Board erred in holding that corroboration was not\n               necessary to prove that an abnormal working condition occurred.\n               1.       Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer argues that the WCJ and the Board erred in holding that \u201cit is not\nnecessary to determine if an actual rape or sexual assault occurred because all\nClaimant had to do was demonstrate abnormal working conditions and an \u2018actual\nevent\u2019 that caused [Claimant\u2019s] alleged injuries.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 39.) Employer\nmaintains that \u201ccorroboration was necessary[]\u201d to show that the \u201csexual act . . . [was]\nunwanted\u201d and that the Board erred in not so requiring. (Id. at 40.) Employer likens\nthe WCJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s determinations to \u201csupport the idea that a claimant can\nallege that aliens came down and injured her at work\u201d and that \u201conly [the] claimant\u2019s\ntestimony that it happened would be required to sustain a compensable claim.\u201d (Id.\nat 41-42.)\n      In response, Claimant argues that corroborative evidence was not required in\nthis matter.        Claimant maintains that, in certain circumstances, corroborative\nevidence is not required to prove that an event constituting an abnormal working\ncondition occurred. (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 20 (citing Archer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2201802\"><a href=\"/opinion/2201802/archer-v-wcab-general-motors/\">587 A.2d at 901</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).)\nClaimant asserts that \u201c[c]orroborative evidence is required to support the claimant\u2019s\ndescription of a general abnormal working environment that caused an injury;\nhowever, where a claimant testifies about actual events, corroborative evidence is\nnot required.\u201d (Id. at 18 (citing Donovan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2086491\"><a href=\"/opinion/2086491/donovan-v-wcab-academy-med-realty/\">739 A.2d at 1156</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).)

Analysis\n      As explained above, the claimant in workers\u2019 compensation matters alleging\na mental/mental injury carries the burden of proving that her injury was not a\n\n                                             28\n\fsubjective reaction to normal working conditions.

Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer argues that the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious and\nnot based on competent evidence. Employer asserts that the Board \u201cdid not mention\nthe conflicting evidence . . . in this case or the fact that the WCJ did not address the\nconflicting evidence but merely ignored [the] same.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Br. at 40.) First,\nEmployer submits that the WCJ erred in finding Dr. Wiley to be more credible than\nDr. Bora, alleging that Dr. Wiley\u2019s testimony was contradictory to Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony and further \u201cdemonstrate[d] that Dr. Wiley was a paid puppet being\ndirected in his treatment of Claimant by [Claimant\u2019s attorney.]\u201d (Id. at 43.) Second,\nEmployer posits that the WCJ ignored contradictory evidence as to Claimant\u2019s\nalleged injuries and Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony and opinions. (Id. at 44-45.) Third,\nEmployer asserts that the WCJ misstated Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony with respect to his\nreliance on Coworker\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship. (Id. at 45 n.7.)\n      Finally, Employer asserts that the WCJ erred in ignoring substantial evidence\nthat the sexual intercourse was consensual. In addition to Claimant\u2019s statements to\nthe State Police that Claimant was not raped or sexually assaulted, Employer argues\nthat \u201c[t]he WCJ failed to accord proper weight to the prior sexual relationship\nbetween Claimant and [Coworker], as well as the sexual nature of [C]laimant\u2019s text[\nmessage]s to [Coworker] before and on May 20, 2018.\u201d (Id. at 41.) Moreover,\n\n\n                                          31\n\fEmployer asserts that substantial evidence shows \u201c[C]laimant only became upset\nabout this alleged interaction/incident and alleged that a rape/sexual assault took\nplace once she found out that [Coworker] was married and that she could not pursue\na relationship with [Coworker].\u201d (Id. at 46-47.) Employer maintains that the WCJ\u2019s\nfinding that Claimant was upset immediately after the incident was in error because:\nClaimant continued to work after the incident \u201cwithout any issues\u201d; Claimant did\nnot speak with anyone about the incident on May 20, 2018; Claimant used the term\n\u201clol\u201d when Claimant texted Coworker the following day after the incident; and the\nother text messages from Claimant to Coworker that \u201ctend to show a woman seeking\nout the attention of a man who she had a flirtatious relationship with and who she\nlater discovers is married.\u201d (Id. at 47.) Moreover, Employer asserts that the WCJ\nignored Claimant\u2019s \u201csigned statement\u201d given to the State Police that the incident was\nnot rape or sexual assault and that Claimant was more upset about learning that\nCoworker was married. (Id. at 48-49.) Employer maintains that Claimant only\nalleged that a rape or sexual assault occurred after Officer opined that Claimant had\nbeen raped and, moreover, that the evidence of record does not support that Claimant\nwas sexually assaulted or raped. (Id. at 50.)\n      Claimant responds that the Board properly affirmed the WCJ\u2019s findings\nbecause Claimant proved with objective evidence that Claimant\u2019s psychological\ninjury resulted from abnormal working conditions. Claimant argues that she proved\nthat the abnormal working condition in this case was the \u201cnon-consensual sexual\nintercourse forced upon her by [Coworker],\u201d and that Employer\u2019s arguments \u201care\nlittle more than meritless attacks on the WCJ\u2019s credibility determinations, which are\nwell-reasoned and supported by substantial evidence of record.\u201d (Claimant\u2019s Br. at\n21.) Claimant maintains that the WCJ thoroughly explained the WCJ\u2019s credibility\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fdeterminations and that Employer\u2019s position \u201cattempts to manipulate the evidence\nand overcome a nuanced and clearly well-reasoned and supported decision by the\nWCJ[.]\u201d (Id. at 25.)\n      In its Reply Brief, Employer maintains that the evidence in this matter\n\u201creflects\u201d that: (1) \u201cClaimant clearly lied ([e]ither to [Trooper] or under oath in this\nproceeding)\u201d; (2) \u201cClaimant wanted a relationship with [Coworker]\u201d; (3) \u201cClaimant\nonly became upset when she realized [Coworker] was married\u201d; (4) \u201cClaimant never\nsought treatment until she obtained an attorney\u201d; and (5) \u201cClaimant\u2019s expert was\ntainted.\u201d (Employer\u2019s Reply Br. at 4.)\n\n             2.

Our review of Dr. Bora\u2019s testimony is consistent with this finding. After\nbeing asked whether Dr. Bora \u201cbelieved that some sort of rape or sexual assault\noccurred on May 20[], 2018[,]\u201d Dr. Bora testified: \u201cBased on the records that I\nreviewed, it\u2019s not clear to me that a rape occurred.

Given the consistency between this testimony and the\nWCJ\u2019s finding, we disagree that the WCJ mischaracterized Dr. Bora\u2019s reliance on\nCoworker and Claimant\u2019s prior relationship.\n      Employer last argues that the WCJ\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious\nbecause the WCJ ignored evidence showing that the sexual intercourse was\nconsensual. We disagree. A review of the WCJ\u2019s findings show that the WCJ\ncomplied with the reasoned decision requirements by \u201cadequately explain[ing] the\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\freasons for rejecting or discrediting competent evidence.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. With\nregard to the text messages that Claimant sent to Coworker after the May 20, 2018\nincident that used the term \u201clol,\u201d the WCJ found that it was \u201cnot possible to\naccurately ascribe sentiment or emotion to texts[,]\u201d but that Claimant sent the texts\nto \u201cconfront[ Coworker] by [] telling [Coworker] that she was upset over\u201d the\nincident, that Claimant\u2019s \u201cappetite was affected[,]\u201d \u201cthat she could not ignore what\nhad happened[,]\u201d and that Claimant \u201cfelt used and violated.\u201d (FOF \u00b6 12.) The WCJ\nalso found that \u201c[t]hese texts were sent before Claimant was told that [Coworker]\nwas married.\u201d (Id.) Next, with respect to the \u201csigned statement\u201d that Claimant gave\nto the State Police, the WCJ reviewed the videotape of Claimant\u2019s interview with\nTrooper and Trooper\u2019s testimony and determined that Trooper\u2019s conclusions that\nClaimant consented to the sexual intercourse and his interview and investigation\napproach were not reliable. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18.) The WCJ explained that Trooper\u2019s\ndecision to write questions that \u201cpresuppose an answer compelling a conclusion that\nthe sex was consensual\u201d amounted to a leading approach and that the resulting\ndocument did not constitute Claimant\u2019s \u201cstatement.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 18.) The WCJ also\ndisagreed with Trooper\u2019s opinion that Claimant was only upset because she found\nout that Coworker was married. (Id.) Accordingly, the WCJ rejected Trooper\u2019s\nconclusions as to consent as unreliable and also did not credit Claimant\u2019s\n\u201cstatement\u201d due to the leading nature of the questions that Trooper wrote for\nClaimant.

These findings show that the WCJ did not \u201cdeliberate[ly] and\nbaseless[ly] disregard . . . apparently trustworthy evidence.\u201d Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351572\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351572/williams-v-wcab-usx-corp/\">862 A.2d at\n144</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rather, the WCJ adequately explained the reasons for rejecting this evidence.\nWhile Employer asks this Court to instead determine that this evidence shows that\nthe sexual intercourse was consensual, such an evidentiary determination is within\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fthe discretion of the WCJ in these matters.

Because\nthe WCJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and complied with the\nreasoned decision requirements, the WCJ\u2019s findings were not arbitrary or capricious.\n\n      D.    Whether the WCJ\u2019s crediting of Officer\u2019s testimony as reliable and\n      consistent with Claimant\u2019s testimony constituted reversible error.\n\n             1.    Parties\u2019 Arguments\n      Employer last argues that the WCJ erred in finding Officer\u2019s testimony to be\ncredible because Officer did not testify in this matter. Because the WCJ found\nOfficer\u2019s testimony to be credible and accepted it as fact, Employer maintains that\nthe WCJ\u2019s credibility determination as to Claimant constituted reversible error, as\nthe WCJ relied in part on the consistency between Officer\u2019s and Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony.\n      Claimant acknowledges that the WCJ\u2019s finding that Officer\u2019s testimony was\ncredible was in error but asserts that this error was harmless because any statements\nalleged to have been made by Officer were merely cumulative of Claimant\u2019s\ntestimony and established through other evidence of record. (Claimant\u2019s Br. at 23.)\n\n\n             2.    Analysis\n      This Court has held that a WCJ\u2019s error is harmless where \u201cother competent\nevidence, standing alone, exists in the record to support the [WCJ\u2019s] findings.\u201d\nNabisco, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Cummings), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4950639\"><a href=\"/opinion/5131450/nabisco-inc-v-workmens-compensation-appeal-board/\">651 A.2d 716</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718-19\n(Pa. Cmwlth. 1994). In Nabisco, the WCJ erred by admitting hearsay evidence that\nsupported the finding that the claimant was injured while in the course of\nemployment. We held that the error was harmless because the WCJ also relied on\nthe testimony of other witnesses to support the WCJ\u2019s findings. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4950639\"><a href=\"/opinion/5131450/nabisco-inc-v-workmens-compensation-appeal-board/\">Id. at 719</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n                                         39\n\f      Here, the WCJ\u2019s crediting of Officer\u2019s testimony was harmless error. While\nOfficer did not offer any testimony, the WCJ found that \u201c[t]he testimony of Officer\n[] has been reviewed and is found credible and persuasive.[19] [Officer\u2019s] testimony\nis consistent with Claimant\u2019s credible testimony and is accepted as fact.\u201d (FOF\n\u00b6 17.) Further, the WCJ found that \u201cClaimant\u2019s testimony is also support[ed] by the\ntestimony of Officer [].\u201d (Id. \u00b6 14.) However, the WCJ did not state what\nevidentiary findings were made based on Officer\u2019s testimony. With regard to using\nOfficer\u2019s testimony to support Claimant\u2019s testimony, the WCJ also relied on\nClaimant\u2019s demeanor during live testimony, Claimant\u2019s deposition testimony, and\nthe videotape interview with Trooper. Such evidence is more than sufficient for a\nWCJ\u2019s credibility determination, given that \u201ca WCJ may satisfy the reasoned\ndecision requirements by basing a credibility determination on a witness\u2019s demeanor\nduring live testimony.\u201d Daniels, 828 A.2d at 1052-53. Moreover, there is nothing\nto suggest that the WCJ would not have made the same credibility determination as\nto Claimant without Officer\u2019s \u201ctestimony.\u201d Further, Claimant\u2019s testimony regarding\nthe conversation with Officer is also supported by the testimony of Employer\u2019s own\nwitness, EEO Director. (Id. \u00b6 11(d).) Accordingly, because \u201cother competent\nevidence, standing alone, exists to support the [WCJ\u2019s] findings,\u201d Nabisco Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4950639\"><a href=\"/opinion/5131450/nabisco-inc-v-workmens-compensation-appeal-board/\">651\nA.2d at 718-19,</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> any error of the WCJ in this matter was harmless.\n\n   III.    CONCLUSION\n      In sum: (1) the WCJ had the authority and jurisdiction to determine that\nabnormal working conditions caused Claimant\u2019s psychological injuries, regardless\nof whether the evidence implicates criminal conduct; (2) because Claimant credibly\n\n      19\n          After review, it appears that the WCJ misunderstood EEO Director\u2019s notes of the\ninterview with Officer to be Officer\u2019s testimony in this matter.\n\n\n                                           40\n\ftestified to actual events, corroboration was not necessary to prove that the abnormal\nworking conditions existed; (3) the WCJ\u2019s findings were not arbitrary and capricious\nand were supported by substantial evidence of record; and (4) the WCJ\u2019s crediting\nof Officer\u2019s testimony constituted harmless error.

Docket No. 1:17-cv-23609-JB\n                   ____________________\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 2 of 24\n\n\n\n\n2                      Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\nBefore WILSON, ROSENBAUM, and HULL, Circuit Judges.\nWILSON, Circuit Judge:\n       Maria Teresa Pupo appeals the district court\u2019s order affirm-\ning the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration\u2019s\n(Commissioner) denial of her application for supplemental security\nincome (SSI). Pupo raises five issues on appeal: (1) the administra-\ntive law judge (ALJ) erred by not considering whether to apply a\nhigher age category, (2) the Appeals Council erred by not consid-\nering additional medical evidence she submitted, (3) the ALJ erred\nin assessing her residual functional capacity (RFC), (4) the ALJ\nerred in not giving controlling weight to her treating doctor and\npsychiatrist, and (5) the ALJ erred in finding her mental impair-\nments did not meet a listed impairment. We find that the Com-\nmissioner\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence for\ntwo reasons. First, the ALJ erred by not addressing one of Pupo\u2019s\nmedical diagnoses, her incontinence, when assessing her RFC. Sec-\nond, the Appeals Council erred by not considering the new medical\nevidence submitted by Pupo following the ALJ\u2019s denial of her SSI\nclaim. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision affirm-\ning the ALJ\u2019s decision and remand to the Commissioner to reeval-\nuate Pupo\u2019s claim consistent with this opinion.\n                         BACKGROUND\n      Before turning to the facts of the case, here is a brief over-\nview of the process for obtaining social security benefits. The\nclaimant applies in writing to the Social Security Administration\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 3 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                        3\n\n(SSA) and if the SSA denies the application, the claimant has sixty\ndays to seek reconsideration. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b)(1). If the SSA\ndenies reconsideration, the claimant can request a hearing before\nan ALJ.\n      At the hearing, the ALJ performs a five-step analysis in de-\ntermining if the applicant is disabled. The steps are as follows:\n   1. At Step One, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity. If the claimant is en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity, then the claimant is not\n      disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i).\n   2. At Step Two, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      a severe impairment. A claimant who does not have a se-\n      vere impairment is not disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n   3. At Step Three, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      an impairment that meets or equals a listed impairment. A\n      claimant who meets or equals a listed impairment is disa-\n      bled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii).\n   4. At Step Four, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      any impairments that prevent her from returning to her past\n      relevant work. If the claimant has a severe impairment that\n      does not equal or meet the severity of the listed impairment,\n      the ALJ proceeds to Step Four and assesses the claimant\u2019s\n      RFC. If the claimant can return to her past or relevant work,\n      then she is not disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 4 of 24\n\n\n\n\n4                      Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\n    5. At Step Five, the ALJ determines whether the claimant\u2019s im-\n       pairment prevents her from doing any other work. If the\n       claimant can adjust to other work, she is not disabled, but if\n       she cannot adjust, she is disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v).\n       The claimant may also obtain judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision in a United States district court by commencing a civil ac-\ntion within sixty days of notice of the decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).\n       Pupo first applied for SSI in June 2011, alleging that she was\nunable to work due to depression, body tremors, and high blood\npressure. Her initial application was denied, but, in June 2015, her\ncase was remanded by the district court for further proceedings\npursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Appeals Coun-\ncil then vacated the Commissioner\u2019s final decision and remanded\nthe case to an ALJ for the resolution of certain issues. The ALJ is-\nsued a decision in August 2016, which is the subject of this appeal.\n       I. Pupo\u2019s Medical Evidence\n       Pupo submitted medical and opinion evidence that reflects\nnumerous ailments over the years. In 2009, she was struck by a\nvehicle and doctors treated her for a broken clavicle and minor in-\njuries to other parts of her body. From 2011 to 2014, she visited\nDr. Omar Suarez routinely for physical exams with complaints of\nheadaches, episodes of weakness and fatigue, back pain, depres-\nsion, and left foot pain.\n        In July 2014, she began seeing Dr. Rolando E. Diaz, who,\nafter treating Pupo for a year and a half, completed a physical RFC\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021      Page: 5 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                         5\n\nquestionnaire for Pupo, listing the following diagnoses: low back\npain, uterine prolapse, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),\nurinary incontinence, hypothyroidism, obesity, hyperlipidemia,\nand diabetes mellitus type II. Pupo had never been hospitalized for\nher medical impairments. She had several secondary side effects\nfrom her medicines, including nausea and dizziness, but she had\nresponded to treatment as well as expected and no courses of treat-\nment had been discontinued because of side effects or ineffective-\nness. Her symptoms included fatigue, dizziness, and pain in her\nlow back, left clavicle, and left body side. This pain often interfered\nwith her attention and concentration. Despite these symptoms,\nDr. Diaz had not placed or requested any limitations on her activity\nin the RFC questionnaire.\n       When estimating Pupo\u2019s functional limitations in a compet-\nitive work situation, Dr. Diaz stated that Pupo could not walk far\nwithout rest or experiencing severe pain and she could sit or stand\nfor forty-five minutes at one time before needing to change posi-\ntions or walk around. Due to body pain, Pupo could rarely lift ten\npounds in a competitive work situation, but could use her hands\nfor simple grasping, pushing and pulling, and fine manipulation\nand could use her feet for repetitive movements. Dr. Diaz noted\nthat Pupo\u2019s impairments were not likely to produce \u201cgood days\u201d\nor \u201cbad days\u201d because her impairments consistently limited her\nfunctional capacity on a day-to-day basis.\n       From March 2011 to April 2016, Pupo visited several urolo-\ngists and gynecologists with complaints of urinary incontinence.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633      Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 6 of 24\n\n\n\n\n6                     Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\nDuring these visits Pupo complained that she had to wear five pads\na day, her doctors noted that she had a prolapsed bladder, and her\nsymptoms were not responding well to medication.\n       In addition to records on her physical impairments, Pupo\nalso submitted records about her psychological impairments. In\n2011, Pupo was diagnosed with major depressive disorder after\ncompleting a psychiatric evaluation. From May 2011 to February\n2014, she visited a psychiatrist, Dr. Rosa Amurrio, regularly for\ntreatment. Dr. Amurrio prescribed Pupo a variety of medications\nfor her mental disorders. Pupo was briefly committed to inpatient\ntreatment for one week after she told Dr. Amurrio that she had\nhallucinations and suicidal ideation. However, she later denied\nhaving had these symptoms after being discharged. During her\nregular visits, Dr. Amurrio reported that Pupo was casually\ndressed, had good eye contact and fluent speech, and was oriented.\nHer mood had improved slightly, but she still experienced forget-\nfulness, lack of energy, and anxiety. Pupo had complained of anxi-\nety and depression after running out of her medications but re-\nported that she had an improved mood and was doing much better\nwhile taking medications.\n        In July 2012, Dr. Amurrio completed a psychiatric and psy-\nchosocial evaluation of Pupo. She diagnosed Pupo with major de-\npressive disorder and severe and generalized anxiety disorder. Dr.\nAmurrio had not placed or requested any limitations on Pupo\u2019s ac-\ntivities. Her impairments were likely to produce good and bad\ndays because her decreased mood could cause bad days. She\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633         Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 7 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                          7\n\nsuffered from depressive syndrome with the following clinical fea-\ntures: anhedonia; appetite disturbance with change in weight; dif-\nficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking; hallucinations, delu-\nsions, or paranoid thinking, and feelings of guilt or worthlessness.\nPupo\u2019s condition did not result in a complete inability to function\nindependently outside of her home.\n        Next, Dr. Amurrio reported that Pupo had the following re-\nstrictions for work-related mental activities: mild restrictions in car-\nrying out short, simple instructions; moderate restrictions in un-\nderstanding and remembering detailed instructions; moderate re-\nstrictions in carrying out detailed instructions; and mild restrictions\nin the ability to make judgments on simple work-related decisions.\nPupo also had mild restrictions for interacting appropriately with\ncoworkers and marked restrictions for responding appropriately to\nwork pressures and changes in a usual work setting.\n       II. The ALJ Hearing and Decision\n       Pupo had an ALJ hearing in April 2016. She testified that she\nwas 54-years old and born in Cuba. She could not communicate in\nEnglish, and could not work due to depression, pain in her left clav-\nicle and left leg, diabetes, high blood pressure, and urinary inconti-\nnence. Her only work experience was a six-month stint in 2007\u201308\ncleaning construction homes. She testified that she could stand or\nwalk for forty-five minutes to an hour, could sit for about an hour\nbefore feeling increased pain, and could lift twenty pounds without\nfeeling an increase in pain.

A vocational expert (VE) also testified about hypo-\nthetical individuals with Pupo\u2019s age, education, and past work ex-\nperience who could perform work at the medium exertional level\nand found that there were three jobs that she could do: industrial\ncleaner, laundry worker, and hand packager.\n       The ALJ issued a decision in August 2016 which concluded\nthat Pupo was not disabled. The ALJ made the following findings:\n    \u2022 At Step One of the sequential analysis, Pupo had not en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity since her application for\n      benefits.\n    \u2022 At Step Two, Pupo had numerous severe impairments: ma-\n      jor depressive disorder, hypertension, hypothyroidism, dia-\n      betes type II, and obesity.\n    \u2022 At Step Three, Pupo did not have an impairment or combi-\n      nation of impairments that met or medically equaled the se-\n      verity of one of the listed impairments (a Listing) in 20 C.F.R\n      Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n    \u2022 Pupo had the RFC to perform medium work except that she\n      was limited to work that requires her to remember and im-\n      plement simple instructions, have occasional contact with\n      coworkers, and no contact with the general public. In mak-\n      ing this determination, the ALJ noted that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s\n      statements concerning the intensity, persistence and\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 9 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633              Opinion of the Court                        9\n\n      limiting effects of [her] symptoms are not entirely consistent\n      with the medical evidence and other evidence in the rec-\n      ord.\u201d\n   \u2022 At Step Four, Pupo had no past relevant work.\n   \u2022 At Step Five, there were jobs that existed in significant num-\n     bers in the national economy that Pupo could perform, con-\n     sidering her age, education, work experience, and RFC.\n   \u2022 Accordingly, the ALJ found that Pupo was \u201cnot disabled.\u201d\n       Notably, the ALJ did not identify Pupo\u2019s stress urinary in-\ncontinence as one of her severe impairments at Step Two and did\nnot address the effect of her stress urinary incontinence on her\nphysical abilities at Step Four. The ALJ\u2019s Step Four finding that\nPupo had the RFC to perform \u201cmedium work\u201d meant that she\ncould, among other things, lift up to fifty pounds at a time and\ncould frequently lift and carry up to twenty-five pounds. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.967(d). In making this RFC assessment, the ALJ \u201cas-\nsign[ed] minimal weight\u201d to the opinion of Dr. Diaz, Pupo\u2019s treat-\ning physician, in his RFC questionnaire. The ALJ explained that\nobjective medical evidence, including Dr. Diaz\u2019s own \u201crelatively\nunremarkable\u201d physical exams, did not support Dr. Diaz\u2019s RFC\nopinion.\n       In October 2016, Pupo filed with the Appeals Council writ-\nten exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. She also submitted additional\nevidence including her treatment records between May 2016 and\nSeptember 2016.

When, as here,\nthe claimant appeals an ALJ\u2019s new decision after a district court remand, the\nclaimant instead files \u201cwritten exceptions\u201d to the ALJ\u2019s new decision. 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.1484(a); see also SSA, Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Man-\nual (HALLEX) I-4-8-5A (2020) (explaining that when there is a district court\nremand, the claimant files written exceptions rather than a request for review).\n         The Appeals Council \u201cmay assume jurisdiction\u201d based on the claim-\nant\u2019s written exceptions and applies the same \u201cstandard set forth in \u00a7 416.1470\u201d\napplicable to requests for review. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1484(a).

Whether the ALJ Erred by Failing to Consider Using the\nOlder Age Category in Assessing Pupo\u2019s Ability to Adapt to Other\nWork.\n        Pupo\u2019s first issue on appeal involves Step Five of the ALJ\u2019s\nanalysis. After there has been a finding at Step Four that the claim-\nant cannot return to her past relevant work, 2 the burden shifts to\nthe agency to show that a significant number of jobs exist in the\nnational economy that the claimant could perform. Winschel v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir. 2011). There\nare two paths that the ALJ may take to make this determination.\nFirst, the ALJ can turn to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, re-\nferred to as the grids, which will direct a finding of \u201cdisabled\u201d or\n\u201cnot disabled.\u201d See 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2. Second, if\n\n\n2 In thiscase, the ALJ found at Step Four that Pupo had no past relevant work,\nwhich means, in effect, she cannot return to any past relevant work. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.960(b) (defining \u201cpast relevant work\u201d as work the claimant had\n\u201cdone within the past 15 years, that was substantial gainful activity, and that\nlasted long enough for [the claimant] to learn to do it\u201d).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 12 of 24\n\n\n\n\n12                      Opinion of the Court                 19-14633\n\nthe grids do not apply because a claimant does not meet all the cri-\nteria, then the grids should be used as a framework along with in-\ndependent evidence. Id. \u00a7 200.00(d).\n        The grids are comprised of a series of tables, referred to as\nrules, with each table corresponding to a different RFC (sedentary,\nlight, medium). The regulations provide that \u201c[w]here the findings\nof fact made with respect to a particular individual\u2019s vocational fac-\ntors and residual functional capacity coincide with all of the criteria\nof a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\nindividual is or is not disabled.\u201d Id. \u00a7 200.00(a). The vocational\nfactors considered include the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work\nexperience. Under the regulations, \u201cage\u201d means a claimant\u2019s\n\u201cchronological age.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(a). A person aged 50 to\n54 is classified as \u201cclosely approaching advanced age,\u201d and a person\naged 55 or older is classified as \u201cadvanced age.\u201d Id. \u00a7 416.963(d)\u2013\n(e).\n       In a sense, the grids function like an equation, where the ALJ\ninputs the various factors, and an outcome is generated. See Gib-\nson v. Heckler, 762 F.2d 1516, 1520 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam)\n(describing the grids as \u201ca series of matrices which correlate a set of\nvariables\u201d to render a finding of disabled or not disabled). While\nthis method is clean and efficient, every claimant is unique and\nsometimes the criteria in the grids do not accurately reflect the true\ncapabilities of a particular claimant. See id. To ensure that the ALJ\ndoes not rely too heavily on the grids, we have proscribed the me-\nchanical application of the grids based on the claimant\u2019s age in\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 13 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                       13\n\ndetermining whether the claimant can adapt to other work.\nWalker v. Bowen, 826 F.2d 996, 1002 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam).\nWhile the ALJ may use the claimant\u2019s age in applying the grids, it\nwill not be conclusive. Reeves v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 519, 525 (11th\nCir. 1984) (per curiam). Before the ALJ relies on the age factor of\nthe grids in making his determination, the claimant should first be\nallowed to proffer \u201csubstantial credible evidence that his ability to\nadapt is less than the level established under the grids for persons\nhis age.\u201d Id.\n        Relevant to this case, the grids \u201cmay not be used when the\nclaimant\u2019s non-exertional impairments are severe enough to pre-\nclude a wide range of employment at the level indicated by the ex-\nertional impairments.\u201d Walker, 826 F.2d at 1003 (emphasis omit-\nted). Examples of non-exertional impairments are nervousness or\nanxiety, difficulty concentrating, or difficulty remembering de-\ntailed instructions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.969a(c). The grids may still be\nused as a framework in this situation, but the ALJ will need to pro-\nvide independent evidence, preferably through VE testimony, to\nassess the impact these limitations have on the claimant\u2019s ability to\nadapt to other work in the national economy. Wilson v. Barnhart,\n284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). For the VE\u2019s tes-\ntimony to meet the substantial evidence standard, \u201cthe ALJ must\npose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s\nimpairments.\u201d Id.\n      Pupo argues that the ALJ erred at Step Five because he did\nnot consider whether the older age category should apply to Pupo.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633         Date Filed: 11/03/2021   Page: 14 of 24\n\n\n\n\n14                        Opinion of the Court             19-14633\n\nThe Commissioner responds that the ALJ did not err for two rea-\nsons: (1) Pupo did not offer any evidence that the older age cate-\ngory should apply and (2) the ALJ did not mechanically apply the\nage categories because he relied on VE testimony and only used\nthe grids as a framework. On the day the ALJ issued his decision,\nPupo was 66 days shy of her 55th birthday, which would have\nplaced her in the \u201cadvanced age\u201d category. Thus, Pupo contends\nthat this case involves a borderline age situation.\n       We have yet to address the borderline age situation in a pub-\nlished opinion. The relevant regulation provides that the Commis-\nsioner:\n      will not apply the age categories mechanically in a\n      borderline situation. If [the claimant is] within a few\n      days to a few months of reaching an older age cate-\n      gory, and using the older age category would result\n      in a determination or decision that [the claimant is]\n      disabled, [the Commissioner] will consider whether\n      to use the older age category after evaluating the\n      overall impact of all the factors of [the claimant\u2019s]\n      case.\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(b).\n      At the outset, we reject the Commissioner\u2019s argument that\nPupo was required to offer additional evidence that the older age\ncategory should apply in a borderline age situation. The Commis-\nsioner cites to our rule in Reeves in support of its argument.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 15 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                        15\n\nHowever, Reeves is distinguishable because it did not concern a\nborderline age situation. There, the claimant was 37 and the next\nhigher age category began at 50. Reeves, 734 F.2d at 525. Further-\nmore, we held there that the burden is on the claimant to show\nthat the grids should not be applied mechanically based on the\nclaimant\u2019s age. Id. In contrast, \u00a7 416.963(b) does not place the bur-\nden on the claimant, but rather says the Commissioner \u201cwill con-\nsider whether to use the older age category after evaluating the\noverall impact of all the factors.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(b) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, not only are the facts in Reeves not directly on point\nhere but applying it in borderline age situations would be incon-\nsistent with the language of the regulation.\n       Nevertheless, we agree with the Commissioner that the ALJ\ndid not err in this case because he did not rely solely on the grids in\nmaking his disability determination. The whole crux of the bor-\nderline age regulation is that the Commissioner will not apply the\nage categories, i.e., the grids, mechanically. We agree that the ALJ\ncould not have erred in failing to consider the borderline age situa-\ntion because he did not apply the grids mechanically in this case,\nbut instead relied on VE testimony due to Pupo\u2019s non-exertional\nlimitations.\n       This is consistent with other circuits that have considered\nthe borderline age situation. For example, the Tenth Circuit in\nDaniels interpreted the borderline age regulation to mean that the\nCommissioner may not apply the age categories mechanically \u201cin\nrelying on the grids to determine whether a claimant is disabled.\u201d\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 16 of 24\n\n\n\n\n16                     Opinion of the Court                 19-14633\n\nDaniels v. Apfel, 154 F.3d 1129, 1136 (10th Cir. 1998) (emphasis\nadded); see also Kane v. Heckler, 776 F.2d 1130, 1134 (3d Cir. 1985)\n(\u201cWhere a procrustean application of the grids results in a case that,\nbut for the passage of a few days, would be decided differently, such\nan application would appear to be inappropriate.\u201d).\n       In sum, we hold that the ALJ did not mechanically apply the\nage categories here because he did not rely on the grids, but instead\nused the grids as a framework along with independent evidence\nfrom VE testimony. This is consistent with the regulations and our\nprecedent for the proper analysis at Step Five. Accordingly, the ALJ\ndid not err by not addressing the borderline age situation and sub-\nstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision in this regard.\n       II. Whether the Additional Evidence Submitted to the Ap-\npeals Council Was \u201cNew and Material\u201d and Warrants Remand for\nFurther Consideration by the ALJ.\n       Turning to the second issue on appeal, Pupo argues that the\nAppeals Council erred in not considering additional medical rec-\nords she submitted after the ALJ issued his decision. Generally,\nclaimants are permitted to present new evidence at each stage of\ntheir administrative process, including before the Appeals Council.\nIngram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 496 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th\nCir. 2007). The Appeals Council will review a case if it \u201creceives\nadditional evidence that is new, material, and relates to the period\non or before the date of the hearing decision, and there is a reason-\nable probability that the additional evidence would change the\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633           Date Filed: 11/03/2021       Page: 17 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                  Opinion of the Court                             17\n\noutcome of the decision.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5). 3 We review\nde novo the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal to consider new evidence.\nWashington, 806 F.3d at 1320\u201321. \u201c[W]hen the Appeals Council\nerroneously refuses to consider evidence, it commits legal error\nand remand is appropriate.\u201d Id. at 1321.\n       Here, the Appeals Council erred in refusing to consider\nPupo\u2019s new, material, and chronologically relevant evidence.\nPupo submitted medical records showing that she had surgery be-\ncause of her stress urinary incontinence nine days before the ALJ\nissued his decision. This new evidence showed that her stress in-\ncontinence was in fact severe and serious enough to require sur-\ngery. At the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision, the medical evidence in the\nrecord indicated that, after more conservative medication treat-\nment for her stress incontinence had failed, Pupo\u2019s urologist and\n\n\n\n3 In 2016, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) was amended, effective January 17, 2017,\nbut with compliance not required until May 1, 2017. See 81 Fed. Reg. 90987,\n90996 (Dec. 16, 2016). In other words, the new regulation went into effect\nafter Pupo submitted her new evidence to the Appeals Council but before the\nAppeals Council issued its decision refusing to consider it. The new version\nof \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) added the requirement that the new evidence show a rea-\nsonable probability of a different outcome before the Appeals Council will re-\nview the new evidence. Prior to this change, our precedent interpreted the\nterm \u201cmaterial\u201d in \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) to require the new evidence to show a rea-\nsonable possibility of a different outcome. See Washington v. Soc. Sec. Ad-\nmin, Comm\u2019r., 806 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). Because the\nparties do not dispute that the new version of \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) applies to\nPupo\u2019s new evidence, we assume, without deciding, that it does.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633      Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 18 of 24\n\n\n\n\n18                     Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\ngynecologists began discussing with her a possible surgical treat-\nment. However, no surgery had ever been performed.\n        These new medical records showing Pupo in fact had sur-\ngery for her stress incontinence constitute new and material evi-\ndence that had a reasonable probability of changing the outcome\nof the decision. This is particularly true when considered with the\nALJ\u2019s findings at Step Four that Pupo had never been hospitalized\nfor any of her physical impairments and that her doctors\u2019 physical\ntreatment notes had been \u201cconsistently unremarkable.\u201d Both of\nthese findings now appear to be inaccurate with respect to her\nstress incontinence when these new records are considered.\n       These now-evident factual errors are compounded by the\nfact that, at Step Four, the ALJ did not adequately consider the ef-\nfects of Pupo\u2019s stress incontinence on her ability to perform me-\ndium work, especially the lifting requirements, as discussed below.\nConsidering this new objective medical evidence bearing on the\nseverity of her stress incontinence, a factfinder could reasonably\nconclude that Pupo could not have lifted up to fifty pounds at a\ntime or frequently lifted and carried objects weighing up to twenty-\nfive pounds during the relevant time period. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s\nhypothetical question to the vocational expert asked only about\nmedium work with no lifting restrictions. Given the foregoing, the\nAppeals Council erred in concluding that this new evidence failed\nto show a reasonable probability of a different outcome. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5). Because the Appeals Council failed to\nproperly consider this new evidence submitted by Pupo, we\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 19 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                       19\n\nremand for consideration of Pupo\u2019s disability eligibility based on\nthe total record.\n      III. Whether Substantial Evidence Supports the ALJ\u2019s As-\nsessment of Pupo\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity (RFC).\n        Pupo\u2019s third issue concerns Step Four of the sequential anal-\nysis, where the ALJ must determine a claimant\u2019s RFC by consider-\ning all relevant medical and other evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(e).\nThe RFC is an assessment of a claimant\u2019s ability to do work despite\nher impairments. Id. \u00a7 416.945(a). The ALJ makes this determina-\ntion by considering the claimant\u2019s ability to lift and carry weight,\nsit, stand, push, pull, walk, etc., as well as the claimant\u2019s mental\nabilities. Id. \u00a7 416.945(b)\u2013(c). The claimant\u2019s RFC is then used to\ndetermine her capability of performing various designated levels of\nwork (sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy). See id.\n\u00a7 416.967. As noted earlier, a person with the RFC to perform me-\ndium work can lift \u201cno more than 50 pounds at a time with fre-\nquent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 25 pounds,\u201d and\ncan also perform any sedentary or light work. Id. \u00a7 416.967(c). The\nSSA has provided that:\n      In assessing RFC, the [ALJ] must consider limitations\n      and restrictions imposed by all of an individual\u2019s im-\n      pairments, even those that are not \u201csevere.\u201d While a\n      \u201cnot severe\u201d impairment(s) standing alone may not\n      significantly limit an individual\u2019s ability to do basic\n      work activities, it may\u2014when considered with\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 20 of 24\n\n\n\n\n20                     Opinion of the Court                 19-14633\n\n       limitations or restrictions due to other impairments\u2014\n       be critical to the outcome of a claim.\nSocial Security Regulation (SSR) 96-8p, 61 Fed. Reg. 34474, 34477\n(July 2, 1996); see also Schink v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 935 F.3d 1245,\n1268 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (\u201cConsideration of all impair-\nments, severe and non-severe, is required when assessing a claim-\nant\u2019s RFC.\u201d).\n       In Schink, we found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not sup-\nported by substantial evidence because the ALJ did not consider the\nclaimant\u2019s mental impairments when evaluating the claimant\u2019s\nRFC, despite the ALJ stating he \u201cconsidered all symptoms.\u201d\nSchink, 935 F.3d at 1269. Although the mental impairments were\nnon-severe, the ALJ was still required to consider them when as-\nsessing the claimant\u2019s RFC. Id. Since the ALJ provided no assess-\nment on the claimant\u2019s mental impairments, we found the ALJ\u2019s\noverall assessment of the claimant\u2019s RFC to be inadequate. Id. at\n1270.\n       Similarly, here, although the ALJ stated he \u201cconsidered all\nsymptoms,\u201d his decision demonstrates that he did not. The ALJ\ndid not consider Pupo\u2019s stress urinary incontinence when he con-\nducted his RFC assessment. He noted that she had been treated for\nincontinence in his decision but did not discuss how her inconti-\nnence would impact her ability to perform work at the medium\nlevel, especially how it would affect her ability to lift and carry\nweight. This is particularly troubling given that the record shows\nthat Pupo saw numerous gynecologists and a urologist about her\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021      Page: 21 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                         21\n\nincontinence and uterine prolapse; she complained about inconti-\nnence to multiple providers, noting that she had to wear five pads\na day; she was referred to have surgery in 2014 but was unable to\nreceive medical clearance; she complained of incontinence when\ncoughing or lifting weight; she had a positive cough test; and treat-\nment through medication had failed.\n       Like the ALJ in Schink, the ALJ here was required to con-\nsider all of Pupo\u2019s impairments, severe or not, when evaluating her\nRFC. The ALJ did this for Pupo\u2019s other impairments, such as back\npain, obesity, and depression, but failed to mention any impact that\nher incontinence might have had on her RFC during the relevant\ntime period.\n        It is also worth noting that the ALJ did not rely on any opin-\nion evidence from a medical doctor regarding Pupo\u2019s physical abil-\nities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and carrying, in de-\ntermining her RFC.\n       To be sure, an ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is an administrative\nfinding based on all the relevant evidence, including both medical\nand nonmedical evidence. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a)(3); SSR 96-8p,\n61 Fed. Reg. 34474, 34476\u201377. While medical opinion evidence as\nto a claimant\u2019s physical abilities and limitations is not required in\nevery case, it is particularly helpful in a complicated medical case\nlike Pupo\u2019s, in which the claimant has many longstanding physical\nand mental ailments. Moreover, the ALJ has a duty to \u201cmake every\nreasonable effort to ensure that the file contains sufficient evidence\nto assess RFC.\u201d SSR 96-8p, 61 Fed. Reg. 34474, 34477; see also 20\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 22 of 24\n\n\n\n\n22                     Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a)(3) (stating that the agency is \u201cresponsible for\ndeveloping [the claimant\u2019s] complete medical history, including ar-\nranging for a consultative examination(s) if necessary, and making\nevery reasonable effort to help [the claimant] get medical reports\nfrom [the claimant\u2019s] medical sources\u201d).\n      Here, however, the record contains no opinion about\nPupo\u2019s physical abilities and limitations from Pupo\u2019s urologist or\nany of her gynecologists who treated her incontinence or from a\nconsulting doctor who had either reviewed her medical records or\nexamined her. Further, the ALJ gave minimal weight to Dr. Diaz\u2019s\nopinion about Pupo\u2019s physical abilities and limitations, leaving the\nALJ without any medical opinion on that issue at all.\n        The absence of such medical opinion evidence is particularly\nconcerning here because the ALJ also failed to conduct a function-\nby-function assessment of Pupo\u2019s physical abilities and to explain\nhow the non-opinion evidence in the record\u2014both medical and\nnonmedical\u2014supported his finding that Pupo could perform all the\nphysical requirements for medium work, including lifting as much\nas fifty pounds at a time and frequently lifting up to twenty-five\npounds. See SSR 96-8p, 61 Fed. Reg. 34474, 34477\u201378 (requiring\nthe ALJ to perform a \u201cfunction-by-function\u201d RFC assessment to\navoid overlooking some of the claimant\u2019s limitations or using the\nincorrect exertional category and requiring the ALJ to include a\n\u201cnarrative discussion describing how the evidence supports each\nconclusion, citing specific medical facts (e.g., laboratory findings)\nand nonmedical evidence (e.g., daily activities, observations)\u201d).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633           Date Filed: 11/03/2021       Page: 23 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                  Opinion of the Court                             23\n\nInstead, the ALJ merely found, without explanation or citation to\nsupporting evidence, that \u201c[t]he objective evidence does not sup-\nport an RFC less than the medium exertional level.\u201d\n       Accordingly, given the combination of all these factors and\nshortcomings, we conclude that substantial evidence does not sup-\nport the ALJ\u2019s finding that Pupo could perform medium work with\nnon-exertional limits because he did not adequately consider\nPupo\u2019s incontinence in assessing her RFC.4\n                             CONCLUSION\n       We reverse the order of the district court affirming the deci-\nsion of the Commissioner. We find that substantial evidence does\nnot support the Commissioner\u2019s decision because the ALJ did not\nconsider Pupo\u2019s incontinence when determining her RFC. Fur-\nther, the Appeals Council erred in not considering the new evi-\ndence submitted by Pupo. Upon remand from the district court,\nthe ALJ must consider the effects of Pupo\u2019s incontinence on her\nRFC, including the new evidence submitted by Pupo on this con-\ndition. In remanding this case, we offer no opinion as to whether\nPupo can ultimately establish that she is disabled within the mean-\ning of the Social Security Act. We have determined only that the\n\n4 Pupo\u2019s remaining issues on appeal challenge the ALJ\u2019s decision to not give\ncontrolling weight to her doctors\u2019 opinions and finding that her mental im-\npairments did not meet a listed impairment. Because we remand on two of\nher other issues, we offer no opinion as to whether the ALJ erred in these re-\ngards. On remand from the district court, the ALJ is to reconsider Pupo\u2019s\nclaim based on the entire record.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633     Date Filed: 11/03/2021   Page: 24 of 24\n\n\n\n\n24                    Opinion of the Court              19-14633\n\nALJ and the Appeals Council did not adequately consider certain\nissues and therefore the Commissioner\u2019s decision is not supported\nby substantial evidence.\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f",

Docket No. 1:17-cv-23609-JB\n                   ____________________\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 2 of 24\n\n\n\n\n2                      Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\nBefore WILSON, ROSENBAUM, and HULL, Circuit Judges.\nWILSON, Circuit Judge:\n       Maria Teresa Pupo appeals the district court\u2019s order affirm-\ning the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration\u2019s\n(Commissioner) denial of her application for supplemental security\nincome (SSI). Pupo raises five issues on appeal: (1) the administra-\ntive law judge (ALJ) erred by not considering whether to apply a\nhigher age category, (2) the Appeals Council erred by not consid-\nering additional medical evidence she submitted, (3) the ALJ erred\nin assessing her residual functional capacity (RFC), (4) the ALJ\nerred in not giving controlling weight to her treating doctor and\npsychiatrist, and (5) the ALJ erred in finding her mental impair-\nments did not meet a listed impairment. We find that the Com-\nmissioner\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence for\ntwo reasons. First, the ALJ erred by not addressing one of Pupo\u2019s\nmedical diagnoses, her incontinence, when assessing her RFC. Sec-\nond, the Appeals Council erred by not considering the new medical\nevidence submitted by Pupo following the ALJ\u2019s denial of her SSI\nclaim. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision affirm-\ning the ALJ\u2019s decision and remand to the Commissioner to reeval-\nuate Pupo\u2019s claim consistent with this opinion.\n                         BACKGROUND\n      Before turning to the facts of the case, here is a brief over-\nview of the process for obtaining social security benefits. The\nclaimant applies in writing to the Social Security Administration\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 3 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                        3\n\n(SSA) and if the SSA denies the application, the claimant has sixty\ndays to seek reconsideration. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b)(1). If the SSA\ndenies reconsideration, the claimant can request a hearing before\nan ALJ.\n      At the hearing, the ALJ performs a five-step analysis in de-\ntermining if the applicant is disabled. The steps are as follows:\n   1. At Step One, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity. If the claimant is en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity, then the claimant is not\n      disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i).\n   2. At Step Two, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      a severe impairment. A claimant who does not have a se-\n      vere impairment is not disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n   3. At Step Three, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      an impairment that meets or equals a listed impairment. A\n      claimant who meets or equals a listed impairment is disa-\n      bled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii).\n   4. At Step Four, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      any impairments that prevent her from returning to her past\n      relevant work. If the claimant has a severe impairment that\n      does not equal or meet the severity of the listed impairment,\n      the ALJ proceeds to Step Four and assesses the claimant\u2019s\n      RFC. If the claimant can return to her past or relevant work,\n      then she is not disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 4 of 24\n\n\n\n\n4                      Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\n    5. At Step Five, the ALJ determines whether the claimant\u2019s im-\n       pairment prevents her from doing any other work. If the\n       claimant can adjust to other work, she is not disabled, but if\n       she cannot adjust, she is disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v).\n       The claimant may also obtain judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision in a United States district court by commencing a civil ac-\ntion within sixty days of notice of the decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).\n       Pupo first applied for SSI in June 2011, alleging that she was\nunable to work due to depression, body tremors, and high blood\npressure. Her initial application was denied, but, in June 2015, her\ncase was remanded by the district court for further proceedings\npursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Appeals Coun-\ncil then vacated the Commissioner\u2019s final decision and remanded\nthe case to an ALJ for the resolution of certain issues. The ALJ is-\nsued a decision in August 2016, which is the subject of this appeal.\n       I. Pupo\u2019s Medical Evidence\n       Pupo submitted medical and opinion evidence that reflects\nnumerous ailments over the years. In 2009, she was struck by a\nvehicle and doctors treated her for a broken clavicle and minor in-\njuries to other parts of her body. From 2011 to 2014, she visited\nDr. Omar Suarez routinely for physical exams with complaints of\nheadaches, episodes of weakness and fatigue, back pain, depres-\nsion, and left foot pain.\n        In July 2014, she began seeing Dr. Rolando E. Diaz, who,\nafter treating Pupo for a year and a half, completed a physical RFC\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021      Page: 5 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                         5\n\nquestionnaire for Pupo, listing the following diagnoses: low back\npain, uterine prolapse, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),\nurinary incontinence, hypothyroidism, obesity, hyperlipidemia,\nand diabetes mellitus type II. Pupo had never been hospitalized for\nher medical impairments. She had several secondary side effects\nfrom her medicines, including nausea and dizziness, but she had\nresponded to treatment as well as expected and no courses of treat-\nment had been discontinued because of side effects or ineffective-\nness. Her symptoms included fatigue, dizziness, and pain in her\nlow back, left clavicle, and left body side. This pain often interfered\nwith her attention and concentration. Despite these symptoms,\nDr. Diaz had not placed or requested any limitations on her activity\nin the RFC questionnaire.\n       When estimating Pupo\u2019s functional limitations in a compet-\nitive work situation, Dr. Diaz stated that Pupo could not walk far\nwithout rest or experiencing severe pain and she could sit or stand\nfor forty-five minutes at one time before needing to change posi-\ntions or walk around. Due to body pain, Pupo could rarely lift ten\npounds in a competitive work situation, but could use her hands\nfor simple grasping, pushing and pulling, and fine manipulation\nand could use her feet for repetitive movements. Dr. Diaz noted\nthat Pupo\u2019s impairments were not likely to produce \u201cgood days\u201d\nor \u201cbad days\u201d because her impairments consistently limited her\nfunctional capacity on a day-to-day basis.\n       From March 2011 to April 2016, Pupo visited several urolo-\ngists and gynecologists with complaints of urinary incontinence.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633      Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 6 of 24\n\n\n\n\n6                     Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\nDuring these visits Pupo complained that she had to wear five pads\na day, her doctors noted that she had a prolapsed bladder, and her\nsymptoms were not responding well to medication.\n       In addition to records on her physical impairments, Pupo\nalso submitted records about her psychological impairments. In\n2011, Pupo was diagnosed with major depressive disorder after\ncompleting a psychiatric evaluation. From May 2011 to February\n2014, she visited a psychiatrist, Dr. Rosa Amurrio, regularly for\ntreatment. Dr. Amurrio prescribed Pupo a variety of medications\nfor her mental disorders. Pupo was briefly committed to inpatient\ntreatment for one week after she told Dr. Amurrio that she had\nhallucinations and suicidal ideation. However, she later denied\nhaving had these symptoms after being discharged. During her\nregular visits, Dr. Amurrio reported that Pupo was casually\ndressed, had good eye contact and fluent speech, and was oriented.\nHer mood had improved slightly, but she still experienced forget-\nfulness, lack of energy, and anxiety. Pupo had complained of anxi-\nety and depression after running out of her medications but re-\nported that she had an improved mood and was doing much better\nwhile taking medications.\n        In July 2012, Dr. Amurrio completed a psychiatric and psy-\nchosocial evaluation of Pupo. She diagnosed Pupo with major de-\npressive disorder and severe and generalized anxiety disorder. Dr.\nAmurrio had not placed or requested any limitations on Pupo\u2019s ac-\ntivities. Her impairments were likely to produce good and bad\ndays because her decreased mood could cause bad days. She\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633         Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 7 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                          7\n\nsuffered from depressive syndrome with the following clinical fea-\ntures: anhedonia; appetite disturbance with change in weight; dif-\nficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking; hallucinations, delu-\nsions, or paranoid thinking, and feelings of guilt or worthlessness.\nPupo\u2019s condition did not result in a complete inability to function\nindependently outside of her home.\n        Next, Dr. Amurrio reported that Pupo had the following re-\nstrictions for work-related mental activities: mild restrictions in car-\nrying out short, simple instructions; moderate restrictions in un-\nderstanding and remembering detailed instructions; moderate re-\nstrictions in carrying out detailed instructions; and mild restrictions\nin the ability to make judgments on simple work-related decisions.\nPupo also had mild restrictions for interacting appropriately with\ncoworkers and marked restrictions for responding appropriately to\nwork pressures and changes in a usual work setting.\n       II. The ALJ Hearing and Decision\n       Pupo had an ALJ hearing in April 2016. She testified that she\nwas 54-years old and born in Cuba. She could not communicate in\nEnglish, and could not work due to depression, pain in her left clav-\nicle and left leg, diabetes, high blood pressure, and urinary inconti-\nnence. Her only work experience was a six-month stint in 2007\u201308\ncleaning construction homes. She testified that she could stand or\nwalk for forty-five minutes to an hour, could sit for about an hour\nbefore feeling increased pain, and could lift twenty pounds without\nfeeling an increase in pain. She did not do any housework, had\ndifficulty dressing herself because of her left arm pain, occasionally\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 8 of 24\n\n\n\n\n8                      Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\nwent grocery shopping with her husband, read the Bible for ten\nminutes per day, and needed her husband to remind her to take her\nmedications. A vocational expert (VE) also testified about hypo-\nthetical individuals with Pupo\u2019s age, education, and past work ex-\nperience who could perform work at the medium exertional level\nand found that there were three jobs that she could do: industrial\ncleaner, laundry worker, and hand packager.\n       The ALJ issued a decision in August 2016 which concluded\nthat Pupo was not disabled. The ALJ made the following findings:\n    \u2022 At Step One of the sequential analysis, Pupo had not en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity since her application for\n      benefits.\n    \u2022 At Step Two, Pupo had numerous severe impairments: ma-\n      jor depressive disorder, hypertension, hypothyroidism, dia-\n      betes type II, and obesity.\n    \u2022 At Step Three, Pupo did not have an impairment or combi-\n      nation of impairments that met or medically equaled the se-\n      verity of one of the listed impairments (a Listing) in 20 C.F.R\n      Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n    \u2022 Pupo had the RFC to perform medium work except that she\n      was limited to work that requires her to remember and im-\n      plement simple instructions, have occasional contact with\n      coworkers, and no contact with the general public. In mak-\n      ing this determination, the ALJ noted that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s\n      statements concerning the intensity, persistence and\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 9 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633              Opinion of the Court                        9\n\n      limiting effects of [her] symptoms are not entirely consistent\n      with the medical evidence and other evidence in the rec-\n      ord.\u201d\n   \u2022 At Step Four, Pupo had no past relevant work.\n   \u2022 At Step Five, there were jobs that existed in significant num-\n     bers in the national economy that Pupo could perform, con-\n     sidering her age, education, work experience, and RFC.\n   \u2022 Accordingly, the ALJ found that Pupo was \u201cnot disabled.\u201d\n       Notably, the ALJ did not identify Pupo\u2019s stress urinary in-\ncontinence as one of her severe impairments at Step Two and did\nnot address the effect of her stress urinary incontinence on her\nphysical abilities at Step Four. The ALJ\u2019s Step Four finding that\nPupo had the RFC to perform \u201cmedium work\u201d meant that she\ncould, among other things, lift up to fifty pounds at a time and\ncould frequently lift and carry up to twenty-five pounds. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.967(d). In making this RFC assessment, the ALJ \u201cas-\nsign[ed] minimal weight\u201d to the opinion of Dr. Diaz, Pupo\u2019s treat-\ning physician, in his RFC questionnaire. The ALJ explained that\nobjective medical evidence, including Dr. Diaz\u2019s own \u201crelatively\nunremarkable\u201d physical exams, did not support Dr. Diaz\u2019s RFC\nopinion.\n       In October 2016, Pupo filed with the Appeals Council writ-\nten exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. She also submitted additional\nevidence including her treatment records between May 2016 and\nSeptember 2016. The Appeals Council declined to assume\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633           Date Filed: 11/03/2021         Page: 10 of 24\n\n\n\n\n10                         Opinion of the Court                      19-14633\n\njurisdiction and found that the new evidence would not change the\noutcome.

When, as here,\nthe claimant appeals an ALJ\u2019s new decision after a district court remand, the\nclaimant instead files \u201cwritten exceptions\u201d to the ALJ\u2019s new decision. 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.1484(a); see also SSA, Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Man-\nual (HALLEX) I-4-8-5A (2020) (explaining that when there is a district court\nremand, the claimant files written exceptions rather than a request for review).\n         The Appeals Council \u201cmay assume jurisdiction\u201d based on the claim-\nant\u2019s written exceptions and applies the same \u201cstandard set forth in \u00a7 416.1470\u201d\napplicable to requests for review. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1484(a).

Whether the ALJ Erred by Failing to Consider Using the\nOlder Age Category in Assessing Pupo\u2019s Ability to Adapt to Other\nWork.\n        Pupo\u2019s first issue on appeal involves Step Five of the ALJ\u2019s\nanalysis. After there has been a finding at Step Four that the claim-\nant cannot return to her past relevant work, 2 the burden shifts to\nthe agency to show that a significant number of jobs exist in the\nnational economy that the claimant could perform. Winschel v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir. 2011). There\nare two paths that the ALJ may take to make this determination.\nFirst, the ALJ can turn to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, re-\nferred to as the grids, which will direct a finding of \u201cdisabled\u201d or\n\u201cnot disabled.\u201d See 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2. Second, if\n\n\n2 In thiscase, the ALJ found at Step Four that Pupo had no past relevant work,\nwhich means, in effect, she cannot return to any past relevant work. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.960(b) (defining \u201cpast relevant work\u201d as work the claimant had\n\u201cdone within the past 15 years, that was substantial gainful activity, and that\nlasted long enough for [the claimant] to learn to do it\u201d).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 12 of 24\n\n\n\n\n12                      Opinion of the Court                 19-14633\n\nthe grids do not apply because a claimant does not meet all the cri-\nteria, then the grids should be used as a framework along with in-\ndependent evidence. Id. \u00a7 200.00(d).\n        The grids are comprised of a series of tables, referred to as\nrules, with each table corresponding to a different RFC (sedentary,\nlight, medium). The regulations provide that \u201c[w]here the findings\nof fact made with respect to a particular individual\u2019s vocational fac-\ntors and residual functional capacity coincide with all of the criteria\nof a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\nindividual is or is not disabled.\u201d Id. \u00a7 200.00(a). The vocational\nfactors considered include the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work\nexperience. Under the regulations, \u201cage\u201d means a claimant\u2019s\n\u201cchronological age.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(a). A person aged 50 to\n54 is classified as \u201cclosely approaching advanced age,\u201d and a person\naged 55 or older is classified as \u201cadvanced age.\u201d Id. \u00a7 416.963(d)\u2013\n(e).\n       In a sense, the grids function like an equation, where the ALJ\ninputs the various factors, and an outcome is generated. See Gib-\nson v. Heckler, 762 F.2d 1516, 1520 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam)\n(describing the grids as \u201ca series of matrices which correlate a set of\nvariables\u201d to render a finding of disabled or not disabled). While\nthis method is clean and efficient, every claimant is unique and\nsometimes the criteria in the grids do not accurately reflect the true\ncapabilities of a particular claimant. See id. To ensure that the ALJ\ndoes not rely too heavily on the grids, we have proscribed the me-\nchanical application of the grids based on the claimant\u2019s age in\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 13 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                       13\n\ndetermining whether the claimant can adapt to other work.\nWalker v. Bowen, 826 F.2d 996, 1002 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam).\nWhile the ALJ may use the claimant\u2019s age in applying the grids, it\nwill not be conclusive. Reeves v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 519, 525 (11th\nCir. 1984) (per curiam). Before the ALJ relies on the age factor of\nthe grids in making his determination, the claimant should first be\nallowed to proffer \u201csubstantial credible evidence that his ability to\nadapt is less than the level established under the grids for persons\nhis age.\u201d Id.\n        Relevant to this case, the grids \u201cmay not be used when the\nclaimant\u2019s non-exertional impairments are severe enough to pre-\nclude a wide range of employment at the level indicated by the ex-\nertional impairments.\u201d Walker, 826 F.2d at 1003 (emphasis omit-\nted). Examples of non-exertional impairments are nervousness or\nanxiety, difficulty concentrating, or difficulty remembering de-\ntailed instructions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.969a(c). The grids may still be\nused as a framework in this situation, but the ALJ will need to pro-\nvide independent evidence, preferably through VE testimony, to\nassess the impact these limitations have on the claimant\u2019s ability to\nadapt to other work in the national economy. Wilson v. Barnhart,\n284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). For the VE\u2019s tes-\ntimony to meet the substantial evidence standard, \u201cthe ALJ must\npose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s\nimpairments.\u201d Id.\n      Pupo argues that the ALJ erred at Step Five because he did\nnot consider whether the older age category should apply to Pupo.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633         Date Filed: 11/03/2021   Page: 14 of 24\n\n\n\n\n14                        Opinion of the Court             19-14633\n\nThe Commissioner responds that the ALJ did not err for two rea-\nsons: (1) Pupo did not offer any evidence that the older age cate-\ngory should apply and (2) the ALJ did not mechanically apply the\nage categories because he relied on VE testimony and only used\nthe grids as a framework. On the day the ALJ issued his decision,\nPupo was 66 days shy of her 55th birthday, which would have\nplaced her in the \u201cadvanced age\u201d category. Thus, Pupo contends\nthat this case involves a borderline age situation.\n       We have yet to address the borderline age situation in a pub-\nlished opinion. The relevant regulation provides that the Commis-\nsioner:\n      will not apply the age categories mechanically in a\n      borderline situation. If [the claimant is] within a few\n      days to a few months of reaching an older age cate-\n      gory, and using the older age category would result\n      in a determination or decision that [the claimant is]\n      disabled, [the Commissioner] will consider whether\n      to use the older age category after evaluating the\n      overall impact of all the factors of [the claimant\u2019s]\n      case.\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(b).\n      At the outset, we reject the Commissioner\u2019s argument that\nPupo was required to offer additional evidence that the older age\ncategory should apply in a borderline age situation. The Commis-\nsioner cites to our rule in Reeves in support of its argument.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 15 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                        15\n\nHowever, Reeves is distinguishable because it did not concern a\nborderline age situation. There, the claimant was 37 and the next\nhigher age category began at 50. Reeves, 734 F.2d at 525. Further-\nmore, we held there that the burden is on the claimant to show\nthat the grids should not be applied mechanically based on the\nclaimant\u2019s age. Id. In contrast, \u00a7 416.963(b) does not place the bur-\nden on the claimant, but rather says the Commissioner \u201cwill con-\nsider whether to use the older age category after evaluating the\noverall impact of all the factors.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(b) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, not only are the facts in Reeves not directly on point\nhere but applying it in borderline age situations would be incon-\nsistent with the language of the regulation.\n       Nevertheless, we agree with the Commissioner that the ALJ\ndid not err in this case because he did not rely solely on the grids in\nmaking his disability determination. The whole crux of the bor-\nderline age regulation is that the Commissioner will not apply the\nage categories, i.e., the grids, mechanically. We agree that the ALJ\ncould not have erred in failing to consider the borderline age situa-\ntion because he did not apply the grids mechanically in this case,\nbut instead relied on VE testimony due to Pupo\u2019s non-exertional\nlimitations.\n       This is consistent with other circuits that have considered\nthe borderline age situation. For example, the Tenth Circuit in\nDaniels interpreted the borderline age regulation to mean that the\nCommissioner may not apply the age categories mechanically \u201cin\nrelying on the grids to determine whether a claimant is disabled.\u201d\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 16 of 24\n\n\n\n\n16                     Opinion of the Court                 19-14633\n\nDaniels v. Apfel, 154 F.3d 1129, 1136 (10th Cir. 1998) (emphasis\nadded); see also Kane v. Heckler, 776 F.2d 1130, 1134 (3d Cir. 1985)\n(\u201cWhere a procrustean application of the grids results in a case that,\nbut for the passage of a few days, would be decided differently, such\nan application would appear to be inappropriate.\u201d).\n       In sum, we hold that the ALJ did not mechanically apply the\nage categories here because he did not rely on the grids, but instead\nused the grids as a framework along with independent evidence\nfrom VE testimony. This is consistent with the regulations and our\nprecedent for the proper analysis at Step Five. Accordingly, the ALJ\ndid not err by not addressing the borderline age situation and sub-\nstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision in this regard.\n       II. Whether the Additional Evidence Submitted to the Ap-\npeals Council Was \u201cNew and Material\u201d and Warrants Remand for\nFurther Consideration by the ALJ.\n       Turning to the second issue on appeal, Pupo argues that the\nAppeals Council erred in not considering additional medical rec-\nords she submitted after the ALJ issued his decision. Generally,\nclaimants are permitted to present new evidence at each stage of\ntheir administrative process, including before the Appeals Council.\nIngram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 496 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th\nCir. 2007). The Appeals Council will review a case if it \u201creceives\nadditional evidence that is new, material, and relates to the period\non or before the date of the hearing decision, and there is a reason-\nable probability that the additional evidence would change the\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633           Date Filed: 11/03/2021       Page: 17 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                  Opinion of the Court                             17\n\noutcome of the decision.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5). 3 We review\nde novo the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal to consider new evidence.\nWashington, 806 F.3d at 1320\u201321. \u201c[W]hen the Appeals Council\nerroneously refuses to consider evidence, it commits legal error\nand remand is appropriate.\u201d Id. at 1321.\n       Here, the Appeals Council erred in refusing to consider\nPupo\u2019s new, material, and chronologically relevant evidence.\nPupo submitted medical records showing that she had surgery be-\ncause of her stress urinary incontinence nine days before the ALJ\nissued his decision. This new evidence showed that her stress in-\ncontinence was in fact severe and serious enough to require sur-\ngery. At the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision, the medical evidence in the\nrecord indicated that, after more conservative medication treat-\nment for her stress incontinence had failed, Pupo\u2019s urologist and\n\n\n\n3 In 2016, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) was amended, effective January 17, 2017,\nbut with compliance not required until May 1, 2017. See 81 Fed. Reg. 90987,\n90996 (Dec. 16, 2016). In other words, the new regulation went into effect\nafter Pupo submitted her new evidence to the Appeals Council but before the\nAppeals Council issued its decision refusing to consider it. The new version\nof \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) added the requirement that the new evidence show a rea-\nsonable probability of a different outcome before the Appeals Council will re-\nview the new evidence. Prior to this change, our precedent interpreted the\nterm \u201cmaterial\u201d in \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) to require the new evidence to show a rea-\nsonable possibility of a different outcome. See Washington v. Soc. Sec. Ad-\nmin, Comm\u2019r., 806 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). Because the\nparties do not dispute that the new version of \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) applies to\nPupo\u2019s new evidence, we assume, without deciding, that it does.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633      Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 18 of 24\n\n\n\n\n18                     Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\ngynecologists began discussing with her a possible surgical treat-\nment. However, no surgery had ever been performed.\n        These new medical records showing Pupo in fact had sur-\ngery for her stress incontinence constitute new and material evi-\ndence that had a reasonable probability of changing the outcome\nof the decision. This is particularly true when considered with the\nALJ\u2019s findings at Step Four that Pupo had never been hospitalized\nfor any of her physical impairments and that her doctors\u2019 physical\ntreatment notes had been \u201cconsistently unremarkable.\u201d Both of\nthese findings now appear to be inaccurate with respect to her\nstress incontinence when these new records are considered.\n       These now-evident factual errors are compounded by the\nfact that, at Step Four, the ALJ did not adequately consider the ef-\nfects of Pupo\u2019s stress incontinence on her ability to perform me-\ndium work, especially the lifting requirements, as discussed below.\nConsidering this new objective medical evidence bearing on the\nseverity of her stress incontinence, a factfinder could reasonably\nconclude that Pupo could not have lifted up to fifty pounds at a\ntime or frequently lifted and carried objects weighing up to twenty-\nfive pounds during the relevant time period. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s\nhypothetical question to the vocational expert asked only about\nmedium work with no lifting restrictions. Given the foregoing, the\nAppeals Council erred in concluding that this new evidence failed\nto show a reasonable probability of a different outcome. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5). Because the Appeals Council failed to\nproperly consider this new evidence submitted by Pupo, we\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 19 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                       19\n\nremand for consideration of Pupo\u2019s disability eligibility based on\nthe total record.\n      III. Whether Substantial Evidence Supports the ALJ\u2019s As-\nsessment of Pupo\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity (RFC).\n        Pupo\u2019s third issue concerns Step Four of the sequential anal-\nysis, where the ALJ must determine a claimant\u2019s RFC by consider-\ning all relevant medical and other evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(e).\nThe RFC is an assessment of a claimant\u2019s ability to do work despite\nher impairments. Id. \u00a7 416.945(a). The ALJ makes this determina-\ntion by considering the claimant\u2019s ability to lift and carry weight,\nsit, stand, push, pull, walk, etc., as well as the claimant\u2019s mental\nabilities. Id. \u00a7 416.945(b)\u2013(c). The claimant\u2019s RFC is then used to\ndetermine her capability of performing various designated levels of\nwork (sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy). See id.\n\u00a7 416.967. As noted earlier, a person with the RFC to perform me-\ndium work can lift \u201cno more than 50 pounds at a time with fre-\nquent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 25 pounds,\u201d and\ncan also perform any sedentary or light work. Id. \u00a7 416.967(c). The\nSSA has provided that:\n      In assessing RFC, the [ALJ] must consider limitations\n      and restrictions imposed by all of an individual\u2019s im-\n      pairments, even those that are not \u201csevere.\u201d While a\n      \u201cnot severe\u201d impairment(s) standing alone may not\n      significantly limit an individual\u2019s ability to do basic\n      work activities, it may\u2014when considered with\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 20 of 24\n\n\n\n\n20                     Opinion of the Court                 19-14633\n\n       limitations or restrictions due to other impairments\u2014\n       be critical to the outcome of a claim.\nSocial Security Regulation (SSR) 96-8p, 61 Fed.

Sec., 935 F.3d 1245,\n1268 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (\u201cConsideration of all impair-\nments, severe and non-severe, is required when assessing a claim-\nant\u2019s RFC.\u201d).\n       In Schink, we found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not sup-\nported by substantial evidence because the ALJ did not consider the\nclaimant\u2019s mental impairments when evaluating the claimant\u2019s\nRFC, despite the ALJ stating he \u201cconsidered all symptoms.\u201d\nSchink, 935 F.3d at 1269. Although the mental impairments were\nnon-severe, the ALJ was still required to consider them when as-\nsessing the claimant\u2019s RFC. Id. Since the ALJ provided no assess-\nment on the claimant\u2019s mental impairments, we found the ALJ\u2019s\noverall assessment of the claimant\u2019s RFC to be inadequate. Id. at\n1270.\n       Similarly, here, although the ALJ stated he \u201cconsidered all\nsymptoms,\u201d his decision demonstrates that he did not. The ALJ\ndid not consider Pupo\u2019s stress urinary incontinence when he con-\nducted his RFC assessment. He noted that she had been treated for\nincontinence in his decision but did not discuss how her inconti-\nnence would impact her ability to perform work at the medium\nlevel, especially how it would affect her ability to lift and carry\nweight. This is particularly troubling given that the record shows\nthat Pupo saw numerous gynecologists and a urologist about her\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021      Page: 21 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                         21\n\nincontinence and uterine prolapse; she complained about inconti-\nnence to multiple providers, noting that she had to wear five pads\na day; she was referred to have surgery in 2014 but was unable to\nreceive medical clearance; she complained of incontinence when\ncoughing or lifting weight; she had a positive cough test; and treat-\nment through medication had failed.\n       Like the ALJ in Schink, the ALJ here was required to con-\nsider all of Pupo\u2019s impairments, severe or not, when evaluating her\nRFC. The ALJ did this for Pupo\u2019s other impairments, such as back\npain, obesity, and depression, but failed to mention any impact that\nher incontinence might have had on her RFC during the relevant\ntime period.\n        It is also worth noting that the ALJ did not rely on any opin-\nion evidence from a medical doctor regarding Pupo\u2019s physical abil-\nities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and carrying, in de-\ntermining her RFC.\n       To be sure, an ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is an administrative\nfinding based on all the relevant evidence, including both medical\nand nonmedical evidence. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a)(3); SSR 96-8p,\n61 Fed. Reg. 34474, 34476\u201377. While medical opinion evidence as\nto a claimant\u2019s physical abilities and limitations is not required in\nevery case, it is particularly helpful in a complicated medical case\nlike Pupo\u2019s, in which the claimant has many longstanding physical\nand mental ailments. Moreover, the ALJ has a duty to \u201cmake every\nreasonable effort to ensure that the file contains sufficient evidence\nto assess RFC.\u201d SSR 96-8p, 61 Fed. Reg. 34474, 34477; see also 20\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 22 of 24\n\n\n\n\n22                     Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a)(3) (stating that the agency is \u201cresponsible for\ndeveloping [the claimant\u2019s] complete medical history, including ar-\nranging for a consultative examination(s) if necessary, and making\nevery reasonable effort to help [the claimant] get medical reports\nfrom [the claimant\u2019s] medical sources\u201d).\n      Here, however, the record contains no opinion about\nPupo\u2019s physical abilities and limitations from Pupo\u2019s urologist or\nany of her gynecologists who treated her incontinence or from a\nconsulting doctor who had either reviewed her medical records or\nexamined her. Further, the ALJ gave minimal weight to Dr. Diaz\u2019s\nopinion about Pupo\u2019s physical abilities and limitations, leaving the\nALJ without any medical opinion on that issue at all.\n        The absence of such medical opinion evidence is particularly\nconcerning here because the ALJ also failed to conduct a function-\nby-function assessment of Pupo\u2019s physical abilities and to explain\nhow the non-opinion evidence in the record\u2014both medical and\nnonmedical\u2014supported his finding that Pupo could perform all the\nphysical requirements for medium work, including lifting as much\nas fifty pounds at a time and frequently lifting up to twenty-five\npounds.

We find that substantial evidence does\nnot support the Commissioner\u2019s decision because the ALJ did not\nconsider Pupo\u2019s incontinence when determining her RFC. Fur-\nther, the Appeals Council erred in not considering the new evi-\ndence submitted by Pupo. Upon remand from the district court,\nthe ALJ must consider the effects of Pupo\u2019s incontinence on her\nRFC, including the new evidence submitted by Pupo on this con-\ndition. In remanding this case, we offer no opinion as to whether\nPupo can ultimately establish that she is disabled within the mean-\ning of the Social Security Act. We have determined only that the\n\n4 Pupo\u2019s remaining issues on appeal challenge the ALJ\u2019s decision to not give\ncontrolling weight to her doctors\u2019 opinions and finding that her mental im-\npairments did not meet a listed impairment. Because we remand on two of\nher other issues, we offer no opinion as to whether the ALJ erred in these re-\ngards. On remand from the district court, the ALJ is to reconsider Pupo\u2019s\nclaim based on the entire record.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633     Date Filed: 11/03/2021   Page: 24 of 24\n\n\n\n\n24                    Opinion of the Court              19-14633\n\nALJ and the Appeals Council did not adequately consider certain\nissues and therefore the Commissioner\u2019s decision is not supported\nby substantial evidence.\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f",

Pupo raises five issues on appeal: (1) the administra-\ntive law judge (ALJ) erred by not considering whether to apply a\nhigher age category, (2) the Appeals Council erred by not consid-\nering additional medical evidence she submitted, (3) the ALJ erred\nin assessing her residual functional capacity (RFC), (4) the ALJ\nerred in not giving controlling weight to her treating doctor and\npsychiatrist, and (5) the ALJ erred in finding her mental impair-\nments did not meet a listed impairment. We find that the Com-\nmissioner\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence for\ntwo reasons. First, the ALJ erred by not addressing one of Pupo\u2019s\nmedical diagnoses, her incontinence, when assessing her RFC. Sec-\nond, the Appeals Council erred by not considering the new medical\nevidence submitted by Pupo following the ALJ\u2019s denial of her SSI\nclaim. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision affirm-\ning the ALJ\u2019s decision and remand to the Commissioner to reeval-\nuate Pupo\u2019s claim consistent with this opinion.\n                         BACKGROUND\n      Before turning to the facts of the case, here is a brief over-\nview of the process for obtaining social security benefits. The\nclaimant applies in writing to the Social Security Administration\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 3 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                        3\n\n(SSA) and if the SSA denies the application, the claimant has sixty\ndays to seek reconsideration. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b)(1). If the SSA\ndenies reconsideration, the claimant can request a hearing before\nan ALJ.\n      At the hearing, the ALJ performs a five-step analysis in de-\ntermining if the applicant is disabled. The steps are as follows:\n   1. At Step One, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity. If the claimant is en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity, then the claimant is not\n      disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i).\n   2. At Step Two, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      a severe impairment. A claimant who does not have a se-\n      vere impairment is not disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n   3. At Step Three, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      an impairment that meets or equals a listed impairment. A\n      claimant who meets or equals a listed impairment is disa-\n      bled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii).\n   4. At Step Four, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has\n      any impairments that prevent her from returning to her past\n      relevant work. If the claimant has a severe impairment that\n      does not equal or meet the severity of the listed impairment,\n      the ALJ proceeds to Step Four and assesses the claimant\u2019s\n      RFC. If the claimant can return to her past or relevant work,\n      then she is not disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 4 of 24\n\n\n\n\n4                      Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\n    5. At Step Five, the ALJ determines whether the claimant\u2019s im-\n       pairment prevents her from doing any other work. If the\n       claimant can adjust to other work, she is not disabled, but if\n       she cannot adjust, she is disabled. Id. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v).\n       The claimant may also obtain judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision in a United States district court by commencing a civil ac-\ntion within sixty days of notice of the decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).\n       Pupo first applied for SSI in June 2011, alleging that she was\nunable to work due to depression, body tremors, and high blood\npressure. Her initial application was denied, but, in June 2015, her\ncase was remanded by the district court for further proceedings\npursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Appeals Coun-\ncil then vacated the Commissioner\u2019s final decision and remanded\nthe case to an ALJ for the resolution of certain issues. The ALJ is-\nsued a decision in August 2016, which is the subject of this appeal.\n       I. Pupo\u2019s Medical Evidence\n       Pupo submitted medical and opinion evidence that reflects\nnumerous ailments over the years. In 2009, she was struck by a\nvehicle and doctors treated her for a broken clavicle and minor in-\njuries to other parts of her body. From 2011 to 2014, she visited\nDr. Omar Suarez routinely for physical exams with complaints of\nheadaches, episodes of weakness and fatigue, back pain, depres-\nsion, and left foot pain.\n        In July 2014, she began seeing Dr. Rolando E. Diaz, who,\nafter treating Pupo for a year and a half, completed a physical RFC\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021      Page: 5 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                         5\n\nquestionnaire for Pupo, listing the following diagnoses: low back\npain, uterine prolapse, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),\nurinary incontinence, hypothyroidism, obesity, hyperlipidemia,\nand diabetes mellitus type II. Pupo had never been hospitalized for\nher medical impairments. She had several secondary side effects\nfrom her medicines, including nausea and dizziness, but she had\nresponded to treatment as well as expected and no courses of treat-\nment had been discontinued because of side effects or ineffective-\nness. Her symptoms included fatigue, dizziness, and pain in her\nlow back, left clavicle, and left body side. This pain often interfered\nwith her attention and concentration. Despite these symptoms,\nDr. Diaz had not placed or requested any limitations on her activity\nin the RFC questionnaire.\n       When estimating Pupo\u2019s functional limitations in a compet-\nitive work situation, Dr. Diaz stated that Pupo could not walk far\nwithout rest or experiencing severe pain and she could sit or stand\nfor forty-five minutes at one time before needing to change posi-\ntions or walk around. Due to body pain, Pupo could rarely lift ten\npounds in a competitive work situation, but could use her hands\nfor simple grasping, pushing and pulling, and fine manipulation\nand could use her feet for repetitive movements. Dr. Diaz noted\nthat Pupo\u2019s impairments were not likely to produce \u201cgood days\u201d\nor \u201cbad days\u201d because her impairments consistently limited her\nfunctional capacity on a day-to-day basis.\n       From March 2011 to April 2016, Pupo visited several urolo-\ngists and gynecologists with complaints of urinary incontinence.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633      Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 6 of 24\n\n\n\n\n6                     Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\nDuring these visits Pupo complained that she had to wear five pads\na day, her doctors noted that she had a prolapsed bladder, and her\nsymptoms were not responding well to medication.\n       In addition to records on her physical impairments, Pupo\nalso submitted records about her psychological impairments. In\n2011, Pupo was diagnosed with major depressive disorder after\ncompleting a psychiatric evaluation. From May 2011 to February\n2014, she visited a psychiatrist, Dr. Rosa Amurrio, regularly for\ntreatment. Dr. Amurrio prescribed Pupo a variety of medications\nfor her mental disorders. Pupo was briefly committed to inpatient\ntreatment for one week after she told Dr. Amurrio that she had\nhallucinations and suicidal ideation. However, she later denied\nhaving had these symptoms after being discharged. During her\nregular visits, Dr. Amurrio reported that Pupo was casually\ndressed, had good eye contact and fluent speech, and was oriented.\nHer mood had improved slightly, but she still experienced forget-\nfulness, lack of energy, and anxiety. Pupo had complained of anxi-\nety and depression after running out of her medications but re-\nported that she had an improved mood and was doing much better\nwhile taking medications.\n        In July 2012, Dr. Amurrio completed a psychiatric and psy-\nchosocial evaluation of Pupo. She diagnosed Pupo with major de-\npressive disorder and severe and generalized anxiety disorder. Dr.\nAmurrio had not placed or requested any limitations on Pupo\u2019s ac-\ntivities. Her impairments were likely to produce good and bad\ndays because her decreased mood could cause bad days. She\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633         Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 7 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                          7\n\nsuffered from depressive syndrome with the following clinical fea-\ntures: anhedonia; appetite disturbance with change in weight; dif-\nficulty concentrating or difficulty thinking; hallucinations, delu-\nsions, or paranoid thinking, and feelings of guilt or worthlessness.\nPupo\u2019s condition did not result in a complete inability to function\nindependently outside of her home.\n        Next, Dr. Amurrio reported that Pupo had the following re-\nstrictions for work-related mental activities: mild restrictions in car-\nrying out short, simple instructions; moderate restrictions in un-\nderstanding and remembering detailed instructions; moderate re-\nstrictions in carrying out detailed instructions; and mild restrictions\nin the ability to make judgments on simple work-related decisions.\nPupo also had mild restrictions for interacting appropriately with\ncoworkers and marked restrictions for responding appropriately to\nwork pressures and changes in a usual work setting.\n       II. The ALJ Hearing and Decision\n       Pupo had an ALJ hearing in April 2016. She testified that she\nwas 54-years old and born in Cuba. She could not communicate in\nEnglish, and could not work due to depression, pain in her left clav-\nicle and left leg, diabetes, high blood pressure, and urinary inconti-\nnence. Her only work experience was a six-month stint in 2007\u201308\ncleaning construction homes. She testified that she could stand or\nwalk for forty-five minutes to an hour, could sit for about an hour\nbefore feeling increased pain, and could lift twenty pounds without\nfeeling an increase in pain. She did not do any housework, had\ndifficulty dressing herself because of her left arm pain, occasionally\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 8 of 24\n\n\n\n\n8                      Opinion of the Court                19-14633\n\nwent grocery shopping with her husband, read the Bible for ten\nminutes per day, and needed her husband to remind her to take her\nmedications. A vocational expert (VE) also testified about hypo-\nthetical individuals with Pupo\u2019s age, education, and past work ex-\nperience who could perform work at the medium exertional level\nand found that there were three jobs that she could do: industrial\ncleaner, laundry worker, and hand packager.\n       The ALJ issued a decision in August 2016 which concluded\nthat Pupo was not disabled. The ALJ made the following findings:\n    \u2022 At Step One of the sequential analysis, Pupo had not en-\n      gaged in substantial gainful activity since her application for\n      benefits.\n    \u2022 At Step Two, Pupo had numerous severe impairments: ma-\n      jor depressive disorder, hypertension, hypothyroidism, dia-\n      betes type II, and obesity.\n    \u2022 At Step Three, Pupo did not have an impairment or combi-\n      nation of impairments that met or medically equaled the se-\n      verity of one of the listed impairments (a Listing) in 20 C.F.R\n      Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n    \u2022 Pupo had the RFC to perform medium work except that she\n      was limited to work that requires her to remember and im-\n      plement simple instructions, have occasional contact with\n      coworkers, and no contact with the general public. In mak-\n      ing this determination, the ALJ noted that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s\n      statements concerning the intensity, persistence and\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 9 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633              Opinion of the Court                        9\n\n      limiting effects of [her] symptoms are not entirely consistent\n      with the medical evidence and other evidence in the rec-\n      ord.\u201d\n   \u2022 At Step Four, Pupo had no past relevant work.\n   \u2022 At Step Five, there were jobs that existed in significant num-\n     bers in the national economy that Pupo could perform, con-\n     sidering her age, education, work experience, and RFC.\n   \u2022 Accordingly, the ALJ found that Pupo was \u201cnot disabled.\u201d\n       Notably, the ALJ did not identify Pupo\u2019s stress urinary in-\ncontinence as one of her severe impairments at Step Two and did\nnot address the effect of her stress urinary incontinence on her\nphysical abilities at Step Four. The ALJ\u2019s Step Four finding that\nPupo had the RFC to perform \u201cmedium work\u201d meant that she\ncould, among other things, lift up to fifty pounds at a time and\ncould frequently lift and carry up to twenty-five pounds. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.967(d). In making this RFC assessment, the ALJ \u201cas-\nsign[ed] minimal weight\u201d to the opinion of Dr. Diaz, Pupo\u2019s treat-\ning physician, in his RFC questionnaire.

On the day the ALJ issued his decision,\nPupo was 66 days shy of her 55th birthday, which would have\nplaced her in the \u201cadvanced age\u201d category. Thus, Pupo contends\nthat this case involves a borderline age situation.\n       We have yet to address the borderline age situation in a pub-\nlished opinion. The relevant regulation provides that the Commis-\nsioner:\n      will not apply the age categories mechanically in a\n      borderline situation. If [the claimant is] within a few\n      days to a few months of reaching an older age cate-\n      gory, and using the older age category would result\n      in a determination or decision that [the claimant is]\n      disabled, [the Commissioner] will consider whether\n      to use the older age category after evaluating the\n      overall impact of all the factors of [the claimant\u2019s]\n      case.\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(b).\n      At the outset, we reject the Commissioner\u2019s argument that\nPupo was required to offer additional evidence that the older age\ncategory should apply in a borderline age situation. The Commis-\nsioner cites to our rule in Reeves in support of its argument.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 15 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                        15\n\nHowever, Reeves is distinguishable because it did not concern a\nborderline age situation.

Thus, not only are the facts in Reeves not directly on point\nhere but applying it in borderline age situations would be incon-\nsistent with the language of the regulation.\n       Nevertheless, we agree with the Commissioner that the ALJ\ndid not err in this case because he did not rely solely on the grids in\nmaking his disability determination. The whole crux of the bor-\nderline age regulation is that the Commissioner will not apply the\nage categories, i.e., the grids, mechanically. We agree that the ALJ\ncould not have erred in failing to consider the borderline age situa-\ntion because he did not apply the grids mechanically in this case,\nbut instead relied on VE testimony due to Pupo\u2019s non-exertional\nlimitations.\n       This is consistent with other circuits that have considered\nthe borderline age situation.

This is consistent with the regulations and our\nprecedent for the proper analysis at Step Five. Accordingly, the ALJ\ndid not err by not addressing the borderline age situation and sub-\nstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision in this regard.\n       II.

This new evidence showed that her stress in-\ncontinence was in fact severe and serious enough to require sur-\ngery. At the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision, the medical evidence in the\nrecord indicated that, after more conservative medication treat-\nment for her stress incontinence had failed, Pupo\u2019s urologist and\n\n\n\n3 In 2016, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) was amended, effective January 17, 2017,\nbut with compliance not required until May 1, 2017.

The new version\nof \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) added the requirement that the new evidence show a rea-\nsonable probability of a different outcome before the Appeals Council will re-\nview the new evidence. Prior to this change, our precedent interpreted the\nterm \u201cmaterial\u201d in \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) to require the new evidence to show a rea-\nsonable possibility of a different outcome.

Because the\nparties do not dispute that the new version of \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5) applies to\nPupo\u2019s new evidence, we assume, without deciding, that it does.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633      Date Filed: 11/03/2021     Page: 18 of 24\n\n\n\n\n18                     Opinion of the Court               19-14633\n\ngynecologists began discussing with her a possible surgical treat-\nment. However, no surgery had ever been performed.\n        These new medical records showing Pupo in fact had sur-\ngery for her stress incontinence constitute new and material evi-\ndence that had a reasonable probability of changing the outcome\nof the decision. This is particularly true when considered with the\nALJ\u2019s findings at Step Four that Pupo had never been hospitalized\nfor any of her physical impairments and that her doctors\u2019 physical\ntreatment notes had been \u201cconsistently unremarkable.\u201d Both of\nthese findings now appear to be inaccurate with respect to her\nstress incontinence when these new records are considered.\n       These now-evident factual errors are compounded by the\nfact that, at Step Four, the ALJ did not adequately consider the ef-\nfects of Pupo\u2019s stress incontinence on her ability to perform me-\ndium work, especially the lifting requirements, as discussed below.\nConsidering this new objective medical evidence bearing on the\nseverity of her stress incontinence, a factfinder could reasonably\nconclude that Pupo could not have lifted up to fifty pounds at a\ntime or frequently lifted and carried objects weighing up to twenty-\nfive pounds during the relevant time period. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s\nhypothetical question to the vocational expert asked only about\nmedium work with no lifting restrictions. Given the foregoing, the\nAppeals Council erred in concluding that this new evidence failed\nto show a reasonable probability of a different outcome. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(a)(5). Because the Appeals Council failed to\nproperly consider this new evidence submitted by Pupo, we\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633       Date Filed: 11/03/2021    Page: 19 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633               Opinion of the Court                       19\n\nremand for consideration of Pupo\u2019s disability eligibility based on\nthe total record.\n      III.

Id. \u00a7 416.945(a). The ALJ makes this determina-\ntion by considering the claimant\u2019s ability to lift and carry weight,\nsit, stand, push, pull, walk, etc., as well as the claimant\u2019s mental\nabilities. Id. \u00a7 416.945(b)\u2013(c). The claimant\u2019s RFC is then used to\ndetermine her capability of performing various designated levels of\nwork (sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy). See id.\n\u00a7 416.967.

Although the mental impairments were\nnon-severe, the ALJ was still required to consider them when as-\nsessing the claimant\u2019s RFC. Id. Since the ALJ provided no assess-\nment on the claimant\u2019s mental impairments, we found the ALJ\u2019s\noverall assessment of the claimant\u2019s RFC to be inadequate. Id. at\n1270.\n       Similarly, here, although the ALJ stated he \u201cconsidered all\nsymptoms,\u201d his decision demonstrates that he did not. The ALJ\ndid not consider Pupo\u2019s stress urinary incontinence when he con-\nducted his RFC assessment. He noted that she had been treated for\nincontinence in his decision but did not discuss how her inconti-\nnence would impact her ability to perform work at the medium\nlevel, especially how it would affect her ability to lift and carry\nweight. This is particularly troubling given that the record shows\nthat Pupo saw numerous gynecologists and a urologist about her\n\fUSCA11 Case: 19-14633        Date Filed: 11/03/2021      Page: 21 of 24\n\n\n\n\n19-14633                Opinion of the Court                         21\n\nincontinence and uterine prolapse; she complained about inconti-\nnence to multiple providers, noting that she had to wear five pads\na day; she was referred to have surgery in 2014 but was unable to\nreceive medical clearance; she complained of incontinence when\ncoughing or lifting weight; she had a positive cough test; and treat-\nment through medication had failed.\n       Like the ALJ in Schink, the ALJ here was required to con-\nsider all of Pupo\u2019s impairments, severe or not, when evaluating her\nRFC. The ALJ did this for Pupo\u2019s other impairments, such as back\npain, obesity, and depression, but failed to mention any impact that\nher incontinence might have had on her RFC during the relevant\ntime period.\n        It is also worth noting that the ALJ did not rely on any opin-\nion evidence from a medical doctor regarding Pupo\u2019s physical abil-\nities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and carrying, in de-\ntermining her RFC.\n       To be sure, an ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is an administrative\nfinding based on all the relevant evidence, including both medical\nand nonmedical evidence.

Moreover, the ALJ has a duty to \u201cmake every\nreasonable effort to ensure that the file contains sufficient evidence\nto assess RFC.\u201d SSR 96-8p, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">61 Fed.

We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.\n\n\n                                                  BACKGROUND\n       Appellant was indicted for two counts of injury to a child. As to both counts, the indictment\nalleged that Appellant intentionally or knowingly seriously injured A.F. by shaking her, throwing\nher, or causing her bassinette to fall over. Count one alleged that Appellant committed an offense\non or about June 26, 2018, through August 14, 2018, and count two alleged that Appellant\ncommitted an offense on or about August 15, 2018, through August 16, 2018.\n       In a pretrial motion to suppress his confession, Appellant asserted that he was unable to\nwaive his Miranda 2 rights intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily because he suffers from an\nintellectual developmental disability (\u201cIDD\u201d). Appellant included as an exhibit to his motion a\n\n       1\n           Appellant waived his right to a jury trial as to both guilt-innocence and punishment.\n       2\n           See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).\n\freport from Dr. Patricia Plasay, a licensed forensic psychologist with Forensic and Clinical\nPsychology Center in Tyler. In her report, Plasay concluded that Appellant meets the criteria for\na diagnosis of IDD, and she determined that Appellant \u201cevidence[s] significant deficits in both\nintellectual and adaptive functioning\u201d and has \u201ca difficult time understanding complex, multi-step\ninstructions.\u201d\n       At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Special Agent Rusty Hughes with the Texas\nDepartment of Safety Criminal Investigation Division testified that on June 24, 2019, he conducted\na custodial interview of Appellant after the Rusk Police Department asked him to assist with the\ninvestigation. Before interviewing Appellant, Hughes read Appellant his Miranda rights. Hughes\ntestified that he never coerced or threatened Appellant and did not deny Appellant any necessities.\nHughes explained that he conducted a polygraph examination of Appellant, which consisted of\nfour parts: the pre-test interview, data collection, data analysis, and post-test interview. According\nto Hughes, Appellant responded appropriately to questions and was able to follow a timeline.\nHughes testified that Appellant initially acted as though he did not know how A.F. was injured,\nand he blamed others.\n       After administering the polygraph examination to Appellant and scoring it, Hughes\nbelieved Appellant was being deceptive regarding the questions about A.F., and he informed\nAppellant of the results of the examination. Hughes explained that during the interview he\nconducted after the polygraph examination, Appellant \u201coriginally started right back where he was,\ndenying it, and it took a little while for him to finally decide to talk about what had happened\nbetween him and [A.F.].\u201d Appellant eventually told Hughes that he had thrown A.F. onto the bed\nand apologized to her afterward. As the interview progressed, Appellant admitted that he shook\nA.F. and spun A.F.\u2019s bassinette because he lost his temper. According to Hughes, Appellant did\nnot show any signs of an intellectual disability during the interview. Hughes testified that\nAppellant comprehended what Hughes was saying, and \u201chis responses were quick.\u201d\n       Dr. Plasay testified that defense counsel asked her to evaluate whether Appellant has an\nintellectual disability. In performing her evaluation, Plasay reviewed Appellant\u2019s court records,\nmedical and psychiatric records, lease, school records, three interrogations of Appellant, and\ncollateral information provided by defense counsel, and her report was admitted into evidence.\nPlasay also interviewed Appellant\u2019s parents, and she interviewed Appellant for three hours. Plasay\nconcluded that Appellant has IDD, which she explained is \u201cdefined as significant deficits in\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fintellectual and adaptive functioning that are present during the formative years of development,\nmeaning prior to age 18.\u201d Plasay stated that individuals who suffer from IDD have a lower IQ\nthan 98% of the population. Plasay testified that Appellant \u201chas a well-established, extensive\npsychiatric history dating back to his early childhood[,]\u201d and Appellant \u201chad marked behavioral\nand academic problems\u201d in school and at home. According to Plasay, Access MHMR diagnosed\nAppellant with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder, generalized anxiety\ndisorder, major depressive disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning.\n       Dr. Plasay explained that Appellant\u2019s IDD is mild, which means that Appellant has\nsufficient speech, can hold a reciprocal conversation, and can learn, but he needs modifications.\nAccording to Plasay, Appellant\u2019s estimated mental age is twelve years old, and his IQ is 70. Plasay\ntestified that individuals who suffer from IDD are highly suggestible, and \u201c[t]hey can be unduly\ninfluenced and defer to authority in some situations.\u201d Plasay explained that individuals with IDD\n\u201chave an elevated risk of internalizing the suggestions of the interrogator.\u201d Plasay stated that she\ndid not evaluate Appellant\u2019s comprehension of the Miranda warnings. When asked whether\nAppellant\u2019s level of verbal impairment would significantly impact his ability to understand a\nMiranda warning, Plasay stated that it is the trial judge\u2019s role to make that determination, and she\nexplained, \u201cAll I can say is that based on the findings, he would struggle more than the average\nperson.\u201d Plasay described Appellant\u2019s ability to understand and comprehend verbal information\nas \u201csignificantly impaired[,]\u201d and she characterized his understanding during the interview by\nSpecial Agent Hughes as \u201c[l]imited.\u201d         Plasay opined that Appellant was confused and\noverwhelmed during the interview, and she testified that Appellant appeared to struggle with\ndirections and did not fully understand everything that was asked of him. According to Plasay,\npeople with IDD are more prone to giving false confessions, and she opined that Appellant falls\ninto that category.\n       During cross-examination, Plasay testified that she did not ask Appellant whether he\nunderstood the Miranda warning, and she did not assess his ability to understand it. Plasay stated,\n\u201cI can\u2019t render an opinion on an evaluation I didn\u2019t conduct.\u201d Plasay explained that a diagnosis of\nIDD does not preclude someone from understanding a Miranda warning. Plasay agreed that the\nonly time Appellant appeared to be emotionally overwhelmed was when he was confessing to\nthrowing A.F. onto the bed and shaking her. In addition, Plasay testified that she obtained all the\ninformation for her evaluation from defense counsel, and she admitted that if more records exist,\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fher opinion might change. Plasay explained that two previous assessments conducted during\nAppellant\u2019s school years concluded that Appellant does not suffer from IDD, but when Appellant\nwas in school, he had \u201csignificant problems that required special education.\u201d Plasay explained that\nshe was not testifying that Appellant\u2019s confession was false or coerced, and when asked whether\nhis confession could have been voluntary and based upon a knowing and intelligent waiver of his\nrights, she stated that it \u201ccould have been.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to suppress.\n       At trial, Dr. Elizabeth Peeler testified that she is a physician in the REACH clinic of UT\nSouthwestern and Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas, where she evaluates patients in cases of\nsuspected child abuse or neglect. Peeler explained that A.F. suffered from abusive head trauma,\nformerly referred to as \u201cshaken baby syndrome,\u201d when she was seven weeks old. According to\nPeeler, A.F. was a normal, healthy baby until August 15, 2018, when she was found unresponsive\nand not breathing. Upon examining A.F., Peeler discovered that the fontanelle at the top of A.F.\u2019s\nhead was full and bulging, which Peeler explained is a sign of increased pressure in the brain. Dr.\nPeeler testified that a CT scan revealed that A.F. had bilateral subdural hematomas, which \u201chad a\ndifferent appearance [than] the blood that appeared newer on CT scan, which was located in both\nof the temples on the back of the brain.\u201d Peeler testified that because A.F. did not have a skull\nfracture, her \u201cacceleration-deceleration whiplash\u201d injuries must have resulted from \u201ca shaking-\ntype mechanism[,]\u201d such as shaking back and forth, shaking and slamming, or shaking and tossing.\n       According to Peeler, a chest X-ray revealed that A.F. also had a left first rib fracture, which\nwas already in the healing stages. Peeler explained that because it takes seven to ten days for bone\nhealing to be identifiable on x-rays, A.F.\u2019s rib fracture must have occurred at least seven days\nearlier. Peeler testified that A.F. also suffered from five retinal hemorrhages in her left eye, which\nwere caused by the same type of acceleration-deceleration whiplash mechanism. According to\nPeeler, none of A.F.\u2019s family members provided any history of dropping her, and a brain bleed\nfrom a fall \u201cwould not be diffuse and bilateral\u201d and would not cause such significant symptoms.\nPeeler explained that A.F. could have received her acceleration-deceleration injuries from being\nthrown onto the top of a bed because such an event \u201ccauses the brain to whiplash back and forth\non the inside.\u201d\n       Peeler testified that A.F. required two neurosurgical procedures: (1) inserting a needle into\nher fontanelle to relieve the pressure, and (2) drilling a burr hole into her skull after the needle\nprocedure did not fully relieve the pressure. A.F. also required a blood transfusion. According to\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fPeeler, an MRI scan indicated that the left frontal part of A.F.\u2019s brain had begun to atrophy due to\n\u201c[a] significant trauma\u201d that resulted in a lack of nutrients to the brain. Peeler explained that A.F.\u2019s\ninjuries created a substantial risk of death, and A.F. required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a\nblood transfusion and multiple procedures, and had to be transferred to two pediatric hospitals.\nAccording to Peeler, A.F. suffered two instances of abusive head trauma, and both the older brain\nbleed and the newer brain bleed were injuries that carry a substantial risk of death. Peeler estimated\nthat A.F.\u2019s newer brain bleed occurred forty-eight hours before she was seen at Trinity Frances\nHospital on August 16, 2018, and the older brain bleed occurred sometime after her birth but before\nthe newer brain bleed. A.F. had to be readmitted to the hospital two times due to complications\nfrom seizures, and A.F. has required occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy,\nand she requires medications to control her seizures. Peeler explained that A.F. suffered long-term\neffects from her injuries, and A.F. will \u201cremain challenged for the rest of her life.\u201d\n        Officer Michael Goff testified that on August 16, 2018, he responded to an apartment in\nRusk, where A.F. was lying on the floor and a man was performing CPR on her. According to\nGoff, Appellant stayed outside, and Appellant \u201cjust seemed angry more than anything.\u201d Nicholas\nCastle, a Texas Ranger with the Texas Department of Public Safety, testified that in August 2018,\nthe Rusk Police Department asked him to assist with the investigation regarding A.F.\u2019s injuries.\nRanger Castle explained that he assisted the police with interviewing witnesses, and he eventually\nconducted a non-custodial interview of Appellant. Castle testified that Appellant responded\npromptly and appropriately during the interview, and a video recording of the interview was\nadmitted into evidence. Castle opined that Appellant was being untruthful regarding A.F.\u2019s\ninjuries. Appellant ended the interview after informing Castle that he wanted an attorney.\n        Special Agent Hughes testified that he conducted a video-recorded custodial interview of\nAppellant in June 2019. Special Agent Hughes explained that he advised Appellant of his Miranda\nrights before the interview began, and Appellant agreed to speak with him. The video recording\nwas admitted into evidence over defense counsel\u2019s objection that Appellant did not intelligently,\nvoluntarily, or knowingly waive his Miranda rights. Hughes testified that he would have used\ndeception to facilitate obtaining a confession from Appellant even if he had known that Appellant\nmight suffer from IDD. Jonathan Fails, who lived in the same apartment complex as Appellant,\ntestified that on one occasion, he saw Appellant shake A.F. Chief Stephen Hughes of the Rusk\nPolice Department testified that he participated in Special Agent Hughes\u2019s interview of Appellant,\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fand he explained that during the interview, Appellant confessed to throwing A.F. onto the bed,\nhitting or kicking her bassinette, and shaking A.F. because she would not be quiet. Chief Hughes\ntestified that Appellant did not appear to be mentally deficient, and he stated that Appellant could\nunderstand and answer the questions he was asked.\n         As discussed above, the trial court found Appellant guilty as to both counts and sentenced\nAppellant to fifty years of confinement on each count. The trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s\nsentences would run concurrently. This appeal followed.\n\n\n       DENIAL OF MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND ADMISSION OF CONFESSION INTO EVIDENCE\n         In issue one, Appellant complains of the denial of his motion to suppress his confession,\nand in issue two, Appellant challenges the admission of his confession into evidence as to both\ncharged counts. Because issues one and two are related, we address them together. 3\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n         We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard. Hubert\nv. State, 312 S.W.3d 554, 559 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 327\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We give almost total deference to the trial court\u2019s determination of\nhistorical facts and mixed questions of law and fact that rely on credibility determinations if they\nare supported by the record. State v. Kerwick, 393 S.W.3d 270, 273 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013);\nGuzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). However, we review de novo\nquestions of law and mixed questions of law and fact that do not rely on credibility determinations.\nKerwick, 393 S.W.3d at 273. When, as here, a trial court does not make written findings explaining\nthe factual basis for its decision, we imply findings of fact that support the trial court\u2019s ruling if\nthe evidence supports those implied findings. Meekins v. State, 340 S.W.3d 454, 460 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2011). At a hearing on the motion to suppress, the trial court is the exclusive trier of fact and\njudge of the credibility of the witnesses. Maxwell v. State, 73 S.W.3d 278, 281 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2002). A trial court may choose to believe or to disbelieve all or any part of a witness\u2019s testimony.\nState v. Ross, 32 S.W.3d 853, 855 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We must uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling\n\n\n\n         3\n          Ordinarily, we would address issues three and four first because, if sustained, they would result in rendition\nof a judgment of acquittal. See Price v. State, 502 S.W.3d 278, 281 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, no pet.);\nsee also TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1. However, because Appellant argues in issues three and four that we must not consider\nevidence of his confession because such evidence was improperly admitted, we will address issues one and two first.\n\n\n                                                           6\n\fon a motion to suppress if the ruling is supported by the record and is correct under any theory of\nlaw applicable to the case. Armendariz v. State, 123 S.W.3d 401, 404 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n       We review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of evidence under an abuse\nof discretion standard. Johnson v. State, 490 S.W.3d 895, 908 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016). We will\nuphold the trial court\u2019s ruling if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement. See Gonzalez\nv. State, 544 S.W.3d 363, 370 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018); Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d 727, 736\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (op.\non reh\u2019g).\n       Article 38.21 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides that statements made by\na person accused of a crime \u201cmay be used in evidence against him if it appears that the same w[ere]\nfreely and voluntarily made without compulsion or persuasion[.]\u201d TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN.\nart. 38.21 (West 2005). A person\u2019s mental deficiency alone is not determinative in ascertaining\nthe voluntariness of a confession and the waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. Penry v. State, 903 S.W.2d 715, 744 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); Smith v. State, 779\nS.W.2d 417, 429 n.8 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989); see Casias v. State, 452 S.W.2d 483, 488 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1970) (holding that confession was admissible even though defendant had an IQ of 68,\nwas illiterate, and had a mental age of eight to ten years); Grayson v. State, 438 S.W.2d 553, 555\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1969) (concluding that statements from a defendant who had an IQ of 51 and a\nmental age of six years were admissible). Rather, in determining whether a confession was\nvoluntarily made, courts must examine the totality of the circumstances. Delao v. State, 235\nS.W.3d 235, 239 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citing Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 285-86,\n111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991)). Accordingly, \u201can accused\u2019s mentality is but one factor\namong many to consider when evaluating the voluntariness of a confession.\u201d Id. at 240 (citing\nBizzarri v. State, 492 S.W.2d 944, 946 (Tex. Crim. App. 1973)). The totality-of-the-circumstances\nstandard is sufficiently all-encompassing to protect a defendant\u2019s rights, taking into account such\nfactors as intelligence, age, experience, and maturity. Id. at 241. Because mental capabilities are\nmerely one factor to be evaluated among many, \u201cthis measure of voluntariness may be applicable\nto confessions made by anyone, no matter what [his] IQ happens to be.\u201d Id.\nAnalysis\n       At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the trial judge heard Special Agent Hughes testify\nthat Appellant responded appropriately to questions and was able to follow a timeline. The trial\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fjudge also viewed the video recording of Hughes\u2019s questioning of Appellant. In addition, the trial\njudge heard Dr. Plasay testify that Appellant\u2019s mild IDD placed him in a category of individuals\nwho have an elevated risk of internalizing the suggestions of the person interrogating them and\ngiving false confessions. The trial judge also heard Plasay testify that she did not evaluate whether\nAppellant understood the Miranda warning, and that a diagnosis of IDD does not preclude\nsomeone from understanding the Miranda warning. Moreover, the trial judge heard evidence that\ntwo prior evaluations of Appellant did not result in a diagnosis of IDD.\n        Based upon our review of the record and considering the totality of the circumstances\nrelated to Appellant\u2019s confession, we conclude that the trial court did not err by concluding that\nAppellant was capable of voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights and did so. See Kerwick, 393\nS.W.3d at 273; Meekins, 340 S.W.3d at 460; Armendariz, 123 S.W.3d at 404; Ross, 32 S.W.3d at\n855; see also TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.21. We also conclude that the trial court\ncorrectly determined that Appellant\u2019s confession was made voluntarily despite any intellectual\ndeficiencies. See Delao, 235 S.W.3d at 239-41; Penry, 903 S.W.3d at 744; Smith, 779 S.W.2d at\n429 n.8; see also Casias, 452 S.W.2d at 488; Grayson, 438 S.W.3d at 555. Furthermore, we\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the video recording of\nAppellant\u2019s confession into evidence and allowing testimony regarding Appellant\u2019s confession.\nSee Johnson, 490 S.W.3d at 908; Gonzalez, 544 S.W.3d at 370; Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 391.\nFor all these reasons, we overrule issues one and two.\n\n\n                                      SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n        In issue three, Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction\non count one, and in issue four, Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his\nconviction on count two. 4 Specifically, Appellant asserts that when his confession is removed\nfrom consideration, the evidence is insufficient. We address issues three and four together.\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n        In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we review all the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found the\nessential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893,\n\n\n        4\n          Appellant discusses both legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence in his brief. However, we only apply\nthe Jackson v. Virginia standard. See Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n\n                                                         8\n\f902 n.19 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781,\n61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)); Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \u201cThe trial\njudge, when sitting as the sole trier of facts, is the exclusive judge of the credibility of the witnesses\nand the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d Joseph v. State, 897 S.W.2d 374, 376 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1995). The factfinder is the ultimate authority on the credibility of witnesses and the weight\nto be given their testimony. Penagraph v. State, 623 S.W.2d 341, 343 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel\nOp.] 1981). We defer to the trial court\u2019s responsibility to resolve any conflicts in the evidence, to\nweigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Isassi v.\nState, 330 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Clayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2007).\n        To meet its burden of proof, the State was required to prove that Appellant intentionally or\nknowingly caused serious bodily injury to A.F., as charged in the indictment. See TEX. PENAL\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 22.04(a) (West 2019). The Texas Penal Code defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as a\n\u201cbodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent\ndisfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 1.07(a)(46) (West 2021). Because injury to a child is a \u201cresult-oriented\u201d or \u201cresult of\nconduct\u201d offense, the culpable mental state relates to the result of the charged conduct rather than\nthe nature or circumstances surrounding the charged conduct, and the defendant must have\nengaged in the conduct with the required culpability to cause the result. Haggins v. State, 785\nS.W.2d 827, 828 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); Patterson v. State, 46 S.W.3d 294, 301 (Tex. App.\u2014\nFort Worth 2001, pet. ref\u2019d). A person acts intentionally \u201cwhen it is his conscious objective or\ndesire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 6.03(a) (West\n2021). A person acts knowingly \u201cwhen he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause\nthe result.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6.03(b). Proof of a culpable mental state generally relies upon circumstantial\nevidence, and it ordinarily must be inferred from the accused\u2019s acts, words, conduct, and the\nsurrounding circumstances. Moore v. State, 154 S.W.3d 703, 712 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2004,\npet. ref\u2019d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fAnalysis\n         The trial court heard evidence that Appellant confessed to throwing A.F. onto the bed,\nshaking her, and spinning her bassinette because she would not be quiet and he lost his temper. 5\nIn addition, the trial court heard evidence that A.F. suffered from abusive head trauma on two\noccasions, as well as a rib fracture that occurred at least seven days before she was admitted to the\nhospital. The trial court further heard evidence that A.F. required two neurosurgical procedures,\nboth of her head injuries created a substantial risk of death, and A.F. needed occupational therapy,\nspeech therapy, and physical therapy. The trial court also heard evidence that A.F. required\nmedication to control her seizures, and A.F. would face challenges for the rest of her life.\nFurthermore, the trial court heard Fails testify that he saw Appellant shake A.F. Viewing all the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s finding and deferring to the trial court\u2019s\nexclusive role in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony,\nwe conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Appellant\nintentionally or knowingly caused serious bodily injury to A.F., as charged in counts one and two\nof the indictment. See Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 902 n.19; Penagraph, 623 S.W.2d at 343; Haggins,\n785 S.W.2d at 828; Moore, 154 S.W.3d at 712; Patterson, 46 S.W.3d at 301; see also TEX.

We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.\n\n\n                                                  BACKGROUND\n       Appellant was indicted for two counts of injury to a child. As to both counts, the indictment\nalleged that Appellant intentionally or knowingly seriously injured A.F. by shaking her, throwing\nher, or causing her bassinette to fall over. Count one alleged that Appellant committed an offense\non or about June 26, 2018, through August 14, 2018, and count two alleged that Appellant\ncommitted an offense on or about August 15, 2018, through August 16, 2018.\n       In a pretrial motion to suppress his confession, Appellant asserted that he was unable to\nwaive his Miranda 2 rights intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily because he suffers from an\nintellectual developmental disability (\u201cIDD\u201d). Appellant included as an exhibit to his motion a\n\n       1\n           Appellant waived his right to a jury trial as to both guilt-innocence and punishment.\n       2\n           See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).\n\freport from Dr. Patricia Plasay, a licensed forensic psychologist with Forensic and Clinical\nPsychology Center in Tyler. In her report, Plasay concluded that Appellant meets the criteria for\na diagnosis of IDD, and she determined that Appellant \u201cevidence[s] significant deficits in both\nintellectual and adaptive functioning\u201d and has \u201ca difficult time understanding complex, multi-step\ninstructions.\u201d\n       At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Special Agent Rusty Hughes with the Texas\nDepartment of Safety Criminal Investigation Division testified that on June 24, 2019, he conducted\na custodial interview of Appellant after the Rusk Police Department asked him to assist with the\ninvestigation. Before interviewing Appellant, Hughes read Appellant his Miranda rights. Hughes\ntestified that he never coerced or threatened Appellant and did not deny Appellant any necessities.\nHughes explained that he conducted a polygraph examination of Appellant, which consisted of\nfour parts: the pre-test interview, data collection, data analysis, and post-test interview. According\nto Hughes, Appellant responded appropriately to questions and was able to follow a timeline.\nHughes testified that Appellant initially acted as though he did not know how A.F. was injured,\nand he blamed others.\n       After administering the polygraph examination to Appellant and scoring it, Hughes\nbelieved Appellant was being deceptive regarding the questions about A.F., and he informed\nAppellant of the results of the examination. Hughes explained that during the interview he\nconducted after the polygraph examination, Appellant \u201coriginally started right back where he was,\ndenying it, and it took a little while for him to finally decide to talk about what had happened\nbetween him and [A.F.].\u201d Appellant eventually told Hughes that he had thrown A.F. onto the bed\nand apologized to her afterward. As the interview progressed, Appellant admitted that he shook\nA.F. and spun A.F.\u2019s bassinette because he lost his temper. According to Hughes, Appellant did\nnot show any signs of an intellectual disability during the interview. Hughes testified that\nAppellant comprehended what Hughes was saying, and \u201chis responses were quick.\u201d\n       Dr. Plasay testified that defense counsel asked her to evaluate whether Appellant has an\nintellectual disability. In performing her evaluation, Plasay reviewed Appellant\u2019s court records,\nmedical and psychiatric records, lease, school records, three interrogations of Appellant, and\ncollateral information provided by defense counsel, and her report was admitted into evidence.\nPlasay also interviewed Appellant\u2019s parents, and she interviewed Appellant for three hours. Plasay\nconcluded that Appellant has IDD, which she explained is \u201cdefined as significant deficits in\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fintellectual and adaptive functioning that are present during the formative years of development,\nmeaning prior to age 18.\u201d Plasay stated that individuals who suffer from IDD have a lower IQ\nthan 98% of the population. Plasay testified that Appellant \u201chas a well-established, extensive\npsychiatric history dating back to his early childhood[,]\u201d and Appellant \u201chad marked behavioral\nand academic problems\u201d in school and at home. According to Plasay, Access MHMR diagnosed\nAppellant with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder, generalized anxiety\ndisorder, major depressive disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning.\n       Dr. Plasay explained that Appellant\u2019s IDD is mild, which means that Appellant has\nsufficient speech, can hold a reciprocal conversation, and can learn, but he needs modifications.\nAccording to Plasay, Appellant\u2019s estimated mental age is twelve years old, and his IQ is 70. Plasay\ntestified that individuals who suffer from IDD are highly suggestible, and \u201c[t]hey can be unduly\ninfluenced and defer to authority in some situations.\u201d Plasay explained that individuals with IDD\n\u201chave an elevated risk of internalizing the suggestions of the interrogator.\u201d Plasay stated that she\ndid not evaluate Appellant\u2019s comprehension of the Miranda warnings. When asked whether\nAppellant\u2019s level of verbal impairment would significantly impact his ability to understand a\nMiranda warning, Plasay stated that it is the trial judge\u2019s role to make that determination, and she\nexplained, \u201cAll I can say is that based on the findings, he would struggle more than the average\nperson.\u201d Plasay described Appellant\u2019s ability to understand and comprehend verbal information\nas \u201csignificantly impaired[,]\u201d and she characterized his understanding during the interview by\nSpecial Agent Hughes as \u201c[l]imited.\u201d         Plasay opined that Appellant was confused and\noverwhelmed during the interview, and she testified that Appellant appeared to struggle with\ndirections and did not fully understand everything that was asked of him. According to Plasay,\npeople with IDD are more prone to giving false confessions, and she opined that Appellant falls\ninto that category.\n       During cross-examination, Plasay testified that she did not ask Appellant whether he\nunderstood the Miranda warning, and she did not assess his ability to understand it. Plasay stated,\n\u201cI can\u2019t render an opinion on an evaluation I didn\u2019t conduct.\u201d Plasay explained that a diagnosis of\nIDD does not preclude someone from understanding a Miranda warning. Plasay agreed that the\nonly time Appellant appeared to be emotionally overwhelmed was when he was confessing to\nthrowing A.F. onto the bed and shaking her. In addition, Plasay testified that she obtained all the\ninformation for her evaluation from defense counsel, and she admitted that if more records exist,\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fher opinion might change. Plasay explained that two previous assessments conducted during\nAppellant\u2019s school years concluded that Appellant does not suffer from IDD, but when Appellant\nwas in school, he had \u201csignificant problems that required special education.\u201d Plasay explained that\nshe was not testifying that Appellant\u2019s confession was false or coerced, and when asked whether\nhis confession could have been voluntary and based upon a knowing and intelligent waiver of his\nrights, she stated that it \u201ccould have been.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to suppress.\n       At trial, Dr. Elizabeth Peeler testified that she is a physician in the REACH clinic of UT\nSouthwestern and Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas, where she evaluates patients in cases of\nsuspected child abuse or neglect. Peeler explained that A.F. suffered from abusive head trauma,\nformerly referred to as \u201cshaken baby syndrome,\u201d when she was seven weeks old. According to\nPeeler, A.F. was a normal, healthy baby until August 15, 2018, when she was found unresponsive\nand not breathing. Upon examining A.F., Peeler discovered that the fontanelle at the top of A.F.\u2019s\nhead was full and bulging, which Peeler explained is a sign of increased pressure in the brain. Dr.\nPeeler testified that a CT scan revealed that A.F. had bilateral subdural hematomas, which \u201chad a\ndifferent appearance [than] the blood that appeared newer on CT scan, which was located in both\nof the temples on the back of the brain.\u201d Peeler testified that because A.F. did not have a skull\nfracture, her \u201cacceleration-deceleration whiplash\u201d injuries must have resulted from \u201ca shaking-\ntype mechanism[,]\u201d such as shaking back and forth, shaking and slamming, or shaking and tossing.\n       According to Peeler, a chest X-ray revealed that A.F. also had a left first rib fracture, which\nwas already in the healing stages. Peeler explained that because it takes seven to ten days for bone\nhealing to be identifiable on x-rays, A.F.\u2019s rib fracture must have occurred at least seven days\nearlier. Peeler testified that A.F. also suffered from five retinal hemorrhages in her left eye, which\nwere caused by the same type of acceleration-deceleration whiplash mechanism. According to\nPeeler, none of A.F.\u2019s family members provided any history of dropping her, and a brain bleed\nfrom a fall \u201cwould not be diffuse and bilateral\u201d and would not cause such significant symptoms.\nPeeler explained that A.F. could have received her acceleration-deceleration injuries from being\nthrown onto the top of a bed because such an event \u201ccauses the brain to whiplash back and forth\non the inside.\u201d\n       Peeler testified that A.F. required two neurosurgical procedures: (1) inserting a needle into\nher fontanelle to relieve the pressure, and (2) drilling a burr hole into her skull after the needle\nprocedure did not fully relieve the pressure. A.F. also required a blood transfusion. According to\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fPeeler, an MRI scan indicated that the left frontal part of A.F.\u2019s brain had begun to atrophy due to\n\u201c[a] significant trauma\u201d that resulted in a lack of nutrients to the brain. Peeler explained that A.F.\u2019s\ninjuries created a substantial risk of death, and A.F. required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a\nblood transfusion and multiple procedures, and had to be transferred to two pediatric hospitals.\nAccording to Peeler, A.F. suffered two instances of abusive head trauma, and both the older brain\nbleed and the newer brain bleed were injuries that carry a substantial risk of death. Peeler estimated\nthat A.F.\u2019s newer brain bleed occurred forty-eight hours before she was seen at Trinity Frances\nHospital on August 16, 2018, and the older brain bleed occurred sometime after her birth but before\nthe newer brain bleed. A.F. had to be readmitted to the hospital two times due to complications\nfrom seizures, and A.F. has required occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy,\nand she requires medications to control her seizures. Peeler explained that A.F. suffered long-term\neffects from her injuries, and A.F. will \u201cremain challenged for the rest of her life.\u201d\n        Officer Michael Goff testified that on August 16, 2018, he responded to an apartment in\nRusk, where A.F. was lying on the floor and a man was performing CPR on her. According to\nGoff, Appellant stayed outside, and Appellant \u201cjust seemed angry more than anything.\u201d Nicholas\nCastle, a Texas Ranger with the Texas Department of Public Safety, testified that in August 2018,\nthe Rusk Police Department asked him to assist with the investigation regarding A.F.\u2019s injuries.\nRanger Castle explained that he assisted the police with interviewing witnesses, and he eventually\nconducted a non-custodial interview of Appellant. Castle testified that Appellant responded\npromptly and appropriately during the interview, and a video recording of the interview was\nadmitted into evidence. Castle opined that Appellant was being untruthful regarding A.F.\u2019s\ninjuries. Appellant ended the interview after informing Castle that he wanted an attorney.\n        Special Agent Hughes testified that he conducted a video-recorded custodial interview of\nAppellant in June 2019. Special Agent Hughes explained that he advised Appellant of his Miranda\nrights before the interview began, and Appellant agreed to speak with him. The video recording\nwas admitted into evidence over defense counsel\u2019s objection that Appellant did not intelligently,\nvoluntarily, or knowingly waive his Miranda rights. Hughes testified that he would have used\ndeception to facilitate obtaining a confession from Appellant even if he had known that Appellant\nmight suffer from IDD. Jonathan Fails, who lived in the same apartment complex as Appellant,\ntestified that on one occasion, he saw Appellant shake A.F. Chief Stephen Hughes of the Rusk\nPolice Department testified that he participated in Special Agent Hughes\u2019s interview of Appellant,\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fand he explained that during the interview, Appellant confessed to throwing A.F. onto the bed,\nhitting or kicking her bassinette, and shaking A.F. because she would not be quiet. Chief Hughes\ntestified that Appellant did not appear to be mentally deficient, and he stated that Appellant could\nunderstand and answer the questions he was asked.\n         As discussed above, the trial court found Appellant guilty as to both counts and sentenced\nAppellant to fifty years of confinement on each count. The trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s\nsentences would run concurrently. This appeal followed.\n\n\n       DENIAL OF MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND ADMISSION OF CONFESSION INTO EVIDENCE\n         In issue one, Appellant complains of the denial of his motion to suppress his confession,\nand in issue two, Appellant challenges the admission of his confession into evidence as to both\ncharged counts. Because issues one and two are related, we address them together. 3\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n         We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard. Hubert\nv. State, 312 S.W.3d 554, 559 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 327\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We give almost total deference to the trial court\u2019s determination of\nhistorical facts and mixed questions of law and fact that rely on credibility determinations if they\nare supported by the record. State v. Kerwick, 393 S.W.3d 270, 273 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013);\nGuzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). However, we review de novo\nquestions of law and mixed questions of law and fact that do not rely on credibility determinations.\nKerwick, 393 S.W.3d at 273. When, as here, a trial court does not make written findings explaining\nthe factual basis for its decision, we imply findings of fact that support the trial court\u2019s ruling if\nthe evidence supports those implied findings. Meekins v. State, 340 S.W.3d 454, 460 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2011). At a hearing on the motion to suppress, the trial court is the exclusive trier of fact and\njudge of the credibility of the witnesses. Maxwell v. State, 73 S.W.3d 278, 281 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2002). A trial court may choose to believe or to disbelieve all or any part of a witness\u2019s testimony.\nState v. Ross, 32 S.W.3d 853, 855 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We must uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling\n\n\n\n         3\n          Ordinarily, we would address issues three and four first because, if sustained, they would result in rendition\nof a judgment of acquittal. See Price v. State, 502 S.W.3d 278, 281 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, no pet.);\nsee also TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1. However, because Appellant argues in issues three and four that we must not consider\nevidence of his confession because such evidence was improperly admitted, we will address issues one and two first.\n\n\n                                                           6\n\fon a motion to suppress if the ruling is supported by the record and is correct under any theory of\nlaw applicable to the case. Armendariz v. State, 123 S.W.3d 401, 404 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n       We review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of evidence under an abuse\nof discretion standard. Johnson v. State, 490 S.W.3d 895, 908 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016). We will\nuphold the trial court\u2019s ruling if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement. See Gonzalez\nv. State, 544 S.W.3d 363, 370 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018); Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d 727, 736\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (op.\non reh\u2019g).\n       Article 38.21 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides that statements made by\na person accused of a crime \u201cmay be used in evidence against him if it appears that the same w[ere]\nfreely and voluntarily made without compulsion or persuasion[.]\u201d TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN.\nart. 38.21 (West 2005). A person\u2019s mental deficiency alone is not determinative in ascertaining\nthe voluntariness of a confession and the waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. Penry v. State, 903 S.W.2d 715, 744 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); Smith v. State, 779\nS.W.2d 417, 429 n.8 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989); see Casias v. State, 452 S.W.2d 483, 488 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1970) (holding that confession was admissible even though defendant had an IQ of 68,\nwas illiterate, and had a mental age of eight to ten years); Grayson v. State, 438 S.W.2d 553, 555\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1969) (concluding that statements from a defendant who had an IQ of 51 and a\nmental age of six years were admissible). Rather, in determining whether a confession was\nvoluntarily made, courts must examine the totality of the circumstances. Delao v. State, 235\nS.W.3d 235, 239 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citing Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 285-86,\n111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991)). Accordingly, \u201can accused\u2019s mentality is but one factor\namong many to consider when evaluating the voluntariness of a confession.\u201d Id. at 240 (citing\nBizzarri v. State, 492 S.W.2d 944, 946 (Tex. Crim. App. 1973)). The totality-of-the-circumstances\nstandard is sufficiently all-encompassing to protect a defendant\u2019s rights, taking into account such\nfactors as intelligence, age, experience, and maturity. Id. at 241. Because mental capabilities are\nmerely one factor to be evaluated among many, \u201cthis measure of voluntariness may be applicable\nto confessions made by anyone, no matter what [his] IQ happens to be.\u201d Id.\nAnalysis\n       At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the trial judge heard Special Agent Hughes testify\nthat Appellant responded appropriately to questions and was able to follow a timeline. The trial\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fjudge also viewed the video recording of Hughes\u2019s questioning of Appellant. In addition, the trial\njudge heard Dr. Plasay testify that Appellant\u2019s mild IDD placed him in a category of individuals\nwho have an elevated risk of internalizing the suggestions of the person interrogating them and\ngiving false confessions. The trial judge also heard Plasay testify that she did not evaluate whether\nAppellant understood the Miranda warning, and that a diagnosis of IDD does not preclude\nsomeone from understanding the Miranda warning. Moreover, the trial judge heard evidence that\ntwo prior evaluations of Appellant did not result in a diagnosis of IDD.\n        Based upon our review of the record and considering the totality of the circumstances\nrelated to Appellant\u2019s confession, we conclude that the trial court did not err by concluding that\nAppellant was capable of voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights and did so. See Kerwick, 393\nS.W.3d at 273; Meekins, 340 S.W.3d at 460; Armendariz, 123 S.W.3d at 404; Ross, 32 S.W.3d at\n855; see also TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.21. We also conclude that the trial court\ncorrectly determined that Appellant\u2019s confession was made voluntarily despite any intellectual\ndeficiencies. See Delao, 235 S.W.3d at 239-41; Penry, 903 S.W.3d at 744; Smith, 779 S.W.2d at\n429 n.8; see also Casias, 452 S.W.2d at 488; Grayson, 438 S.W.3d at 555. Furthermore, we\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the video recording of\nAppellant\u2019s confession into evidence and allowing testimony regarding Appellant\u2019s confession.\nSee Johnson, 490 S.W.3d at 908; Gonzalez, 544 S.W.3d at 370; Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 391.\nFor all these reasons, we overrule issues one and two.\n\n\n                                      SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n        In issue three, Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction\non count one, and in issue four, Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his\nconviction on count two. 4 Specifically, Appellant asserts that when his confession is removed\nfrom consideration, the evidence is insufficient. We address issues three and four together.\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n        In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we review all the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found the\nessential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893,\n\n\n        4\n          Appellant discusses both legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence in his brief. However, we only apply\nthe Jackson v. Virginia standard. See Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 912 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n\n                                                         8\n\f902 n.19 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781,\n61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)); Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). \u201cThe trial\njudge, when sitting as the sole trier of facts, is the exclusive judge of the credibility of the witnesses\nand the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d Joseph v. State, 897 S.W.2d 374, 376 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1995). The factfinder is the ultimate authority on the credibility of witnesses and the weight\nto be given their testimony. Penagraph v. State, 623 S.W.2d 341, 343 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel\nOp.] 1981). We defer to the trial court\u2019s responsibility to resolve any conflicts in the evidence, to\nweigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Isassi v.\nState, 330 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Clayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2007).\n        To meet its burden of proof, the State was required to prove that Appellant intentionally or\nknowingly caused serious bodily injury to A.F., as charged in the indictment. See TEX. PENAL\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 22.04(a) (West 2019). The Texas Penal Code defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as a\n\u201cbodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent\ndisfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 1.07(a)(46) (West 2021). Because injury to a child is a \u201cresult-oriented\u201d or \u201cresult of\nconduct\u201d offense, the culpable mental state relates to the result of the charged conduct rather than\nthe nature or circumstances surrounding the charged conduct, and the defendant must have\nengaged in the conduct with the required culpability to cause the result. Haggins v. State, 785\nS.W.2d 827, 828 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); Patterson v. State, 46 S.W.3d 294, 301 (Tex. App.\u2014\nFort Worth 2001, pet. ref\u2019d). A person acts intentionally \u201cwhen it is his conscious objective or\ndesire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 6.03(a) (West\n2021). A person acts knowingly \u201cwhen he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause\nthe result.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6.03(b). Proof of a culpable mental state generally relies upon circumstantial\nevidence, and it ordinarily must be inferred from the accused\u2019s acts, words, conduct, and the\nsurrounding circumstances. Moore v. State, 154 S.W.3d 703, 712 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2004,\npet. ref\u2019d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fAnalysis\n         The trial court heard evidence that Appellant confessed to throwing A.F. onto the bed,\nshaking her, and spinning her bassinette because she would not be quiet and he lost his temper. 5\nIn addition, the trial court heard evidence that A.F. suffered from abusive head trauma on two\noccasions, as well as a rib fracture that occurred at least seven days before she was admitted to the\nhospital. The trial court further heard evidence that A.F. required two neurosurgical procedures,\nboth of her head injuries created a substantial risk of death, and A.F. needed occupational therapy,\nspeech therapy, and physical therapy. The trial court also heard evidence that A.F. required\nmedication to control her seizures, and A.F. would face challenges for the rest of her life.\nFurthermore, the trial court heard Fails testify that he saw Appellant shake A.F. Viewing all the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s finding and deferring to the trial court\u2019s\nexclusive role in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony,\nwe conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Appellant\nintentionally or knowingly caused serious bodily injury to A.F., as charged in counts one and two\nof the indictment.

We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.\n\n\n                                                  BACKGROUND\n       Appellant was indicted for two counts of injury to a child. As to both counts, the indictment\nalleged that Appellant intentionally or knowingly seriously injured A.F. by shaking her, throwing\nher, or causing her bassinette to fall over. Count one alleged that Appellant committed an offense\non or about June 26, 2018, through August 14, 2018, and count two alleged that Appellant\ncommitted an offense on or about August 15, 2018, through August 16, 2018.\n       In a pretrial motion to suppress his confession, Appellant asserted that he was unable to\nwaive his Miranda 2 rights intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily because he suffers from an\nintellectual developmental disability (\u201cIDD\u201d). Appellant included as an exhibit to his motion a\n\n       1\n           Appellant waived his right to a jury trial as to both guilt-innocence and punishment.\n       2\n           See Miranda v.

Ed. 2d 694</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\freport from Dr. Patricia Plasay, a licensed forensic psychologist with Forensic and Clinical\nPsychology Center in Tyler. In her report, Plasay concluded that Appellant meets the criteria for\na diagnosis of IDD, and she determined that Appellant \u201cevidence[s] significant deficits in both\nintellectual and adaptive functioning\u201d and has \u201ca difficult time understanding complex, multi-step\ninstructions.\u201d\n       At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Special Agent Rusty Hughes with the Texas\nDepartment of Safety Criminal Investigation Division testified that on June 24, 2019, he conducted\na custodial interview of Appellant after the Rusk Police Department asked him to assist with the\ninvestigation. Before interviewing Appellant, Hughes read Appellant his Miranda rights. Hughes\ntestified that he never coerced or threatened Appellant and did not deny Appellant any necessities.\nHughes explained that he conducted a polygraph examination of Appellant, which consisted of\nfour parts: the pre-test interview, data collection, data analysis, and post-test interview. According\nto Hughes, Appellant responded appropriately to questions and was able to follow a timeline.\nHughes testified that Appellant initially acted as though he did not know how A.F. was injured,\nand he blamed others.\n       After administering the polygraph examination to Appellant and scoring it, Hughes\nbelieved Appellant was being deceptive regarding the questions about A.F., and he informed\nAppellant of the results of the examination. Hughes explained that during the interview he\nconducted after the polygraph examination, Appellant \u201coriginally started right back where he was,\ndenying it, and it took a little while for him to finally decide to talk about what had happened\nbetween him and [A.F.].\u201d Appellant eventually told Hughes that he had thrown A.F. onto the bed\nand apologized to her afterward. As the interview progressed, Appellant admitted that he shook\nA.F. and spun A.F.\u2019s bassinette because he lost his temper. According to Hughes, Appellant did\nnot show any signs of an intellectual disability during the interview. Hughes testified that\nAppellant comprehended what Hughes was saying, and \u201chis responses were quick.\u201d\n       Dr. Plasay testified that defense counsel asked her to evaluate whether Appellant has an\nintellectual disability. In performing her evaluation, Plasay reviewed Appellant\u2019s court records,\nmedical and psychiatric records, lease, school records, three interrogations of Appellant, and\ncollateral information provided by defense counsel, and her report was admitted into evidence.\nPlasay also interviewed Appellant\u2019s parents, and she interviewed Appellant for three hours. Plasay\nconcluded that Appellant has IDD, which she explained is \u201cdefined as significant deficits in\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fintellectual and adaptive functioning that are present during the formative years of development,\nmeaning prior to age 18.\u201d Plasay stated that individuals who suffer from IDD have a lower IQ\nthan 98% of the population. Plasay testified that Appellant \u201chas a well-established, extensive\npsychiatric history dating back to his early childhood[,]\u201d and Appellant \u201chad marked behavioral\nand academic problems\u201d in school and at home. According to Plasay, Access MHMR diagnosed\nAppellant with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder, generalized anxiety\ndisorder, major depressive disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning.\n       Dr. Plasay explained that Appellant\u2019s IDD is mild, which means that Appellant has\nsufficient speech, can hold a reciprocal conversation, and can learn, but he needs modifications.\nAccording to Plasay, Appellant\u2019s estimated mental age is twelve years old, and his IQ is 70. Plasay\ntestified that individuals who suffer from IDD are highly suggestible, and \u201c[t]hey can be unduly\ninfluenced and defer to authority in some situations.\u201d Plasay explained that individuals with IDD\n\u201chave an elevated risk of internalizing the suggestions of the interrogator.\u201d Plasay stated that she\ndid not evaluate Appellant\u2019s comprehension of the Miranda warnings. When asked whether\nAppellant\u2019s level of verbal impairment would significantly impact his ability to understand a\nMiranda warning, Plasay stated that it is the trial judge\u2019s role to make that determination, and she\nexplained, \u201cAll I can say is that based on the findings, he would struggle more than the average\nperson.\u201d Plasay described Appellant\u2019s ability to understand and comprehend verbal information\nas \u201csignificantly impaired[,]\u201d and she characterized his understanding during the interview by\nSpecial Agent Hughes as \u201c[l]imited.\u201d         Plasay opined that Appellant was confused and\noverwhelmed during the interview, and she testified that Appellant appeared to struggle with\ndirections and did not fully understand everything that was asked of him. According to Plasay,\npeople with IDD are more prone to giving false confessions, and she opined that Appellant falls\ninto that category.\n       During cross-examination, Plasay testified that she did not ask Appellant whether he\nunderstood the Miranda warning, and she did not assess his ability to understand it. Plasay stated,\n\u201cI can\u2019t render an opinion on an evaluation I didn\u2019t conduct.\u201d Plasay explained that a diagnosis of\nIDD does not preclude someone from understanding a Miranda warning. Plasay agreed that the\nonly time Appellant appeared to be emotionally overwhelmed was when he was confessing to\nthrowing A.F. onto the bed and shaking her. In addition, Plasay testified that she obtained all the\ninformation for her evaluation from defense counsel, and she admitted that if more records exist,\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fher opinion might change. Plasay explained that two previous assessments conducted during\nAppellant\u2019s school years concluded that Appellant does not suffer from IDD, but when Appellant\nwas in school, he had \u201csignificant problems that required special education.\u201d Plasay explained that\nshe was not testifying that Appellant\u2019s confession was false or coerced, and when asked whether\nhis confession could have been voluntary and based upon a knowing and intelligent waiver of his\nrights, she stated that it \u201ccould have been.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to suppress.\n       At trial, Dr. Elizabeth Peeler testified that she is a physician in the REACH clinic of UT\nSouthwestern and Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas, where she evaluates patients in cases of\nsuspected child abuse or neglect. Peeler explained that A.F. suffered from abusive head trauma,\nformerly referred to as \u201cshaken baby syndrome,\u201d when she was seven weeks old. According to\nPeeler, A.F. was a normal, healthy baby until August 15, 2018, when she was found unresponsive\nand not breathing. Upon examining A.F., Peeler discovered that the fontanelle at the top of A.F.\u2019s\nhead was full and bulging, which Peeler explained is a sign of increased pressure in the brain. Dr.\nPeeler testified that a CT scan revealed that A.F. had bilateral subdural hematomas, which \u201chad a\ndifferent appearance [than] the blood that appeared newer on CT scan, which was located in both\nof the temples on the back of the brain.\u201d Peeler testified that because A.F. did not have a skull\nfracture, her \u201cacceleration-deceleration whiplash\u201d injuries must have resulted from \u201ca shaking-\ntype mechanism[,]\u201d such as shaking back and forth, shaking and slamming, or shaking and tossing.\n       According to Peeler, a chest X-ray revealed that A.F. also had a left first rib fracture, which\nwas already in the healing stages. Peeler explained that because it takes seven to ten days for bone\nhealing to be identifiable on x-rays, A.F.\u2019s rib fracture must have occurred at least seven days\nearlier. Peeler testified that A.F. also suffered from five retinal hemorrhages in her left eye, which\nwere caused by the same type of acceleration-deceleration whiplash mechanism. According to\nPeeler, none of A.F.\u2019s family members provided any history of dropping her, and a brain bleed\nfrom a fall \u201cwould not be diffuse and bilateral\u201d and would not cause such significant symptoms.\nPeeler explained that A.F. could have received her acceleration-deceleration injuries from being\nthrown onto the top of a bed because such an event \u201ccauses the brain to whiplash back and forth\non the inside.\u201d\n       Peeler testified that A.F. required two neurosurgical procedures: (1) inserting a needle into\nher fontanelle to relieve the pressure, and (2) drilling a burr hole into her skull after the needle\nprocedure did not fully relieve the pressure. A.F. also required a blood transfusion. According to\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fPeeler, an MRI scan indicated that the left frontal part of A.F.\u2019s brain had begun to atrophy due to\n\u201c[a] significant trauma\u201d that resulted in a lack of nutrients to the brain. Peeler explained that A.F.\u2019s\ninjuries created a substantial risk of death, and A.F. required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a\nblood transfusion and multiple procedures, and had to be transferred to two pediatric hospitals.\nAccording to Peeler, A.F. suffered two instances of abusive head trauma, and both the older brain\nbleed and the newer brain bleed were injuries that carry a substantial risk of death. Peeler estimated\nthat A.F.\u2019s newer brain bleed occurred forty-eight hours before she was seen at Trinity Frances\nHospital on August 16, 2018, and the older brain bleed occurred sometime after her birth but before\nthe newer brain bleed. A.F. had to be readmitted to the hospital two times due to complications\nfrom seizures, and A.F. has required occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy,\nand she requires medications to control her seizures. Peeler explained that A.F. suffered long-term\neffects from her injuries, and A.F. will \u201cremain challenged for the rest of her life.\u201d\n        Officer Michael Goff testified that on August 16, 2018, he responded to an apartment in\nRusk, where A.F. was lying on the floor and a man was performing CPR on her. According to\nGoff, Appellant stayed outside, and Appellant \u201cjust seemed angry more than anything.\u201d Nicholas\nCastle, a Texas Ranger with the Texas Department of Public Safety, testified that in August 2018,\nthe Rusk Police Department asked him to assist with the investigation regarding A.F.\u2019s injuries.\nRanger Castle explained that he assisted the police with interviewing witnesses, and he eventually\nconducted a non-custodial interview of Appellant. Castle testified that Appellant responded\npromptly and appropriately during the interview, and a video recording of the interview was\nadmitted into evidence. Castle opined that Appellant was being untruthful regarding A.F.\u2019s\ninjuries. Appellant ended the interview after informing Castle that he wanted an attorney.\n        Special Agent Hughes testified that he conducted a video-recorded custodial interview of\nAppellant in June 2019. Special Agent Hughes explained that he advised Appellant of his Miranda\nrights before the interview began, and Appellant agreed to speak with him. The video recording\nwas admitted into evidence over defense counsel\u2019s objection that Appellant did not intelligently,\nvoluntarily, or knowingly waive his Miranda rights. Hughes testified that he would have used\ndeception to facilitate obtaining a confession from Appellant even if he had known that Appellant\nmight suffer from IDD. Jonathan Fails, who lived in the same apartment complex as Appellant,\ntestified that on one occasion, he saw Appellant shake A.F. Chief Stephen Hughes of the Rusk\nPolice Department testified that he participated in Special Agent Hughes\u2019s interview of Appellant,\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fand he explained that during the interview, Appellant confessed to throwing A.F. onto the bed,\nhitting or kicking her bassinette, and shaking A.F. because she would not be quiet. Chief Hughes\ntestified that Appellant did not appear to be mentally deficient, and he stated that Appellant could\nunderstand and answer the questions he was asked.\n         As discussed above, the trial court found Appellant guilty as to both counts and sentenced\nAppellant to fifty years of confinement on each count. The trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s\nsentences would run concurrently. This appeal followed.\n\n\n       DENIAL OF MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND ADMISSION OF CONFESSION INTO EVIDENCE\n         In issue one, Appellant complains of the denial of his motion to suppress his confession,\nand in issue two, Appellant challenges the admission of his confession into evidence as to both\ncharged counts. Because issues one and two are related, we address them together. 3\nStandard of Review and Applicable Law\n         We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard. Hubert\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1464366\"><a href=\"/opinion/1464366/hubert-v-state/\">312 S.W.3d 554</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559 (Tex. Crim.

However, we review de novo\nquestions of law and mixed questions of law and fact that do not rely on credibility determinations.\nKerwick, 393 S.W.3d at 273. When, as here, a trial court does not make written findings explaining\nthe factual basis for its decision, we imply findings of fact that support the trial court\u2019s ruling if\nthe evidence supports those implied findings.

We must uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling\n\n\n\n         3\n          Ordinarily, we would address issues three and four first because, if sustained, they would result in rendition\nof a judgment of acquittal.

However, because Appellant argues in issues three and four that we must not consider\nevidence of his confession because such evidence was improperly admitted, we will address issues one and two first.\n\n\n                                                           6\n\fon a motion to suppress if the ruling is supported by the record and is correct under any theory of\nlaw applicable to the case.

In addition, the trial\njudge heard Dr. Plasay testify that Appellant\u2019s mild IDD placed him in a category of individuals\nwho have an elevated risk of internalizing the suggestions of the person interrogating them and\ngiving false confessions. The trial judge also heard Plasay testify that she did not evaluate whether\nAppellant understood the Miranda warning, and that a diagnosis of IDD does not preclude\nsomeone from understanding the Miranda warning. Moreover, the trial judge heard evidence that\ntwo prior evaluations of Appellant did not result in a diagnosis of IDD.\n        Based upon our review of the record and considering the totality of the circumstances\nrelated to Appellant\u2019s confession, we conclude that the trial court did not err by concluding that\nAppellant was capable of voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights and did so.

See TEX. PENAL\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 22.04(a) (West 2019). The Texas Penal Code defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as a\n\u201cbodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent\ndisfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 1.07(a)(46) (West 2021). Because injury to a child is a \u201cresult-oriented\u201d or \u201cresult of\nconduct\u201d offense, the culpable mental state relates to the result of the charged conduct rather than\nthe nature or circumstances surrounding the charged conduct, and the defendant must have\nengaged in the conduct with the required culpability to cause the result.

The trial court further heard evidence that A.F. required two neurosurgical procedures,\nboth of her head injuries created a substantial risk of death, and A.F. needed occupational therapy,\nspeech therapy, and physical therapy. The trial court also heard evidence that A.F. required\nmedication to control her seizures, and A.F. would face challenges for the rest of her life.\nFurthermore, the trial court heard Fails testify that he saw Appellant shake A.F. Viewing all the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s finding and deferring to the trial court\u2019s\nexclusive role in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony,\nwe conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Appellant\nintentionally or knowingly caused serious bodily injury to A.F., as charged in counts one and two\nof the indictment.

B-R. v. J. D.\u2014DISSENT\n\n   EVELEIGH, J., dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I\ndisagree with the conclusion of the majority that (1)\nthe trial court did not apply an objective standard to\nthe first element of stalking in its determination of \u2018\u2018rea-\nsonable fear\u2019\u2019 and (2) there is insufficient evidence to\nsupport a finding that it was reasonably likely that the\ndefendant, J. D., would continue to stalk or to commit\nacts designed to intimidate or retaliate against the plain-\ntiff, S. B-R., as required for an order of civil protection\npursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-16a. To the contrary,\nI would conclude that (1) the trial court correctly fol-\nlowed the statute, and (2) there is sufficient evidence\nin the record to support the trial court\u2019s decision grant-\ning the plaintiff\u2019s application for an order of civil protec-\ntion pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a. Accordingly, I would affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.1\n   I begin by setting forth the factual background of this\naction, as gleaned from the record. At all relevant times,\nthe plaintiff and the defendant were students at a com-\nmunity college, where they were both enrolled in the\ncollege\u2019s nursing program. On July 8, 2019, the plaintiff\nfiled an application for an order of civil protection. A\nhearing was held on the plaintiff\u2019s application on July\n22, 2019, at which both the plaintiff and the defendant\ntestified.\n   The plaintiff testified that she knew the defendant\nfrom school and that, on or about February 28, 2019,\nthe defendant had sent her an \u2018\u2018absurd amount of e-mails\nstating that, first, my marriage would have intervene[d]\nwith things between us . . . .\u2019\u2019 When asked whether\nshe was married, the plaintiff explained that she was\nnot and that, in an effort to get the defendant to stop\ncommunicating with her, she had lied to the defendant\nand told him that she was getting married. When asked\nwhether the defendant had made any statements to her\nthat made her fear for her personal safety, the plaintiff\nresponded yes. Specifically, she testified about an\ne-mail that the defendant had sent her on or about\nMarch 1, 2019, which stated: \u2018\u2018Honestly, I want to jump\non your back a little a rage and that would be dumb.\u2019\u2019\nThe plaintiff further testified that, on March 3, 2019,\nthe defendant sent her text messages about being sui-\ncidal, and that, on February 28, 2019, while in the pres-\nence of another person, he had made comments about\nher breasts that made her fearful of his conduct. With\nrespect to the comments about her breasts, the plaintiff\nstated that the defendant \u2018\u2018was being cocky and . . .\nwas trying to intimidate [her].\u2019\u2019 Although the plaintiff\nacknowledged that the communications from the defen-\ndant ceased after March 3, 2019, she testified in July,\n2019, that his communications with her caused her to\nfear for her personal safety, that she still feared for her\n\fpersonal safety, that she planned to attend classes at\nthe community college in the fall, and that she feared\nthat her safety would be at risk if she had any contact\nwith the defendant.\n   The defendant testified that, in the upcoming fall\nsemester, he did have classes with the plaintiff at the\ncommunity college. He also acknowledged that he suf-\nfers from \u2018\u2018a major depressive disorder,\u2019\u2019 which includes\nsuicidal thoughts. Although he claimed that the symp-\ntoms underlying the disorder are \u2018\u2018all controlled,\u2019\u2019 he\nalso acknowledged that all of the symptoms have \u2018\u2018not\ngone yet.\u2019\u2019\n  The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for an\norder of civil protection in an oral decision, stating\nthat the \u2018\u2018[s]tatute is very clear that indicates that such\nperson causes reasonable fear\u2014the conduct of the\ndefendant causes reasonable fear for the physical\nsafety.2 So she\u2019s made it very clear [that] she\u2019s very\napprehensive, her conduct on the stand indicated she\u2019s\nreliving some of these things. Things which, depending\non your level of threshold and thickness of skin, become\nmore or less significant. But, it\u2019s very clear that this is\nvery upsetting to her, and it\u2019s affected her ability to\ncarry on life\u2019s activities.\u2019\u2019 (Footnote added.) The court\nordered the defendant not to have any contact with the\nplaintiff and to stay 100 yards away from the plaintiff,\nand its order was effective for one year, until July 22,\n2020.3\n  The decision of the majority to reverse the judgment\nof the trial court hinges on the majority\u2019s conclusion\nthat (1) the trial court did not apply an objective stan-\ndard to the first element of stalking in its determination\nof \u2018\u2018reasonable fear,\u2019\u2019 and (2) \u2018\u2018the plaintiff presented\nno evidence that the defendant would continue to stalk\nher.\u2019\u20194 I disagree and would conclude, after \u2018\u2018allow[ing]\nevery reasonable presumption in favor of the correct-\nness of [the trial court\u2019s] action\u2019\u2019; (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) Kayla M. v. Greene, 163 Conn. App.\n493, 504, 136 A.3d 1 (2016); that the trial court\u2019s decision\nwas reasonably supported by the evidence in the record\nor the inferences drawn therefrom.\n  I agree with the majority that a subjective-objective\ntest applies to the statute. I respectfully disagree, how-\never, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\ndid not consider the objective part of the test. The trial\ncourt was reading from the statute when it issued its\ndecision. Its emphasis on the subjective part of the test\ndoes not necessarily mean that the objective part was\nexcluded. In Connecticut, our appellate courts do not\npresume error on the part of the trial court. See Caroth-\ners v. Capozziello, 215 Conn. 82, 105, 574 A.2d 1268\n(1990). Rather, \u2018\u2018we presume that the trial court, in\nrendering its judgment . . . undertook the proper anal-\nysis of the law and the facts.\u2019\u2019 S & S Tobacco & Candy\nCo. v. Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., 224 Conn.\n\f313, 322, 617 A.2d 1388 (1992). In my view, the reference\nto Muhammed Ali and Whistler\u2019s Mother, and to a per-\nson with thin skin, may be interpreted as an example\nof the judge considering how much each case had to be\ndetermined on the basis of the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding it, and whether a reasonable person would\nbe fearful under the circumstances. Indeed, in cases in\nwhich there has been no finding by the trial court,\nappellate courts have searched the record to see if\nthe trial court\u2019s decision had an adequate basis in the\nrecord. Thus, in Brett Stone Painting & Maintenance,\nLLC v. New England Bank, 143 Conn. App. 671, 681,\n72 A.3d 1121 (2013), in which a finding of default was\na critical element in the case and the trial court had not\nmade that explicit finding, the Appellate Court reviewed\nthe record in its conclusion that an implicit finding of\ndefault was warranted. Likewise, in Young v. Commis-\nsioner of Correction, 104 Conn. App. 188, 190 n.1, 932\nA.2d 467 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 907, 942 A.2d\n416 (2008), in which the question of whether the habeas\npetitioner was in custody had not been decided in order\nfor the petitioner to maintain the habeas action, the\nAppellate Court was able to infer from the transcript\nthe facts on which the trial court\u2019s decision appeared\nto have been predicated. In the present case, the tran-\nscript is replete with the defendant\u2019s admissions to his\ndeplorable conduct. These admissions would certainly\njustify the inference that the objective standard had\nbeen met.\n   In Kayla M. v. Greene, supra, 163 Conn. App. 506, this\ncourt explained that \u2018\u2018an applicant for a civil protection\norder on the basis of stalking pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a\nmust prove only that there are \u2018reasonable grounds to\nbelieve\u2019 that every element is met and that such conduct\nwill continue.\u2019\u2019 In Kayla M., this court found that \u2018\u2018there\nwas sufficient evidence in the record from which the\ncourt reasonably could have concluded that there were\nreasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff subjec-\ntively feared for her physical safety.\u2019\u2019 Id., 511. Specifi-\ncally, this court found that the trial court had credited\nthe plaintiff\u2019s statements in her affidavit that she felt\nthreatened by the defendant Edward Greene after he\nhad grabbed her arm at her workplace and sent her a\nthreatening e-mail, and that the trial court reasonably\ncould have inferred, on the basis of those facts, that\nthe plaintiff feared for her physical safety. Id. Moreover,\nalthough Greene testified at the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s\napplication for a civil protection order that \u2018\u2018he had\nno intention of ever communicating with the plaintiff\nagain\u2019\u2019; id.; the trial court nevertheless found that he\nwas \u2018\u2018 \u2018unnaturally obsessed\u2019 \u2019\u2019 with the plaintiff, and it\nreasonably inferred, on the basis of that obsession, that\nhe \u2018\u2018would continue his previous course of conduct.\u2019\u2019\nId., 511, 512.\n  In the present case, the court reasonably could have\nfound, on the basis of the testimony presented, that\n\fthere were reasonable grounds to believe that the plain-\ntiff feared for her physical safety and that the defendant\nwould continue in his course of conduct. We do not\nexpect our trial judges to be soothsayers. All that is\nrequired is that there is a reasonable probability that\nthe defendant will repeat the reported conduct such\nthat there is a risk of imminent harm to the plaintiff.\nIn this case, I cannot say that the decision of the trial\ncourt was an abuse of discretion or that its finding\nregarding the plaintiff\u2019s clear apprehension of the defen-\ndant was clearly erroneous.\n  The record here clearly shows that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct toward the plaintiff was truly bizarre and fright-\nening. Clearly, the conduct was aberrant, obsessive,\nand delusional. He also threatened future assaultive\nconduct against the plaintiff when he said that he\nwanted to \u2018\u2018jump on [her] back,\u2019\u2019 in rage, even though\nhe acknowledged that \u2018\u2018that would be dumb.\u2019\u2019 He further\nindicated delusional behavior when, in response to the\nplaintiff\u2019s statement to him that she was getting married,\nhe stated that her marriage would interfere with their\nrelationship. There was no relationship between the\nplaintiff and the defendant. On the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s\ntestimony, however, the trial court reasonably could\nhave inferred that the defendant wanted more than a\nmere friendship and that the plaintiff must have realized\nthat, as she otherwise would not have invented the\nstory about being married. See In re Adalberto S., 27\nConn. App. 49, 54, 604 A.2d 822 (\u2018\u2018court may draw rea-\nsonable, logical inferences from the facts proven\u2019\u2019), cert.\ndenied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1328 (1992).\n   The defendant also testified that he has a major\ndepressive disorder that causes him to have suicidal\nthoughts and that the disorder, which caused his\nactions, has not fully gone away. Much like in Kayla\nM. v. Greene, supra, 163 Conn. App. 512, in which this\ncourt upheld the issuance of a civil protection order\nbased, in part, on the defendant\u2019s obsession with the\nplaintiff, the defendant in the present case was fixated\non the plaintiff, as evidenced by the numerous\nunwanted e-mail and text messages that he sent to her.\nIn testifying about his major depressive disorder,5 the\ndefendant stated that he thinks about things over and\nover, and he also acknowledged that the symptoms and\ndepression associated with his disorder have not gone\naway yet. The trial court reasonably could have inferred\nfrom that testimony that it was reasonably probable\nthat he would continue his conduct toward the plaintiff\nwhen school resumed. See State v. Richards, 196 Conn.\nApp. 387, 397, 229 A.3d 1157 (\u2018\u2018in determining whether\nthe evidence supports a particular inference . . . an\ninference need not be compelled by the evidence;\nrather, the evidence need only be reasonably suscepti-\nble of such an inference\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)), cert. granted, 335 Conn. 931, 236 A.3d 218\n(2020); Hannon v. Redler, 117 Conn. App. 403, 406, 979\n\fA.2d 558 (2009) (\u2018\u2018[i]t is within the province of the trial\ncourt to find facts and draw proper inferences from the\nevidence presented\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)); Lupoli v. Lupoli, 38 Conn. App. 639, 643, 662\nA.2d 809 (\u2018\u2018the role of the trial court as fact finder [is]\nto judge the credibility of the witnesses, to weigh the\nevidence and to draw logical inferences and conclu-\nsions from the facts proven\u2019\u2019), cert. denied, 235 Conn.\n907, 665 A.2d 902 (1995).\n   I also think it is important to note that the trial court\nin the present case had the benefit of hearing from both\nparties during the hearing and judging their credibility.\nThe court could have accepted or rejected all or a part\nof the defendant\u2019s testimony. \u2018\u2018Credibility must be\nassessed . . . not by reading the cold printed record,\nbut by observing firsthand the witness\u2019 conduct,\ndemeanor and attitude. . . . An appellate court must\ndefer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of credibility\nbecause [i]t is the [fact finder] . . . [who has] an oppor-\ntunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and\nthe parties; thus [the fact finder] is best able to judge\nthe credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary\ninferences therefrom.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks omit-\nted.) R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v. Hartford Accident & Indem-\nnity Co., 171 Conn. App. 61, 93\u201394, 156 A.3d 539 (2017),\naff\u2019d, 333 Conn. 343, 216 A.3d 629 (2019). It would strain\ncredulity for the court to have accepted the defendant\u2019s\ntestimony that he had ideas of hurting himself only and\nnever anyone else, when he clearly had issued a threat\nto jump on the plaintiff\u2019s back in rage. Further, the\ncourt obviously did not choose to accept the defen-\ndant\u2019s testimony that his condition was under control\nwhen the hearing occurred only a few months after his\nbizarre acts and he was going to attend the same school\nwith the plaintiff in September. Moreover, the defendant\nfreely admitted that he had considered suicide. Such\nan act of violence would certainly justify a trial judge\nto find that a protective order should issue to protect\nsomeone who had spurned him and against whom he\nhad made a threat to jump on her back in rage.\n   The threat of future conduct has to be a significant\nelement in any trial court\u2019s decision to issue a protective\norder, and there certainly was sufficient evidence of a\nprobability of future assaultive conduct here to cause\nreasonable fear in the plaintiff and to satisfy the objec-\ntive standard requirement. \u2018\u2018[A]n applicant for a civil\nprotection order on the basis of stalking pursuant to\n\u00a7 46b-16a must prove only that there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe that every element is met and that\nsuch conduct will continue. . . . In determining\nwhether there are reasonable grounds to believe that\nstalking occurred, it is instructive that, in the criminal\ncontext, [t]he phrase reasonable grounds to believe is\nsynonymous with probable cause. . . . While probable\ncause requires more than mere suspicion . . . the line\nbetween mere suspicion and probable cause necessarily\n\fmust be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light\nof the particular situation and with account taken of\nall the circumstances.\u2019\u2019 (Citations omitted; internal quo-\ntation marks omitted.) Kayla M. v. Greene, supra, 163\nConn. App. 506. The defendant\u2019s credibility, or lack\nthereof, is a key element in this determination.\n   The majority concludes that it must reverse because\nthe court did not consider the objective standard and\nthere is no evidence of future conduct. I respectfully\ndisagree because of the defendant\u2019s threat of jumping\non the plaintiff\u2019s back in rage, his unwanted e-mails,\nthe comment about the plaintiff\u2019s breasts, and his over-\nall lack of credibility. I further disagree because it would\nbe the rare case in which a defendant testified that he\nwould keep doing the acts which brought him before\nthe court or told someone else to that effect. The defen-\ndant in this case engaged in obsessive behavior. At the\nhearing, he admitted that part of his major depressive\ndisorder has an obsessive component, namely, that he\nwould keep thinking about the same thing over and\nover. He further testified that his condition was not\nfully resolved, as he must take medication every night\nand get treatment from counselors and therapists.\nBecause he had threatened the plaintiff, his testimony\nthat he never thought about hurting anyone else is not\ncredible. In my view, reviewing both the evidence and\nthe reasonable inferences derived therefrom, there\nclearly was no abuse of discretion in this matter.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  1\n     Our Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue of whether a \u00a7 46b-\n16a protective order may be granted when (1) there is prior evidence of\ncriminal stalking, (2) there is a threat of a future criminal act, and (3) the\ndefendant\u2019s testimony is not credible.\n   2\n     The court clearly relied on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181e (a), which pro-\nvides that a person is guilty of stalking in the third degree when such person\n\u2018\u2018recklessly causes another person to reasonably . . . fear for his or her\nphysical safety . . . .\u2019\u2019\n   3\n     Although the order of civil protection has expired, the present appeal\nis not moot. See C. A. v. G. L., 201 Conn. App. 734, 736 n.4, 243 A.3d 807\n(2020) (applying to order of civil protection under \u00a7 46b-16a principle that\n\u2018\u2018expiration of a six month domestic violence restraining order issued pursu-\nant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15 does not render an appeal from that order\nmoot due to adverse collateral consequences\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   4\n     The majority mentions in its decision the fact that the trial court made\nno explicit finding on the record that \u2018\u2018the defendant would continue to\ncommit acts of stalking against the plaintiff\u2019\u2019 but never states that such an\nexpress finding is required. Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a (b), a trial court may issue\nan order of civil protection if it finds \u2018\u2018that there are reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that the respondent has committed acts constituting grounds for\nissuance of an order . . . and will continue to commit such acts or acts\ndesigned to intimidate or retaliate against the applicant . . . .\u2019\u2019 This court\nhas explained previously that \u2018\u2018an applicant for a civil protection order on\nthe basis of stalking pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a must prove only that there are\n\u2018reasonable grounds to believe\u2019 that every element is met and that such\nconduct will continue.\u2019\u2019 Kayla M. v. Greene, 163 Conn. App. 493, 506, 136\nA.3d 1 (2016). Neither the statute nor case law directs that the court\u2019s\nfindings must be written or express. Moreover, appellate courts \u2018\u2018presume\nthat the trial court, in rendering its judgment . . . undertook the proper\nanalysis of the law and the facts.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Brett\nStone Painting & Maintenance, LLC v. New England Bank, 143 Conn. App.\n671, 681, 72 A.3d 1121 (2013). In the present case, given the trial court\u2019s\n\freference, in its oral decision, to the \u2018\u2018very clear\u2019\u2019 requirements of the \u2018\u2018stat-\nute,\u2019\u2019 it reasonably can be inferred that the court relied on the language in\nthe statute in rendering its decision.\n   5\n     A significant portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination\nconcerned his major depressive disorder, from which the defendant readily\nacknowledged that he suffers. He also testified and acknowledged that one\nof the behaviors of his disorder is obsessive type behavior. Under these\ncircumstances, the court was free to accept or reject all or part of the\ndefendant\u2019s testimony about his obsessive type behavior. See Kayla M. v.\nGreene, supra, 163 Conn. App. 511\u201312 (court reasonably could have inferred\nfrom evidence produced at hearing that defendant was \u2018\u2018 \u2018unnaturally\nobsessed\u2019 \u2019\u2019 with plaintiff, and, on basis of that obsession, court could have\ninferred that defendant would continue his previous course of conduct).\n\f",

B-R. v. J. D.\u2014DISSENT\n\n   EVELEIGH, J., dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I\ndisagree with the conclusion of the majority that (1)\nthe trial court did not apply an objective standard to\nthe first element of stalking in its determination of \u2018\u2018rea-\nsonable fear\u2019\u2019 and (2) there is insufficient evidence to\nsupport a finding that it was reasonably likely that the\ndefendant, J. D., would continue to stalk or to commit\nacts designed to intimidate or retaliate against the plain-\ntiff, S. B-R., as required for an order of civil protection\npursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-16a. To the contrary,\nI would conclude that (1) the trial court correctly fol-\nlowed the statute, and (2) there is sufficient evidence\nin the record to support the trial court\u2019s decision grant-\ning the plaintiff\u2019s application for an order of civil protec-\ntion pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a. Accordingly, I would affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.1\n   I begin by setting forth the factual background of this\naction, as gleaned from the record. At all relevant times,\nthe plaintiff and the defendant were students at a com-\nmunity college, where they were both enrolled in the\ncollege\u2019s nursing program. On July 8, 2019, the plaintiff\nfiled an application for an order of civil protection. A\nhearing was held on the plaintiff\u2019s application on July\n22, 2019, at which both the plaintiff and the defendant\ntestified.\n   The plaintiff testified that she knew the defendant\nfrom school and that, on or about February 28, 2019,\nthe defendant had sent her an \u2018\u2018absurd amount of e-mails\nstating that, first, my marriage would have intervene[d]\nwith things between us . . . .\u2019\u2019 When asked whether\nshe was married, the plaintiff explained that she was\nnot and that, in an effort to get the defendant to stop\ncommunicating with her, she had lied to the defendant\nand told him that she was getting married. When asked\nwhether the defendant had made any statements to her\nthat made her fear for her personal safety, the plaintiff\nresponded yes. Specifically, she testified about an\ne-mail that the defendant had sent her on or about\nMarch 1, 2019, which stated: \u2018\u2018Honestly, I want to jump\non your back a little a rage and that would be dumb.\u2019\u2019\nThe plaintiff further testified that, on March 3, 2019,\nthe defendant sent her text messages about being sui-\ncidal, and that, on February 28, 2019, while in the pres-\nence of another person, he had made comments about\nher breasts that made her fearful of his conduct. With\nrespect to the comments about her breasts, the plaintiff\nstated that the defendant \u2018\u2018was being cocky and . . .\nwas trying to intimidate [her].\u2019\u2019 Although the plaintiff\nacknowledged that the communications from the defen-\ndant ceased after March 3, 2019, she testified in July,\n2019, that his communications with her caused her to\nfear for her personal safety, that she still feared for her\n\fpersonal safety, that she planned to attend classes at\nthe community college in the fall, and that she feared\nthat her safety would be at risk if she had any contact\nwith the defendant.\n   The defendant testified that, in the upcoming fall\nsemester, he did have classes with the plaintiff at the\ncommunity college. He also acknowledged that he suf-\nfers from \u2018\u2018a major depressive disorder,\u2019\u2019 which includes\nsuicidal thoughts. Although he claimed that the symp-\ntoms underlying the disorder are \u2018\u2018all controlled,\u2019\u2019 he\nalso acknowledged that all of the symptoms have \u2018\u2018not\ngone yet.\u2019\u2019\n  The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for an\norder of civil protection in an oral decision, stating\nthat the \u2018\u2018[s]tatute is very clear that indicates that such\nperson causes reasonable fear\u2014the conduct of the\ndefendant causes reasonable fear for the physical\nsafety.2 So she\u2019s made it very clear [that] she\u2019s very\napprehensive, her conduct on the stand indicated she\u2019s\nreliving some of these things. Things which, depending\non your level of threshold and thickness of skin, become\nmore or less significant. But, it\u2019s very clear that this is\nvery upsetting to her, and it\u2019s affected her ability to\ncarry on life\u2019s activities.\u2019\u2019 (Footnote added.) The court\nordered the defendant not to have any contact with the\nplaintiff and to stay 100 yards away from the plaintiff,\nand its order was effective for one year, until July 22,\n2020.3\n  The decision of the majority to reverse the judgment\nof the trial court hinges on the majority\u2019s conclusion\nthat (1) the trial court did not apply an objective stan-\ndard to the first element of stalking in its determination\nof \u2018\u2018reasonable fear,\u2019\u2019 and (2) \u2018\u2018the plaintiff presented\nno evidence that the defendant would continue to stalk\nher.\u2019\u20194 I disagree and would conclude, after \u2018\u2018allow[ing]\nevery reasonable presumption in favor of the correct-\nness of [the trial court\u2019s] action\u2019\u2019; (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) Kayla M. v. Greene, 163 Conn. App.\n493, 504, 136 A.3d 1 (2016); that the trial court\u2019s decision\nwas reasonably supported by the evidence in the record\nor the inferences drawn therefrom.\n  I agree with the majority that a subjective-objective\ntest applies to the statute. I respectfully disagree, how-\never, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\ndid not consider the objective part of the test. The trial\ncourt was reading from the statute when it issued its\ndecision. Its emphasis on the subjective part of the test\ndoes not necessarily mean that the objective part was\nexcluded. In Connecticut, our appellate courts do not\npresume error on the part of the trial court. See Caroth-\ners v. Capozziello, 215 Conn. 82, 105, 574 A.2d 1268\n(1990). Rather, \u2018\u2018we presume that the trial court, in\nrendering its judgment . . . undertook the proper anal-\nysis of the law and the facts.\u2019\u2019 S & S Tobacco & Candy\nCo. v. Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., 224 Conn.\n\f313, 322, 617 A.2d 1388 (1992). In my view, the reference\nto Muhammed Ali and Whistler\u2019s Mother, and to a per-\nson with thin skin, may be interpreted as an example\nof the judge considering how much each case had to be\ndetermined on the basis of the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding it, and whether a reasonable person would\nbe fearful under the circumstances. Indeed, in cases in\nwhich there has been no finding by the trial court,\nappellate courts have searched the record to see if\nthe trial court\u2019s decision had an adequate basis in the\nrecord. Thus, in Brett Stone Painting & Maintenance,\nLLC v. New England Bank, 143 Conn. App. 671, 681,\n72 A.3d 1121 (2013), in which a finding of default was\na critical element in the case and the trial court had not\nmade that explicit finding, the Appellate Court reviewed\nthe record in its conclusion that an implicit finding of\ndefault was warranted. Likewise, in Young v. Commis-\nsioner of Correction, 104 Conn. App. 188, 190 n.1, 932\nA.2d 467 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 907, 942 A.2d\n416 (2008), in which the question of whether the habeas\npetitioner was in custody had not been decided in order\nfor the petitioner to maintain the habeas action, the\nAppellate Court was able to infer from the transcript\nthe facts on which the trial court\u2019s decision appeared\nto have been predicated. In the present case, the tran-\nscript is replete with the defendant\u2019s admissions to his\ndeplorable conduct. These admissions would certainly\njustify the inference that the objective standard had\nbeen met.\n   In Kayla M. v. Greene, supra, 163 Conn. App. 506, this\ncourt explained that \u2018\u2018an applicant for a civil protection\norder on the basis of stalking pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a\nmust prove only that there are \u2018reasonable grounds to\nbelieve\u2019 that every element is met and that such conduct\nwill continue.\u2019\u2019 In Kayla M., this court found that \u2018\u2018there\nwas sufficient evidence in the record from which the\ncourt reasonably could have concluded that there were\nreasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff subjec-\ntively feared for her physical safety.\u2019\u2019 Id., 511. Specifi-\ncally, this court found that the trial court had credited\nthe plaintiff\u2019s statements in her affidavit that she felt\nthreatened by the defendant Edward Greene after he\nhad grabbed her arm at her workplace and sent her a\nthreatening e-mail, and that the trial court reasonably\ncould have inferred, on the basis of those facts, that\nthe plaintiff feared for her physical safety. Id. Moreover,\nalthough Greene testified at the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s\napplication for a civil protection order that \u2018\u2018he had\nno intention of ever communicating with the plaintiff\nagain\u2019\u2019; id.; the trial court nevertheless found that he\nwas \u2018\u2018 \u2018unnaturally obsessed\u2019 \u2019\u2019 with the plaintiff, and it\nreasonably inferred, on the basis of that obsession, that\nhe \u2018\u2018would continue his previous course of conduct.\u2019\u2019\nId., 511, 512.\n  In the present case, the court reasonably could have\nfound, on the basis of the testimony presented, that\n\fthere were reasonable grounds to believe that the plain-\ntiff feared for her physical safety and that the defendant\nwould continue in his course of conduct. We do not\nexpect our trial judges to be soothsayers. All that is\nrequired is that there is a reasonable probability that\nthe defendant will repeat the reported conduct such\nthat there is a risk of imminent harm to the plaintiff.\nIn this case, I cannot say that the decision of the trial\ncourt was an abuse of discretion or that its finding\nregarding the plaintiff\u2019s clear apprehension of the defen-\ndant was clearly erroneous.\n  The record here clearly shows that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct toward the plaintiff was truly bizarre and fright-\nening. Clearly, the conduct was aberrant, obsessive,\nand delusional. He also threatened future assaultive\nconduct against the plaintiff when he said that he\nwanted to \u2018\u2018jump on [her] back,\u2019\u2019 in rage, even though\nhe acknowledged that \u2018\u2018that would be dumb.\u2019\u2019 He further\nindicated delusional behavior when, in response to the\nplaintiff\u2019s statement to him that she was getting married,\nhe stated that her marriage would interfere with their\nrelationship. There was no relationship between the\nplaintiff and the defendant. On the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s\ntestimony, however, the trial court reasonably could\nhave inferred that the defendant wanted more than a\nmere friendship and that the plaintiff must have realized\nthat, as she otherwise would not have invented the\nstory about being married. See In re Adalberto S., 27\nConn. App. 49, 54, 604 A.2d 822 (\u2018\u2018court may draw rea-\nsonable, logical inferences from the facts proven\u2019\u2019), cert.\ndenied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1328 (1992).\n   The defendant also testified that he has a major\ndepressive disorder that causes him to have suicidal\nthoughts and that the disorder, which caused his\nactions, has not fully gone away. Much like in Kayla\nM. v. Greene, supra, 163 Conn. App. 512, in which this\ncourt upheld the issuance of a civil protection order\nbased, in part, on the defendant\u2019s obsession with the\nplaintiff, the defendant in the present case was fixated\non the plaintiff, as evidenced by the numerous\nunwanted e-mail and text messages that he sent to her.\nIn testifying about his major depressive disorder,5 the\ndefendant stated that he thinks about things over and\nover, and he also acknowledged that the symptoms and\ndepression associated with his disorder have not gone\naway yet. The trial court reasonably could have inferred\nfrom that testimony that it was reasonably probable\nthat he would continue his conduct toward the plaintiff\nwhen school resumed. See State v. Richards, 196 Conn.\nApp. 387, 397, 229 A.3d 1157 (\u2018\u2018in determining whether\nthe evidence supports a particular inference . . . an\ninference need not be compelled by the evidence;\nrather, the evidence need only be reasonably suscepti-\nble of such an inference\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)), cert. granted, 335 Conn. 931, 236 A.3d 218\n(2020); Hannon v. Redler, 117 Conn. App. 403, 406, 979\n\fA.2d 558 (2009) (\u2018\u2018[i]t is within the province of the trial\ncourt to find facts and draw proper inferences from the\nevidence presented\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)); Lupoli v. Lupoli, 38 Conn. App. 639, 643, 662\nA.2d 809 (\u2018\u2018the role of the trial court as fact finder [is]\nto judge the credibility of the witnesses, to weigh the\nevidence and to draw logical inferences and conclu-\nsions from the facts proven\u2019\u2019), cert. denied, 235 Conn.\n907, 665 A.2d 902 (1995).\n   I also think it is important to note that the trial court\nin the present case had the benefit of hearing from both\nparties during the hearing and judging their credibility.\nThe court could have accepted or rejected all or a part\nof the defendant\u2019s testimony. \u2018\u2018Credibility must be\nassessed . . . not by reading the cold printed record,\nbut by observing firsthand the witness\u2019 conduct,\ndemeanor and attitude. . . . An appellate court must\ndefer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of credibility\nbecause [i]t is the [fact finder] . . . [who has] an oppor-\ntunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and\nthe parties; thus [the fact finder] is best able to judge\nthe credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary\ninferences therefrom.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks omit-\nted.) R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v. Hartford Accident & Indem-\nnity Co., 171 Conn. App. 61, 93\u201394, 156 A.3d 539 (2017),\naff\u2019d, 333 Conn. 343, 216 A.3d 629 (2019). It would strain\ncredulity for the court to have accepted the defendant\u2019s\ntestimony that he had ideas of hurting himself only and\nnever anyone else, when he clearly had issued a threat\nto jump on the plaintiff\u2019s back in rage. Further, the\ncourt obviously did not choose to accept the defen-\ndant\u2019s testimony that his condition was under control\nwhen the hearing occurred only a few months after his\nbizarre acts and he was going to attend the same school\nwith the plaintiff in September. Moreover, the defendant\nfreely admitted that he had considered suicide. Such\nan act of violence would certainly justify a trial judge\nto find that a protective order should issue to protect\nsomeone who had spurned him and against whom he\nhad made a threat to jump on her back in rage.\n   The threat of future conduct has to be a significant\nelement in any trial court\u2019s decision to issue a protective\norder, and there certainly was sufficient evidence of a\nprobability of future assaultive conduct here to cause\nreasonable fear in the plaintiff and to satisfy the objec-\ntive standard requirement. \u2018\u2018[A]n applicant for a civil\nprotection order on the basis of stalking pursuant to\n\u00a7 46b-16a must prove only that there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe that every element is met and that\nsuch conduct will continue. . . . In determining\nwhether there are reasonable grounds to believe that\nstalking occurred, it is instructive that, in the criminal\ncontext, [t]he phrase reasonable grounds to believe is\nsynonymous with probable cause. . . . While probable\ncause requires more than mere suspicion . . . the line\nbetween mere suspicion and probable cause necessarily\n\fmust be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light\nof the particular situation and with account taken of\nall the circumstances.\u2019\u2019 (Citations omitted; internal quo-\ntation marks omitted.) Kayla M. v. Greene, supra, 163\nConn. App. 506. The defendant\u2019s credibility, or lack\nthereof, is a key element in this determination.\n   The majority concludes that it must reverse because\nthe court did not consider the objective standard and\nthere is no evidence of future conduct. I respectfully\ndisagree because of the defendant\u2019s threat of jumping\non the plaintiff\u2019s back in rage, his unwanted e-mails,\nthe comment about the plaintiff\u2019s breasts, and his over-\nall lack of credibility. I further disagree because it would\nbe the rare case in which a defendant testified that he\nwould keep doing the acts which brought him before\nthe court or told someone else to that effect. The defen-\ndant in this case engaged in obsessive behavior. At the\nhearing, he admitted that part of his major depressive\ndisorder has an obsessive component, namely, that he\nwould keep thinking about the same thing over and\nover. He further testified that his condition was not\nfully resolved, as he must take medication every night\nand get treatment from counselors and therapists.\nBecause he had threatened the plaintiff, his testimony\nthat he never thought about hurting anyone else is not\ncredible. In my view, reviewing both the evidence and\nthe reasonable inferences derived therefrom, there\nclearly was no abuse of discretion in this matter.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  1\n     Our Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue of whether a \u00a7 46b-\n16a protective order may be granted when (1) there is prior evidence of\ncriminal stalking, (2) there is a threat of a future criminal act, and (3) the\ndefendant\u2019s testimony is not credible.\n   2\n     The court clearly relied on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181e (a), which pro-\nvides that a person is guilty of stalking in the third degree when such person\n\u2018\u2018recklessly causes another person to reasonably . . . fear for his or her\nphysical safety . . . .\u2019\u2019\n   3\n     Although the order of civil protection has expired, the present appeal\nis not moot. See C. A. v. G. L., 201 Conn. App. 734, 736 n.4, 243 A.3d 807\n(2020) (applying to order of civil protection under \u00a7 46b-16a principle that\n\u2018\u2018expiration of a six month domestic violence restraining order issued pursu-\nant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15 does not render an appeal from that order\nmoot due to adverse collateral consequences\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   4\n     The majority mentions in its decision the fact that the trial court made\nno explicit finding on the record that \u2018\u2018the defendant would continue to\ncommit acts of stalking against the plaintiff\u2019\u2019 but never states that such an\nexpress finding is required. Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a (b), a trial court may issue\nan order of civil protection if it finds \u2018\u2018that there are reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that the respondent has committed acts constituting grounds for\nissuance of an order . . . and will continue to commit such acts or acts\ndesigned to intimidate or retaliate against the applicant . . . .\u2019\u2019 This court\nhas explained previously that \u2018\u2018an applicant for a civil protection order on\nthe basis of stalking pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a must prove only that there are\n\u2018reasonable grounds to believe\u2019 that every element is met and that such\nconduct will continue.\u2019\u2019 Kayla M. v. Greene, 163 Conn. App. 493, 506, 136\nA.3d 1 (2016). Neither the statute nor case law directs that the court\u2019s\nfindings must be written or express. Moreover, appellate courts \u2018\u2018presume\nthat the trial court, in rendering its judgment . . . undertook the proper\nanalysis of the law and the facts.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Brett\nStone Painting & Maintenance, LLC v. New England Bank, 143 Conn. App.\n671, 681, 72 A.3d 1121 (2013). In the present case, given the trial court\u2019s\n\freference, in its oral decision, to the \u2018\u2018very clear\u2019\u2019 requirements of the \u2018\u2018stat-\nute,\u2019\u2019 it reasonably can be inferred that the court relied on the language in\nthe statute in rendering its decision.\n   5\n     A significant portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination\nconcerned his major depressive disorder, from which the defendant readily\nacknowledged that he suffers.

Under these\ncircumstances, the court was free to accept or reject all or part of the\ndefendant\u2019s testimony about his obsessive type behavior. See Kayla M. v.\nGreene, supra, 163 Conn.

B-R. v. J. D.\u2014DISSENT\n\n   EVELEIGH, J., dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I\ndisagree with the conclusion of the majority that (1)\nthe trial court did not apply an objective standard to\nthe first element of stalking in its determination of \u2018\u2018rea-\nsonable fear\u2019\u2019 and (2) there is insufficient evidence to\nsupport a finding that it was reasonably likely that the\ndefendant, J. D., would continue to stalk or to commit\nacts designed to intimidate or retaliate against the plain-\ntiff, S. B-R., as required for an order of civil protection\npursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-16a. To the contrary,\nI would conclude that (1) the trial court correctly fol-\nlowed the statute, and (2) there is sufficient evidence\nin the record to support the trial court\u2019s decision grant-\ning the plaintiff\u2019s application for an order of civil protec-\ntion pursuant to \u00a7 46b-16a. Accordingly, I would affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.1\n   I begin by setting forth the factual background of this\naction, as gleaned from the record. At all relevant times,\nthe plaintiff and the defendant were students at a com-\nmunity college, where they were both enrolled in the\ncollege\u2019s nursing program. On July 8, 2019, the plaintiff\nfiled an application for an order of civil protection. A\nhearing was held on the plaintiff\u2019s application on July\n22, 2019, at which both the plaintiff and the defendant\ntestified.\n   The plaintiff testified that she knew the defendant\nfrom school and that, on or about February 28, 2019,\nthe defendant had sent her an \u2018\u2018absurd amount of e-mails\nstating that, first, my marriage would have intervene[d]\nwith things between us . . . .\u2019\u2019 When asked whether\nshe was married, the plaintiff explained that she was\nnot and that, in an effort to get the defendant to stop\ncommunicating with her, she had lied to the defendant\nand told him that she was getting married. When asked\nwhether the defendant had made any statements to her\nthat made her fear for her personal safety, the plaintiff\nresponded yes. Specifically, she testified about an\ne-mail that the defendant had sent her on or about\nMarch 1, 2019, which stated: \u2018\u2018Honestly, I want to jump\non your back a little a rage and that would be dumb.\u2019\u2019\nThe plaintiff further testified that, on March 3, 2019,\nthe defendant sent her text messages about being sui-\ncidal, and that, on February 28, 2019, while in the pres-\nence of another person, he had made comments about\nher breasts that made her fearful of his conduct. With\nrespect to the comments about her breasts, the plaintiff\nstated that the defendant \u2018\u2018was being cocky and . . .\nwas trying to intimidate [her].\u2019\u2019 Although the plaintiff\nacknowledged that the communications from the defen-\ndant ceased after March 3, 2019, she testified in July,\n2019, that his communications with her caused her to\nfear for her personal safety, that she still feared for her\n\fpersonal safety, that she planned to attend classes at\nthe community college in the fall, and that she feared\nthat her safety would be at risk if she had any contact\nwith the defendant.\n   The defendant testified that, in the upcoming fall\nsemester, he did have classes with the plaintiff at the\ncommunity college. He also acknowledged that he suf-\nfers from \u2018\u2018a major depressive disorder,\u2019\u2019 which includes\nsuicidal thoughts. Although he claimed that the symp-\ntoms underlying the disorder are \u2018\u2018all controlled,\u2019\u2019 he\nalso acknowledged that all of the symptoms have \u2018\u2018not\ngone yet.\u2019\u2019\n  The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for an\norder of civil protection in an oral decision, stating\nthat the \u2018\u2018[s]tatute is very clear that indicates that such\nperson causes reasonable fear\u2014the conduct of the\ndefendant causes reasonable fear for the physical\nsafety.2 So she\u2019s made it very clear [that] she\u2019s very\napprehensive, her conduct on the stand indicated she\u2019s\nreliving some of these things. Things which, depending\non your level of threshold and thickness of skin, become\nmore or less significant. But, it\u2019s very clear that this is\nvery upsetting to her, and it\u2019s affected her ability to\ncarry on life\u2019s activities.\u2019\u2019 (Footnote added.) The court\nordered the defendant not to have any contact with the\nplaintiff and to stay 100 yards away from the plaintiff,\nand its order was effective for one year, until July 22,\n2020.3\n  The decision of the majority to reverse the judgment\nof the trial court hinges on the majority\u2019s conclusion\nthat (1) the trial court did not apply an objective stan-\ndard to the first element of stalking in its determination\nof \u2018\u2018reasonable fear,\u2019\u2019 and (2) \u2018\u2018the plaintiff presented\nno evidence that the defendant would continue to stalk\nher.\u2019\u20194 I disagree and would conclude, after \u2018\u2018allow[ing]\nevery reasonable presumption in favor of the correct-\nness of [the trial court\u2019s] action\u2019\u2019; (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) Kayla M. v.

In the present case, the tran-\nscript is replete with the defendant\u2019s admissions to his\ndeplorable conduct. These admissions would certainly\njustify the inference that the objective standard had\nbeen met.\n   In Kayla M. v. Greene, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">163 Conn.

Specifi-\ncally, this court found that the trial court had credited\nthe plaintiff\u2019s statements in her affidavit that she felt\nthreatened by the defendant Edward Greene after he\nhad grabbed her arm at her workplace and sent her a\nthreatening e-mail, and that the trial court reasonably\ncould have inferred, on the basis of those facts, that\nthe plaintiff feared for her physical safety. Id. Moreover,\nalthough Greene testified at the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s\napplication for a civil protection order that \u2018\u2018he had\nno intention of ever communicating with the plaintiff\nagain\u2019\u2019; id.; the trial court nevertheless found that he\nwas \u2018\u2018 \u2018unnaturally obsessed\u2019 \u2019\u2019 with the plaintiff, and it\nreasonably inferred, on the basis of that obsession, that\nhe \u2018\u2018would continue his previous course of conduct.\u2019\u2019\nId., 511, 512.\n  In the present case, the court reasonably could have\nfound, on the basis of the testimony presented, that\n\fthere were reasonable grounds to believe that the plain-\ntiff feared for her physical safety and that the defendant\nwould continue in his course of conduct. We do not\nexpect our trial judges to be soothsayers. All that is\nrequired is that there is a reasonable probability that\nthe defendant will repeat the reported conduct such\nthat there is a risk of imminent harm to the plaintiff.\nIn this case, I cannot say that the decision of the trial\ncourt was an abuse of discretion or that its finding\nregarding the plaintiff\u2019s clear apprehension of the defen-\ndant was clearly erroneous.\n  The record here clearly shows that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct toward the plaintiff was truly bizarre and fright-\nening. Clearly, the conduct was aberrant, obsessive,\nand delusional. He also threatened future assaultive\nconduct against the plaintiff when he said that he\nwanted to \u2018\u2018jump on [her] back,\u2019\u2019 in rage, even though\nhe acknowledged that \u2018\u2018that would be dumb.\u2019\u2019 He further\nindicated delusional behavior when, in response to the\nplaintiff\u2019s statement to him that she was getting married,\nhe stated that her marriage would interfere with their\nrelationship. There was no relationship between the\nplaintiff and the defendant. On the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s\ntestimony, however, the trial court reasonably could\nhave inferred that the defendant wanted more than a\nmere friendship and that the plaintiff must have realized\nthat, as she otherwise would not have invented the\nstory about being married.

Further, the\ncourt obviously did not choose to accept the defen-\ndant\u2019s testimony that his condition was under control\nwhen the hearing occurred only a few months after his\nbizarre acts and he was going to attend the same school\nwith the plaintiff in September.

Such\nan act of violence would certainly justify a trial judge\nto find that a protective order should issue to protect\nsomeone who had spurned him and against whom he\nhad made a threat to jump on her back in rage.\n   The threat of future conduct has to be a significant\nelement in any trial court\u2019s decision to issue a protective\norder, and there certainly was sufficient evidence of a\nprobability of future assaultive conduct here to cause\nreasonable fear in the plaintiff and to satisfy the objec-\ntive standard requirement. \u2018\u2018[A]n applicant for a civil\nprotection order on the basis of stalking pursuant to\n\u00a7 46b-16a must prove only that there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe that every element is met and that\nsuch conduct will continue. . . . In determining\nwhether there are reasonable grounds to believe that\nstalking occurred, it is instructive that, in the criminal\ncontext, [t]he phrase reasonable grounds to believe is\nsynonymous with probable cause. . . .

The defendant\u2019s credibility, or lack\nthereof, is a key element in this determination.\n   The majority concludes that it must reverse because\nthe court did not consider the objective standard and\nthere is no evidence of future conduct. I respectfully\ndisagree because of the defendant\u2019s threat of jumping\non the plaintiff\u2019s back in rage, his unwanted e-mails,\nthe comment about the plaintiff\u2019s breasts, and his over-\nall lack of credibility. I further disagree because it would\nbe the rare case in which a defendant testified that he\nwould keep doing the acts which brought him before\nthe court or told someone else to that effect. The defen-\ndant in this case engaged in obsessive behavior. At the\nhearing, he admitted that part of his major depressive\ndisorder has an obsessive component, namely, that he\nwould keep thinking about the same thing over and\nover. He further testified that his condition was not\nfully resolved, as he must take medication every night\nand get treatment from counselors and therapists.\nBecause he had threatened the plaintiff, his testimony\nthat he never thought about hurting anyone else is not\ncredible. In my view, reviewing both the evidence and\nthe reasonable inferences derived therefrom, there\nclearly was no abuse of discretion in this matter.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  1\n     Our Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue of whether a \u00a7 46b-\n16a protective order may be granted when (1) there is prior evidence of\ncriminal stalking, (2) there is a threat of a future criminal act, and (3) the\ndefendant\u2019s testimony is not credible.\n   2\n     The court clearly relied on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181e (a), which pro-\nvides that a person is guilty of stalking in the third degree when such person\n\u2018\u2018recklessly causes another person to reasonably . . . fear for his or her\nphysical safety . . . .\u2019\u2019\n   3\n     Although the order of civil protection has expired, the present appeal\nis not moot.

LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n                          SUMMARY **\n\n\n        Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n    The panel reversed the district court\u2019s denial of a\nstudent\u2019s parent\u2019s request for a \u201cstay put\u201d order under the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and remanded\nfor entry of a stay put order requiring the student\u2019s placement\nat an educational center at the expense of the defendant\nschool district.\n\n    In due process proceedings, an administrative law judge\nconcluded that the school district had failed to provide the\nstudent, who has Prader-Willi Syndrome, with a free\nappropriate public education because she required \u201ctotal\nfood security\u201d in a schoolwide environment to obtain a\nmeaningful educational benefit at school. As a remedy, the\nALJ ordered the student\u2019s placement at the educational\ncenter, which treats students with Prader-Willi Syndrome\nand provides total food security in the overall school\nenvironment, at the school district\u2019s expense. After the\nschool district failed either to appeal or to comply with the\nALJ\u2019s order, the student\u2019s parent sought a stay put order in\nthe district court. The district court denied a stay put order\nor preliminary injunction on the ground that the parent\nneeded to challenge in further administrative proceedings a\nSeptember 2020 individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d)\nnot covered by the ALJ\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It\nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                3\n\n    The IDEA\u2019s stay put provision provides that while an\nadministrative appeal or civil action filed by a \u201cparty\naggrieved\u201d by an ALJ\u2019s decision is ongoing, the student\nmust remain in her then-current educational placement. The\npanel held that a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) includes a parent, like the parent here, who\nis aggrieved by a school district\u2019s failure to either appeal or\ncomply with a final administrative order and who seeks court\nenforcement of that final administrative order. Accordingly,\nthe parent properly sought relief in the district court.\n\n    The panel held that the district court incorrectly\ninterpreted the ALJ order as providing two alternative\nsimultaneous remedies, rather than an immediate transfer to\nthe educational center, where the student was to remain, at\nthe school district\u2019s expense, until the ALJ determined that\na new IEP addressed all the perceived inadequacies in her\nprior setting.\n\n    The panel held that the district court also erred by failing\nto engage in an analysis of stay put and how the ALJ order\nchanged the student\u2019s placement. The panel held that under\nthe appropriate analysis, the ALJ order changed the student\u2019s\nlegal placement to the educational center. Accordingly,\nunder the IDEA\u2019s stay put provision, this new placement\nmust be made and maintained. The panel held that because\na stay put order functions as an automatic injunction,\nconsideration of irreparable harm or other traditional\npreliminary injunction factors was not necessary.\n\f4       S.C.

In this case, an\nadministrative law judge, after considering a due process\nchallenge to the educational program of a child with\ndisabilities, ordered that the child (\u201cS.C.\u201d) be placed at an\neducational center (the \u201cLatham Center\u201d) at the expense of\nthe Lincoln County School District (the \u201cschool district\u201d).\nAlthough the school district never appealed the order, it\nfailed to comply with the order. The child, by her mother\n(\u201cK.G.\u201d), therefore sought a stay put order from a federal\ndistrict court requiring that S.C. be placed at the Latham\nCenter at the school district\u2019s expense; but the district court\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT              5\n\ndenied the request. This was error, and, accordingly, we\nreverse and direct entry of the stay put order.\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n\nI. The IDEA\u2019s Procedural Safeguards\n\n    The IDEA allocates federal funds to states on the\ncondition, among others, that the state provide all children\nwith disabilities a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d\n(\u201cFAPE\u201d). 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). A school district\nprovides a FAPE to a child with disabilities by devising an\nindividualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) for each such\nchild. An IEP is a document that identifies the child\u2019s\nparticular educational needs, outlines the services required\nto meet those needs, and sets measurable goals for the child\u2019s\nprogress. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A). In any given case, the\nIEP is developed and regularly updated by the IEP \u201cteam,\u201d\nwhich involves the child\u2019s parent or guardian, a regular\neducation teacher, a special education teacher, a\nrepresentative of the local educational agency, and an expert\nregarding the child. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d).\n\n    In addition to setting out requirements for IEPs, the\nIDEA provides specific procedural safeguards in relation to\na school district\u2019s provision of a FAPE. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a).\nIf a parent is not satisfied with an IEP or has another\ncomplaint about the school district\u2019s provision of the FAPE,\nthe parent can initiate an administrative due process\nchallenge. In Oregon (where S.C. is located), the challenge\nproceeds before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who\nreviews the complaint, conducts a hearing, and can exercise\nbroad authority to order appropriate remedies, including\neducation services to be paid for by the school district. See\n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). The ALJ\u2019s decision is final\n\f6       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nand binding unless either party appeals. 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1415(i)(1)(A).\n\n    In addition to any administrative appeal, \u201c[a]ny party\naggrieved\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s findings and order \u201cshall have the\nright to bring a civil action\u201d with respect to the due process\ncomplaint in an appropriate state court or federal district\ncourt. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). However, while any such\nproceeding is ongoing, the IDEA includes a requirement that\nthe child remain in their then-current educational\nplacement\u2014a requirement known as the \u201cstay put\u201d\nprovision. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (\u201c[D]uring the pendency of\nany proceedings conducted pursuant to [\u00a7 1415], unless the\nState or local educational agency and the parents otherwise\nagree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational\nplacement of the child . . . .\u201d). As discussed below, however,\nDepartment of Education regulations deem an ALJ order to\nchange placement, if not appealed by the parent or local\neducational agency, as a de facto agreement to treat the situs\nof the court-ordered placement as the \u201cthen-current\u201d\nplacement. See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d).\n\n    Stay put functions as \u201can \u2018automatic\u2019 preliminary\ninjunction,\u201d and the moving party need not show the\ntraditionally required preliminary injunction factors to\nobtain relief. See Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified Sch. Dist.,\n559 F.3d 1036, 1037 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal citations\nomitted). And while stay put most commonly involves\nmaintaining the status quo, where a parent prevails in an\nadministrative hearing and an administrative ruling agrees\nwith the parent that a different placement is appropriate,\nthen, as noted, it is that new placement that must be made\nand maintained for purposes of the stay put provision. See\nBurlington v. Mass. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372\u201373\n(1985) (noting that a decision in the parent\u2019s favor in an\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT             7\n\nadministrative due process hearing, if not appealed, \u201cwould\nseem to constitute agreement by the State to the change of\nplacement\u201d); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d) (codifying Burlington\nthat \u201c[i]f the hearing officer in a due process hearing . . .\nagrees with the child\u2019s parents that a change of placement is\nappropriate, that placement must be treated as an agreement\nbetween the State and the parents for purposes of [stay\nput]\u201d).\n\nII. S.C.\u2019s Due Process Challenge\n\n    S.C. is a teenage girl who attends school in the\nDefendant-Appellee Lincoln County School District. S.C.\nhas a severe form of Prader-Willi Syndrome (\u201cPWS\u201d), a\ngenetic condition that disrupts the body\u2019s appetite control\nand causes anxiety, major depressive disorder, and\ndevelopmental delays. Because of PWS, S.C. experiences\nintense food-seeking thoughts that lead to poor impulse\ncontrol and behavioral issues, including verbal and physical\naggression. Because consistent and rigid routines concerning\nfood help control PWS, treatment for PWS typically\nincludes total food security (\u201cTFS\u201d), a system in which food\nis present at mealtimes but otherwise kept locked up and out\nof sight.\n\n    S.C. has been receiving special education services in the\nschool district since the 2015\u20132016 school year through the\nprovision of regularly updated IEPs. In May 2020, S.C.\u2019s\nmother, K.G., filed an administrative challenge claiming that\nthe school district was not providing a FAPE to S.C. While\nthis challenge was pending, the school district finalized a\nnew IEP for S.C. on September 18, 2020, approved by the\nIEP \u201cteam\u201d but not by S.C. or K.G. However, because the\nALJ\u2019s due process review is limited by law to the two years\npreceding the filing of the due process complaint, the ALJ\u2019s\nreview authority did not extend past May 21, 2020. 20\n\f8       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(c). As a result, and as the ALJ stated in\nher decision, the ALJ\u2019s ruling did not cover the September\n2020 IEP.\n\n    In October 2020, the ALJ conducted a remote hearing,\nspanning over fifty hours in total, on K.G.\u2019s due process\ncomplaint. On December 22, 2020, the ALJ issued a\nseventy-page decision, finding that the school district had\nnot provided S.C. a FAPE during the period under review\n(May 21, 2018 to May 21, 2020). In so finding, the ALJ\nconcluded, among other things, that S.C. required TFS in a\nschool-wide environment to obtain a meaningful educational\nbenefit at school, and that the previous IEPs only provided\nS.C. with TFS by placing her in a \u201cStructured Learning\nCenter\u201d removed from the regular school environment.\n\n   As a remedy for the school district\u2019s failure to provide a\nFAPE, the ALJ ordered that S.C. be placed at the Latham\nCenter, a residential facility that treats students with PWS\nand provides TFS in the overall school environment. The key\nprovision of the ALJ order reads as follows:\n\n       \u201cThe [School] District is to pay the cost of\n       enrolling the Student at the Latham Center,\n       including non-medical care, room and board,\n       for the period commencing on the first day of\n       the winter 2021 semester until the District\n       provides TFS in school-wide setting along\n       with an IEP which addresses all of the\n       inadequacies identified in this order or the\n       next annual IEP which appears to be\n       September 2021\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n   The school district did not appeal; but neither did it\ncomply with the order. Specifically, it failed to arrange for\nS.C. to be enrolled at the Latham Center at the school\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                9\n\ndistrict\u2019s expense. Accordingly, K.G., on behalf of S.C.,\nfiled suit in federal court on January 6, 2021, seeking a stay\nput order or preliminary injunction requiring the school\ndistrict to comply with the ALJ order and pay for S.C.\u2019s\nplacement at the Latham Center.\n\nIII.   The District Court\u2019s Denial of a Stay Put Order\n\n    On March 22, 2021, the district court issued an opinion\ndenying a stay put order or preliminary injunction on the\ngrounds that K.G. needed to challenge the September 2020\nIEP in further administrative proceedings. The district court\ndid not analyze how the ALJ order impacted stay put, but\ninstead focused on whether the September 2020 IEP\naddressed the deficiencies described in the ALJ\u2019s decision,\non who should so decide, and on what should happen until\nsuch a decision was made. The district court found that\nbecause the ALJ did not rule on whether the September 2020\nIEP would or would not actually address the deficiencies the\nALJ identified in the earlier IEPs, this question \u201cmust be\nanswered at the administrative level, and not on an expedited\nbasis during an emergency motion for a stay put order before\nthis Court.\u201d In other words, the district court incorrectly read\nthe issue as S.C. rushing to court before exhausting\nadministrative challenges to the September 2020 IEP, rather\nthan analyzing what was an emergency motion before the\ncourt for a stay put order to enforce a favorable ALJ ruling\nthat required S.C.\u2019s placement at the Latham Center pending\nfurther administrative or judicial proceedings. K.G. timely\nappealed.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n    We review a denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse\nof discretion. N.D. v. Haw. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., 600 F.3d\n1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Earth Island Inst. v. U.S.\n\f10       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nForest Serv., 351 F.3d 1291, 1298 (9th Cir. 2003)). This\nincludes a stay put order in IDEA proceedings. See N.E. v.\nSeattle Sch. Dist., 842 F.3d 1093, 1095\u201396 (9th Cir. 2016).\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the underlying legal\nprinciples, however, is subject to de novo review and a\ndistrict court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of\nlaw.\u201d E. E. v. Norris Sch. Dist., 4 F.4th 866, 871 (9th Cir.\n2021) (citing Sw. Voter Registration Educ. Project v.\nShelley, 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc)).\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\n    As a threshold matter, we find that a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d\nunder 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) includes a parent, like K.G.\nhere, who is aggrieved by a school district\u2019s failure to either\nappeal or comply with a final administrative order and who\nseeks court enforcement of that final administrative order.\nSee Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 115\u201316\n(1st Cir. 2003) (concluding \u201cthat Congress could not have\nintended to leave plaintiffs without an IDEA statutory\nremedy when they succeed before the hearing officer and the\nschool system does not appeal the administrative decision\nbut simply fails to fulfill a continuing obligation to provide\nservices\u201d). 1\n\n     The district court in this case made two errors of law:\nfirst, it incorrectly interpreted the ALJ order as providing\ntwo alternative simultaneous remedies, rather than an\nimmediate transfer to the Latham Center to be followed only\n\n\n     1\n      In their briefs, the parties question whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is\navailable to enforce an ALJ\u2019s administrative order providing relief under\nthe IDEA. Because we grant the relief sought under the IDEA, there is\nno need to address whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 may be available in some\nfuture case where it is necessary to provide a remedy.\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT             11\n\nlater by another alternative; and second, it did not engage in\nan analysis of stay put and how the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s\neducational placement.\n\nI. The Proper Interpretation of the ALJ Order\n\n    As noted, the ALJ order reads as follows: \u201cThe [School]\nDistrict is to pay the cost of enrolling the Student at the\nLatham Center, including non-medical care, room and\nboard, for the period commencing on the first day of the\nwinter 2021 semester until the District provides TFS in\nschool-wide setting along with an IEP which addresses all of\nthe inadequacies identified in this order or the next annual\nIEP which appears to be September 2021\u201d (emphasis added).\nFor at least four separate reasons, the ALJ order is properly\ninterpreted as providing a two-phase remedy, with the first\nphase being S.C.\u2019s immediate transfer to the Latham Center\non the first day of the winter 2021 semester, where S.C. is to\nremain, at the school district\u2019s expense, until the ALJ\ndetermines that a new IEP addresses all the perceived\ninadequacies in S.C.\u2019s prior setting.\n\n    First, the plain language of the order\u2014requiring\nplacement at the Latham Center \u201cuntil\u201d the school district\nprovides TFS schoolwide and an appropriate IEP\u2014indicates\na two-phased remedy, rather than two alternative remedies.\nBy using the word \u201cuntil,\u201d as well as contemplating that\nthere would be no further IEP until September 2021\n(although the school district wound up promulgating a new\nIEP in September 2020), the order clearly mandated S.C.\u2019s\nimmediate transfer to the Latham Center at the school\ndistrict\u2019s expense. Conversely, the order nowhere provided\nthat the transfer could be delayed by the school district\u2019s\nexpedient of issuing (prematurely) a new IEP, whose\nadequacy had yet to be addressed by the ALJ (or anyone\nelse).\n\f12      S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n    Second, interpreting the order as somehow providing\nsimultaneous alternative remedies is totally inconsistent\nwith the preceding sixty-nine pages of the ALJ decision,\nwhich explain why immediate placement at the Latham\nCenter is the appropriate step. K.G. had requested either\nplacement at the Latham Center or remedies related to the\nschool district\u2019s providing TFS and adequate IEPs. The ALJ\nordered only placement at the Latham Center and found it\n\u201cunnecessary\u201d to address the remedies related to TFS and\nIEPs in the school district \u201c[b]ecause this order provides for\nthe residential placement requested . . . .\u201d This further\nindicates that this was not an alternative or conditional\nremedy.\n\n     Third, the school district\u2019s argument below and on\nappeal\u2014that the school district could unilaterally nullify the\nfirst part of the ALJ order by developing the September 2020\nIEP\u2014is illogical and contrary to the IDEA\u2019s procedural\nsafeguards. Such an interpretation would effectively\ndelegate the ALJ\u2019s authority to the IEP team, undermining\nthe procedural safeguards outlined in the IDEA for due\nprocess challenges and administrative review. As the\nCircuits that have considered the issue have held, delegating\nthat determination to the IEP team does not comply with the\nIDEA\u2019s statutory scheme. M.S. v. Utah Sch. for the Deaf &\nBlind, 822 F.3d 1128, 1135 (10th Cir. 2016); Bd. of Educ. of\nFayette Cnty. v. L.M., 478 F.3d 307, 317\u201318 (6th Cir. 2007);\nReid ex rel. Reid v. District of Columbia, 401 F.3d 516, 521,\n526\u201327 (D.C. Cir. 2005). We agree.\n\n   Fourth and finally, considering the ALJ order\nconditional would require K.G. to file a new due process\nchallenge to the September 2020 IEP to receive the benefit\nfrom the favorable ruling in her previous due process\nchallenge, even though the September 2020 IEP was\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT               13\n\nnecessarily outside the two-year scope of the initial due\nprocess review, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C). This would\ncreate an impossible scenario for a parent, one that is\ninconsistent with the IDEA\u2019s statutory scheme providing\nspecific procedural safeguards. Such an interpretation would\ntrap parents in a never-ending cycle of due process\nchallenges, forcing them to file a new challenge each time a\nnew IEP is developed, without ever enjoying the benefit of a\nfavorable administrative ruling on a previous due process\nchallenge.\n\n    For the aforementioned reasons, the ALJ order here is\nproperly interpreted as laying out a two-part phased remedy,\nand the district court erred in considering the order as\nproviding for simultaneous alternative remedies, as well as\nin requiring K.G. to file a new administrative challenge to\nthe September 2020 IEP.\n\nII. Stay Put Requires S.C.\u2019s Placement at Latham at\n    LCSD\u2019s Expense\n\n    The district court also erred in failing to analyze stay put\nand how the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s educational\nplacement. As set out in the Department of Education\u2019s\nimplementing regulations, \u201c[i]f the hearing officer in a due\nprocess hearing . . . agrees with the child\u2019s parents that a\nchange of placement is appropriate, that placement must be\ntreated as an agreement between the State and the parents for\npurposes of [stay put].\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d).\nFurthermore, as this Court discussed in L.M. v. Capistrano\nUnified School District, \u201c[w]here the agency or the court has\nruled on the appropriateness of the educational placement in\nthe parents\u2019 favor, the school district is responsible for\nappropriate private education costs . . . .\u201d 556 F.3d 900, 912\n\f14       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n(9th Cir. 2009) (discussing other Circuits\u2019 cases holding the\nsame). 2\n\n    The stay put order analysis in this case is thus quite\nstraightforward. The district court simply failed to ask how\nthe ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s educational placement. The\nfinal and unappealed ALJ order, which required the school\ndistrict to pay for S.C. to be placed at the Latham Center on\nthe first day of the winter semester 2021, constituted an\nagreement between the state and S.C.\u2019s parent for purposes\nof the stay put provision. As such, S.C.\u2019s legal placement\nchanged to the Latham Center, either when the ALJ order\nissued on December 22, 2020, or, at worst, on the first day\nof the winter semester 2021. Because the stay put order\nfunctions as an automatic injunction, consideration of\nirreparable harm or other traditional preliminary injunction\nfactors is not necessary.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n\n     As described above, the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s\neducational placement to the Latham Center. This Court thus\nreverses and remands with instructions to enter a stay put\norder to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order requiring S.C.\u2019s placement\nat the Latham Center, at the school district\u2019s expense, \u201cuntil\nthe [School] District provides TFS in school-wide setting\nalong with an IEP which addresses all of the inadequacies\n\n\n\n     2\n      While in Capistrano this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial\nof a stay put order on the grounds that there had not yet been an\nadministrative or court decision on the actual merits of the child\u2019s\nplacement, 556 F.3d at 912\u201313, its reasoning compels the opposite\nconclusion under the facts of this case, as S.C. did, in fact, receive a\nfavorable ALJ ruling on her due process challenge.\n\f         S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                      15\n\nidentified in this order . . . .\u201d 3 To be sure, further\nproceedings, whether judicial or administrative, may\nconsider whether the school district is providing TFS\nschoolwide, as well as whether a new IEP (either the\nSeptember 2020 IEP or a subsequent IEP) provides a FAPE\nthat cures the deficiencies in previous IEPs that the ALJ\norder identifies. Unless and until, however, the conclusion\nof such proceedings changes S.C.\u2019s educational placement,\nshe must be placed at the Latham Center and remain there at\nthe school district\u2019s expense.\n\n   REVERSED                AND         REMANDED,                WITH\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      However, to the extent that S.C. asks for placement at the Latham\nCenter for one year as compensatory education, such an order is not\nwarranted under the terms of the ALJ order. The ALJ order found that to\nthe extent that K.G. was still requesting compensatory education, K.G.\n\u201chas not presented sufficient evidence to support the request.\u201d S.C. and\nK.G. cannot argue against the district court\u2019s effective rewriting of the\nALJ order and then ask this Court to rewrite a different part of that ALJ\norder to award a new remedy, one that the ALJ explicitly rejected.\n\f",

LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n                          SUMMARY **\n\n\n        Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n    The panel reversed the district court\u2019s denial of a\nstudent\u2019s parent\u2019s request for a \u201cstay put\u201d order under the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and remanded\nfor entry of a stay put order requiring the student\u2019s placement\nat an educational center at the expense of the defendant\nschool district.\n\n    In due process proceedings, an administrative law judge\nconcluded that the school district had failed to provide the\nstudent, who has Prader-Willi Syndrome, with a free\nappropriate public education because she required \u201ctotal\nfood security\u201d in a schoolwide environment to obtain a\nmeaningful educational benefit at school. As a remedy, the\nALJ ordered the student\u2019s placement at the educational\ncenter, which treats students with Prader-Willi Syndrome\nand provides total food security in the overall school\nenvironment, at the school district\u2019s expense. After the\nschool district failed either to appeal or to comply with the\nALJ\u2019s order, the student\u2019s parent sought a stay put order in\nthe district court. The district court denied a stay put order\nor preliminary injunction on the ground that the parent\nneeded to challenge in further administrative proceedings a\nSeptember 2020 individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d)\nnot covered by the ALJ\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It\nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                3\n\n    The IDEA\u2019s stay put provision provides that while an\nadministrative appeal or civil action filed by a \u201cparty\naggrieved\u201d by an ALJ\u2019s decision is ongoing, the student\nmust remain in her then-current educational placement. The\npanel held that a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) includes a parent, like the parent here, who\nis aggrieved by a school district\u2019s failure to either appeal or\ncomply with a final administrative order and who seeks court\nenforcement of that final administrative order. Accordingly,\nthe parent properly sought relief in the district court.\n\n    The panel held that the district court incorrectly\ninterpreted the ALJ order as providing two alternative\nsimultaneous remedies, rather than an immediate transfer to\nthe educational center, where the student was to remain, at\nthe school district\u2019s expense, until the ALJ determined that\na new IEP addressed all the perceived inadequacies in her\nprior setting.\n\n    The panel held that the district court also erred by failing\nto engage in an analysis of stay put and how the ALJ order\nchanged the student\u2019s placement. The panel held that under\nthe appropriate analysis, the ALJ order changed the student\u2019s\nlegal placement to the educational center. Accordingly,\nunder the IDEA\u2019s stay put provision, this new placement\nmust be made and maintained. The panel held that because\na stay put order functions as an automatic injunction,\nconsideration of irreparable harm or other traditional\npreliminary injunction factors was not necessary.\n\f4       S.C.

Nelson, Nelson Koster, Tampa, Florida;\nAndr\u00e9e Larose, Morrison Sherwood Wilson Deola PLLP,\nHelena, Montana; for Plaintiff-Appellant.\n\nNancy J. Hungerford (argued) and Richard G. Cohn-Lee,\nHungerford Law Firm, Oregon City, Oregon, for Defendant-\nAppellee.\n\nEllen Marjorie Saideman (argued), Law Office of Ellen\nSaideman, Barrington, Rhode Island; Selene Almazan-\nAltobelli, Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc.,\nTowson, Maryland; for Amicus Curiae Council of Parent\nAttorneys and Advocates, Inc.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nRAKOFF, District Judge:\n\n    This case asks us to consider the application of the so-\ncalled \u201cstay put\u201d provision of the Individuals with\nDisabilities in Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d). In this case, an\nadministrative law judge, after considering a due process\nchallenge to the educational program of a child with\ndisabilities, ordered that the child (\u201cS.C.\u201d) be placed at an\neducational center (the \u201cLatham Center\u201d) at the expense of\nthe Lincoln County School District (the \u201cschool district\u201d).\nAlthough the school district never appealed the order, it\nfailed to comply with the order. The child, by her mother\n(\u201cK.G.\u201d), therefore sought a stay put order from a federal\ndistrict court requiring that S.C. be placed at the Latham\nCenter at the school district\u2019s expense; but the district court\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT              5\n\ndenied the request. This was error, and, accordingly, we\nreverse and direct entry of the stay put order.\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n\nI. The IDEA\u2019s Procedural Safeguards\n\n    The IDEA allocates federal funds to states on the\ncondition, among others, that the state provide all children\nwith disabilities a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d\n(\u201cFAPE\u201d). 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). A school district\nprovides a FAPE to a child with disabilities by devising an\nindividualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) for each such\nchild. An IEP is a document that identifies the child\u2019s\nparticular educational needs, outlines the services required\nto meet those needs, and sets measurable goals for the child\u2019s\nprogress. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A). In any given case, the\nIEP is developed and regularly updated by the IEP \u201cteam,\u201d\nwhich involves the child\u2019s parent or guardian, a regular\neducation teacher, a special education teacher, a\nrepresentative of the local educational agency, and an expert\nregarding the child. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d).\n\n    In addition to setting out requirements for IEPs, the\nIDEA provides specific procedural safeguards in relation to\na school district\u2019s provision of a FAPE. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a).\nIf a parent is not satisfied with an IEP or has another\ncomplaint about the school district\u2019s provision of the FAPE,\nthe parent can initiate an administrative due process\nchallenge. In Oregon (where S.C. is located), the challenge\nproceeds before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who\nreviews the complaint, conducts a hearing, and can exercise\nbroad authority to order appropriate remedies, including\neducation services to be paid for by the school district. See\n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). The ALJ\u2019s decision is final\n\f6       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nand binding unless either party appeals. 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1415(i)(1)(A).\n\n    In addition to any administrative appeal, \u201c[a]ny party\naggrieved\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s findings and order \u201cshall have the\nright to bring a civil action\u201d with respect to the due process\ncomplaint in an appropriate state court or federal district\ncourt. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). However, while any such\nproceeding is ongoing, the IDEA includes a requirement that\nthe child remain in their then-current educational\nplacement\u2014a requirement known as the \u201cstay put\u201d\nprovision. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (\u201c[D]uring the pendency of\nany proceedings conducted pursuant to [\u00a7 1415], unless the\nState or local educational agency and the parents otherwise\nagree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational\nplacement of the child . . . .\u201d). As discussed below, however,\nDepartment of Education regulations deem an ALJ order to\nchange placement, if not appealed by the parent or local\neducational agency, as a de facto agreement to treat the situs\nof the court-ordered placement as the \u201cthen-current\u201d\nplacement. See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d).\n\n    Stay put functions as \u201can \u2018automatic\u2019 preliminary\ninjunction,\u201d and the moving party need not show the\ntraditionally required preliminary injunction factors to\nobtain relief. See Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified Sch. Dist.,\n559 F.3d 1036, 1037 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal citations\nomitted). And while stay put most commonly involves\nmaintaining the status quo, where a parent prevails in an\nadministrative hearing and an administrative ruling agrees\nwith the parent that a different placement is appropriate,\nthen, as noted, it is that new placement that must be made\nand maintained for purposes of the stay put provision. See\nBurlington v. Mass. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 372\u201373\n(1985) (noting that a decision in the parent\u2019s favor in an\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT             7\n\nadministrative due process hearing, if not appealed, \u201cwould\nseem to constitute agreement by the State to the change of\nplacement\u201d); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d) (codifying Burlington\nthat \u201c[i]f the hearing officer in a due process hearing . . .\nagrees with the child\u2019s parents that a change of placement is\nappropriate, that placement must be treated as an agreement\nbetween the State and the parents for purposes of [stay\nput]\u201d).\n\nII. S.C.\u2019s Due Process Challenge\n\n    S.C. is a teenage girl who attends school in the\nDefendant-Appellee Lincoln County School District. S.C.\nhas a severe form of Prader-Willi Syndrome (\u201cPWS\u201d), a\ngenetic condition that disrupts the body\u2019s appetite control\nand causes anxiety, major depressive disorder, and\ndevelopmental delays. Because of PWS, S.C. experiences\nintense food-seeking thoughts that lead to poor impulse\ncontrol and behavioral issues, including verbal and physical\naggression. Because consistent and rigid routines concerning\nfood help control PWS, treatment for PWS typically\nincludes total food security (\u201cTFS\u201d), a system in which food\nis present at mealtimes but otherwise kept locked up and out\nof sight.\n\n    S.C. has been receiving special education services in the\nschool district since the 2015\u20132016 school year through the\nprovision of regularly updated IEPs. In May 2020, S.C.\u2019s\nmother, K.G., filed an administrative challenge claiming that\nthe school district was not providing a FAPE to S.C. While\nthis challenge was pending, the school district finalized a\nnew IEP for S.C. on September 18, 2020, approved by the\nIEP \u201cteam\u201d but not by S.C. or K.G. However, because the\nALJ\u2019s due process review is limited by law to the two years\npreceding the filing of the due process complaint, the ALJ\u2019s\nreview authority did not extend past May 21, 2020. 20\n\f8       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(c). As a result, and as the ALJ stated in\nher decision, the ALJ\u2019s ruling did not cover the September\n2020 IEP.\n\n    In October 2020, the ALJ conducted a remote hearing,\nspanning over fifty hours in total, on K.G.\u2019s due process\ncomplaint. On December 22, 2020, the ALJ issued a\nseventy-page decision, finding that the school district had\nnot provided S.C. a FAPE during the period under review\n(May 21, 2018 to May 21, 2020). In so finding, the ALJ\nconcluded, among other things, that S.C. required TFS in a\nschool-wide environment to obtain a meaningful educational\nbenefit at school, and that the previous IEPs only provided\nS.C. with TFS by placing her in a \u201cStructured Learning\nCenter\u201d removed from the regular school environment.\n\n   As a remedy for the school district\u2019s failure to provide a\nFAPE, the ALJ ordered that S.C. be placed at the Latham\nCenter, a residential facility that treats students with PWS\nand provides TFS in the overall school environment. The key\nprovision of the ALJ order reads as follows:\n\n       \u201cThe [School] District is to pay the cost of\n       enrolling the Student at the Latham Center,\n       including non-medical care, room and board,\n       for the period commencing on the first day of\n       the winter 2021 semester until the District\n       provides TFS in school-wide setting along\n       with an IEP which addresses all of the\n       inadequacies identified in this order or the\n       next annual IEP which appears to be\n       September 2021\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n   The school district did not appeal; but neither did it\ncomply with the order. Specifically, it failed to arrange for\nS.C. to be enrolled at the Latham Center at the school\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                9\n\ndistrict\u2019s expense. Accordingly, K.G., on behalf of S.C.,\nfiled suit in federal court on January 6, 2021, seeking a stay\nput order or preliminary injunction requiring the school\ndistrict to comply with the ALJ order and pay for S.C.\u2019s\nplacement at the Latham Center.\n\nIII.   The District Court\u2019s Denial of a Stay Put Order\n\n    On March 22, 2021, the district court issued an opinion\ndenying a stay put order or preliminary injunction on the\ngrounds that K.G. needed to challenge the September 2020\nIEP in further administrative proceedings. The district court\ndid not analyze how the ALJ order impacted stay put, but\ninstead focused on whether the September 2020 IEP\naddressed the deficiencies described in the ALJ\u2019s decision,\non who should so decide, and on what should happen until\nsuch a decision was made. The district court found that\nbecause the ALJ did not rule on whether the September 2020\nIEP would or would not actually address the deficiencies the\nALJ identified in the earlier IEPs, this question \u201cmust be\nanswered at the administrative level, and not on an expedited\nbasis during an emergency motion for a stay put order before\nthis Court.\u201d In other words, the district court incorrectly read\nthe issue as S.C. rushing to court before exhausting\nadministrative challenges to the September 2020 IEP, rather\nthan analyzing what was an emergency motion before the\ncourt for a stay put order to enforce a favorable ALJ ruling\nthat required S.C.\u2019s placement at the Latham Center pending\nfurther administrative or judicial proceedings. K.G. timely\nappealed.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n    We review a denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse\nof discretion. N.D. v. Haw. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., 600 F.3d\n1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Earth Island Inst. v. U.S.\n\f10       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nForest Serv., 351 F.3d 1291, 1298 (9th Cir. 2003)). This\nincludes a stay put order in IDEA proceedings. See N.E. v.\nSeattle Sch. Dist., 842 F.3d 1093, 1095\u201396 (9th Cir. 2016).\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the underlying legal\nprinciples, however, is subject to de novo review and a\ndistrict court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of\nlaw.\u201d E. E. v. Norris Sch. Dist., 4 F.4th 866, 871 (9th Cir.\n2021) (citing Sw. Voter Registration Educ. Project v.\nShelley, 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc)).\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\n    As a threshold matter, we find that a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d\nunder 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) includes a parent, like K.G.\nhere, who is aggrieved by a school district\u2019s failure to either\nappeal or comply with a final administrative order and who\nseeks court enforcement of that final administrative order.\nSee Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 115\u201316\n(1st Cir. 2003) (concluding \u201cthat Congress could not have\nintended to leave plaintiffs without an IDEA statutory\nremedy when they succeed before the hearing officer and the\nschool system does not appeal the administrative decision\nbut simply fails to fulfill a continuing obligation to provide\nservices\u201d). 1\n\n     The district court in this case made two errors of law:\nfirst, it incorrectly interpreted the ALJ order as providing\ntwo alternative simultaneous remedies, rather than an\nimmediate transfer to the Latham Center to be followed only\n\n\n     1\n      In their briefs, the parties question whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is\navailable to enforce an ALJ\u2019s administrative order providing relief under\nthe IDEA. Because we grant the relief sought under the IDEA, there is\nno need to address whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 may be available in some\nfuture case where it is necessary to provide a remedy.\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT             11\n\nlater by another alternative; and second, it did not engage in\nan analysis of stay put and how the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s\neducational placement.\n\nI. The Proper Interpretation of the ALJ Order\n\n    As noted, the ALJ order reads as follows: \u201cThe [School]\nDistrict is to pay the cost of enrolling the Student at the\nLatham Center, including non-medical care, room and\nboard, for the period commencing on the first day of the\nwinter 2021 semester until the District provides TFS in\nschool-wide setting along with an IEP which addresses all of\nthe inadequacies identified in this order or the next annual\nIEP which appears to be September 2021\u201d (emphasis added).\nFor at least four separate reasons, the ALJ order is properly\ninterpreted as providing a two-phase remedy, with the first\nphase being S.C.\u2019s immediate transfer to the Latham Center\non the first day of the winter 2021 semester, where S.C. is to\nremain, at the school district\u2019s expense, until the ALJ\ndetermines that a new IEP addresses all the perceived\ninadequacies in S.C.\u2019s prior setting.\n\n    First, the plain language of the order\u2014requiring\nplacement at the Latham Center \u201cuntil\u201d the school district\nprovides TFS schoolwide and an appropriate IEP\u2014indicates\na two-phased remedy, rather than two alternative remedies.\nBy using the word \u201cuntil,\u201d as well as contemplating that\nthere would be no further IEP until September 2021\n(although the school district wound up promulgating a new\nIEP in September 2020), the order clearly mandated S.C.\u2019s\nimmediate transfer to the Latham Center at the school\ndistrict\u2019s expense. Conversely, the order nowhere provided\nthat the transfer could be delayed by the school district\u2019s\nexpedient of issuing (prematurely) a new IEP, whose\nadequacy had yet to be addressed by the ALJ (or anyone\nelse).\n\f12      S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n    Second, interpreting the order as somehow providing\nsimultaneous alternative remedies is totally inconsistent\nwith the preceding sixty-nine pages of the ALJ decision,\nwhich explain why immediate placement at the Latham\nCenter is the appropriate step. K.G. had requested either\nplacement at the Latham Center or remedies related to the\nschool district\u2019s providing TFS and adequate IEPs. The ALJ\nordered only placement at the Latham Center and found it\n\u201cunnecessary\u201d to address the remedies related to TFS and\nIEPs in the school district \u201c[b]ecause this order provides for\nthe residential placement requested . . . .\u201d This further\nindicates that this was not an alternative or conditional\nremedy.\n\n     Third, the school district\u2019s argument below and on\nappeal\u2014that the school district could unilaterally nullify the\nfirst part of the ALJ order by developing the September 2020\nIEP\u2014is illogical and contrary to the IDEA\u2019s procedural\nsafeguards. Such an interpretation would effectively\ndelegate the ALJ\u2019s authority to the IEP team, undermining\nthe procedural safeguards outlined in the IDEA for due\nprocess challenges and administrative review. As the\nCircuits that have considered the issue have held, delegating\nthat determination to the IEP team does not comply with the\nIDEA\u2019s statutory scheme. M.S. v. Utah Sch. for the Deaf &\nBlind, 822 F.3d 1128, 1135 (10th Cir. 2016); Bd. of Educ. of\nFayette Cnty. v. L.M., 478 F.3d 307, 317\u201318 (6th Cir. 2007);\nReid ex rel. Reid v. District of Columbia, 401 F.3d 516, 521,\n526\u201327 (D.C. Cir. 2005). We agree.\n\n   Fourth and finally, considering the ALJ order\nconditional would require K.G. to file a new due process\nchallenge to the September 2020 IEP to receive the benefit\nfrom the favorable ruling in her previous due process\nchallenge, even though the September 2020 IEP was\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT               13\n\nnecessarily outside the two-year scope of the initial due\nprocess review, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C). This would\ncreate an impossible scenario for a parent, one that is\ninconsistent with the IDEA\u2019s statutory scheme providing\nspecific procedural safeguards. Such an interpretation would\ntrap parents in a never-ending cycle of due process\nchallenges, forcing them to file a new challenge each time a\nnew IEP is developed, without ever enjoying the benefit of a\nfavorable administrative ruling on a previous due process\nchallenge.\n\n    For the aforementioned reasons, the ALJ order here is\nproperly interpreted as laying out a two-part phased remedy,\nand the district court erred in considering the order as\nproviding for simultaneous alternative remedies, as well as\nin requiring K.G. to file a new administrative challenge to\nthe September 2020 IEP.\n\nII. Stay Put Requires S.C.\u2019s Placement at Latham at\n    LCSD\u2019s Expense\n\n    The district court also erred in failing to analyze stay put\nand how the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s educational\nplacement. As set out in the Department of Education\u2019s\nimplementing regulations, \u201c[i]f the hearing officer in a due\nprocess hearing . . . agrees with the child\u2019s parents that a\nchange of placement is appropriate, that placement must be\ntreated as an agreement between the State and the parents for\npurposes of [stay put].\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d).\nFurthermore, as this Court discussed in L.M. v. Capistrano\nUnified School District, \u201c[w]here the agency or the court has\nruled on the appropriateness of the educational placement in\nthe parents\u2019 favor, the school district is responsible for\nappropriate private education costs . . . .\u201d 556 F.3d 900, 912\n\f14       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n(9th Cir. 2009) (discussing other Circuits\u2019 cases holding the\nsame). 2\n\n    The stay put order analysis in this case is thus quite\nstraightforward. The district court simply failed to ask how\nthe ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s educational placement. The\nfinal and unappealed ALJ order, which required the school\ndistrict to pay for S.C. to be placed at the Latham Center on\nthe first day of the winter semester 2021, constituted an\nagreement between the state and S.C.\u2019s parent for purposes\nof the stay put provision. As such, S.C.\u2019s legal placement\nchanged to the Latham Center, either when the ALJ order\nissued on December 22, 2020, or, at worst, on the first day\nof the winter semester 2021. Because the stay put order\nfunctions as an automatic injunction, consideration of\nirreparable harm or other traditional preliminary injunction\nfactors is not necessary.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n\n     As described above, the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s\neducational placement to the Latham Center. This Court thus\nreverses and remands with instructions to enter a stay put\norder to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order requiring S.C.\u2019s placement\nat the Latham Center, at the school district\u2019s expense, \u201cuntil\nthe [School] District provides TFS in school-wide setting\nalong with an IEP which addresses all of the inadequacies\n\n\n\n     2\n      While in Capistrano this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial\nof a stay put order on the grounds that there had not yet been an\nadministrative or court decision on the actual merits of the child\u2019s\nplacement, 556 F.3d at 912\u201313, its reasoning compels the opposite\nconclusion under the facts of this case, as S.C. did, in fact, receive a\nfavorable ALJ ruling on her due process challenge.\n\f         S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                      15\n\nidentified in this order . . . .\u201d 3 To be sure, further\nproceedings, whether judicial or administrative, may\nconsider whether the school district is providing TFS\nschoolwide, as well as whether a new IEP (either the\nSeptember 2020 IEP or a subsequent IEP) provides a FAPE\nthat cures the deficiencies in previous IEPs that the ALJ\norder identifies. Unless and until, however, the conclusion\nof such proceedings changes S.C.\u2019s educational placement,\nshe must be placed at the Latham Center and remain there at\nthe school district\u2019s expense.\n\n   REVERSED                AND         REMANDED,                WITH\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      However, to the extent that S.C. asks for placement at the Latham\nCenter for one year as compensatory education, such an order is not\nwarranted under the terms of the ALJ order. The ALJ order found that to\nthe extent that K.G. was still requesting compensatory education, K.G.\n\u201chas not presented sufficient evidence to support the request.\u201d S.C. and\nK.G. cannot argue against the district court\u2019s effective rewriting of the\nALJ order and then ask this Court to rewrite a different part of that ALJ\norder to award a new remedy, one that the ALJ explicitly rejected.\n\f",

Wallace Tashima and Ronald M. Gould, Circuit\n        Judges, and Jed S. Rakoff, * District Judge.\n\n                    Opinion by Judge Rakoff\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      The Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Judge for the\nSouthern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n\f2        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n                          SUMMARY **\n\n\n        Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n    The panel reversed the district court\u2019s denial of a\nstudent\u2019s parent\u2019s request for a \u201cstay put\u201d order under the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and remanded\nfor entry of a stay put order requiring the student\u2019s placement\nat an educational center at the expense of the defendant\nschool district.\n\n    In due process proceedings, an administrative law judge\nconcluded that the school district had failed to provide the\nstudent, who has Prader-Willi Syndrome, with a free\nappropriate public education because she required \u201ctotal\nfood security\u201d in a schoolwide environment to obtain a\nmeaningful educational benefit at school. As a remedy, the\nALJ ordered the student\u2019s placement at the educational\ncenter, which treats students with Prader-Willi Syndrome\nand provides total food security in the overall school\nenvironment, at the school district\u2019s expense. After the\nschool district failed either to appeal or to comply with the\nALJ\u2019s order, the student\u2019s parent sought a stay put order in\nthe district court. The district court denied a stay put order\nor preliminary injunction on the ground that the parent\nneeded to challenge in further administrative proceedings a\nSeptember 2020 individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d)\nnot covered by the ALJ\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It\nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                3\n\n    The IDEA\u2019s stay put provision provides that while an\nadministrative appeal or civil action filed by a \u201cparty\naggrieved\u201d by an ALJ\u2019s decision is ongoing, the student\nmust remain in her then-current educational placement. The\npanel held that a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) includes a parent, like the parent here, who\nis aggrieved by a school district\u2019s failure to either appeal or\ncomply with a final administrative order and who seeks court\nenforcement of that final administrative order. Accordingly,\nthe parent properly sought relief in the district court.\n\n    The panel held that the district court incorrectly\ninterpreted the ALJ order as providing two alternative\nsimultaneous remedies, rather than an immediate transfer to\nthe educational center, where the student was to remain, at\nthe school district\u2019s expense, until the ALJ determined that\na new IEP addressed all the perceived inadequacies in her\nprior setting.\n\n    The panel held that the district court also erred by failing\nto engage in an analysis of stay put and how the ALJ order\nchanged the student\u2019s placement. The panel held that under\nthe appropriate analysis, the ALJ order changed the student\u2019s\nlegal placement to the educational center. Accordingly,\nunder the IDEA\u2019s stay put provision, this new placement\nmust be made and maintained. The panel held that because\na stay put order functions as an automatic injunction,\nconsideration of irreparable harm or other traditional\npreliminary injunction factors was not necessary.\n\f4       S.C.

In this case, an\nadministrative law judge, after considering a due process\nchallenge to the educational program of a child with\ndisabilities, ordered that the child (\u201cS.C.\u201d) be placed at an\neducational center (the \u201cLatham Center\u201d) at the expense of\nthe Lincoln County School District (the \u201cschool district\u201d).\nAlthough the school district never appealed the order, it\nfailed to comply with the order. The child, by her mother\n(\u201cK.G.\u201d), therefore sought a stay put order from a federal\ndistrict court requiring that S.C. be placed at the Latham\nCenter at the school district\u2019s expense; but the district court\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT              5\n\ndenied the request. This was error, and, accordingly, we\nreverse and direct entry of the stay put order.\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n\nI. The IDEA\u2019s Procedural Safeguards\n\n    The IDEA allocates federal funds to states on the\ncondition, among others, that the state provide all children\nwith disabilities a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d\n(\u201cFAPE\u201d). 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). A school district\nprovides a FAPE to a child with disabilities by devising an\nindividualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) for each such\nchild. An IEP is a document that identifies the child\u2019s\nparticular educational needs, outlines the services required\nto meet those needs, and sets measurable goals for the child\u2019s\nprogress. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A). In any given case, the\nIEP is developed and regularly updated by the IEP \u201cteam,\u201d\nwhich involves the child\u2019s parent or guardian, a regular\neducation teacher, a special education teacher, a\nrepresentative of the local educational agency, and an expert\nregarding the child. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d).\n\n    In addition to setting out requirements for IEPs, the\nIDEA provides specific procedural safeguards in relation to\na school district\u2019s provision of a FAPE. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a).\nIf a parent is not satisfied with an IEP or has another\ncomplaint about the school district\u2019s provision of the FAPE,\nthe parent can initiate an administrative due process\nchallenge. In Oregon (where S.C. is located), the challenge\nproceeds before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who\nreviews the complaint, conducts a hearing, and can exercise\nbroad authority to order appropriate remedies, including\neducation services to be paid for by the school district. See\n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). The ALJ\u2019s decision is final\n\f6       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nand binding unless either party appeals. 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1415(i)(1)(A).\n\n    In addition to any administrative appeal, \u201c[a]ny party\naggrieved\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s findings and order \u201cshall have the\nright to bring a civil action\u201d with respect to the due process\ncomplaint in an appropriate state court or federal district\ncourt. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). However, while any such\nproceeding is ongoing, the IDEA includes a requirement that\nthe child remain in their then-current educational\nplacement\u2014a requirement known as the \u201cstay put\u201d\nprovision. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (\u201c[D]uring the pendency of\nany proceedings conducted pursuant to [\u00a7 1415], unless the\nState or local educational agency and the parents otherwise\nagree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational\nplacement of the child . . . .\u201d). As discussed below, however,\nDepartment of Education regulations deem an ALJ order to\nchange placement, if not appealed by the parent or local\neducational agency, as a de facto agreement to treat the situs\nof the court-ordered placement as the \u201cthen-current\u201d\nplacement. See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d).\n\n    Stay put functions as \u201can \u2018automatic\u2019 preliminary\ninjunction,\u201d and the moving party need not show the\ntraditionally required preliminary injunction factors to\nobtain relief.

And while stay put most commonly involves\nmaintaining the status quo, where a parent prevails in an\nadministrative hearing and an administrative ruling agrees\nwith the parent that a different placement is appropriate,\nthen, as noted, it is that new placement that must be made\nand maintained for purposes of the stay put provision.

S.C.\u2019s Due Process Challenge\n\n    S.C. is a teenage girl who attends school in the\nDefendant-Appellee Lincoln County School District. S.C.\nhas a severe form of Prader-Willi Syndrome (\u201cPWS\u201d), a\ngenetic condition that disrupts the body\u2019s appetite control\nand causes anxiety, major depressive disorder, and\ndevelopmental delays. Because of PWS, S.C. experiences\nintense food-seeking thoughts that lead to poor impulse\ncontrol and behavioral issues, including verbal and physical\naggression. Because consistent and rigid routines concerning\nfood help control PWS, treatment for PWS typically\nincludes total food security (\u201cTFS\u201d), a system in which food\nis present at mealtimes but otherwise kept locked up and out\nof sight.\n\n    S.C. has been receiving special education services in the\nschool district since the 2015\u20132016 school year through the\nprovision of regularly updated IEPs. In May 2020, S.C.\u2019s\nmother, K.G., filed an administrative challenge claiming that\nthe school district was not providing a FAPE to S.C. While\nthis challenge was pending, the school district finalized a\nnew IEP for S.C. on September 18, 2020, approved by the\nIEP \u201cteam\u201d but not by S.C. or K.G. However, because the\nALJ\u2019s due process review is limited by law to the two years\npreceding the filing of the due process complaint, the ALJ\u2019s\nreview authority did not extend past May 21, 2020. 20\n\f8       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(c). As a result, and as the ALJ stated in\nher decision, the ALJ\u2019s ruling did not cover the September\n2020 IEP.\n\n    In October 2020, the ALJ conducted a remote hearing,\nspanning over fifty hours in total, on K.G.\u2019s due process\ncomplaint. On December 22, 2020, the ALJ issued a\nseventy-page decision, finding that the school district had\nnot provided S.C. a FAPE during the period under review\n(May 21, 2018 to May 21, 2020). In so finding, the ALJ\nconcluded, among other things, that S.C. required TFS in a\nschool-wide environment to obtain a meaningful educational\nbenefit at school, and that the previous IEPs only provided\nS.C. with TFS by placing her in a \u201cStructured Learning\nCenter\u201d removed from the regular school environment.\n\n   As a remedy for the school district\u2019s failure to provide a\nFAPE, the ALJ ordered that S.C. be placed at the Latham\nCenter, a residential facility that treats students with PWS\nand provides TFS in the overall school environment. The key\nprovision of the ALJ order reads as follows:\n\n       \u201cThe [School] District is to pay the cost of\n       enrolling the Student at the Latham Center,\n       including non-medical care, room and board,\n       for the period commencing on the first day of\n       the winter 2021 semester until the District\n       provides TFS in school-wide setting along\n       with an IEP which addresses all of the\n       inadequacies identified in this order or the\n       next annual IEP which appears to be\n       September 2021\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n   The school district did not appeal; but neither did it\ncomply with the order. Specifically, it failed to arrange for\nS.C. to be enrolled at the Latham Center at the school\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                9\n\ndistrict\u2019s expense. Accordingly, K.G., on behalf of S.C.,\nfiled suit in federal court on January 6, 2021, seeking a stay\nput order or preliminary injunction requiring the school\ndistrict to comply with the ALJ order and pay for S.C.\u2019s\nplacement at the Latham Center.\n\nIII.   The District Court\u2019s Denial of a Stay Put Order\n\n    On March 22, 2021, the district court issued an opinion\ndenying a stay put order or preliminary injunction on the\ngrounds that K.G. needed to challenge the September 2020\nIEP in further administrative proceedings. The district court\ndid not analyze how the ALJ order impacted stay put, but\ninstead focused on whether the September 2020 IEP\naddressed the deficiencies described in the ALJ\u2019s decision,\non who should so decide, and on what should happen until\nsuch a decision was made. The district court found that\nbecause the ALJ did not rule on whether the September 2020\nIEP would or would not actually address the deficiencies the\nALJ identified in the earlier IEPs, this question \u201cmust be\nanswered at the administrative level, and not on an expedited\nbasis during an emergency motion for a stay put order before\nthis Court.\u201d In other words, the district court incorrectly read\nthe issue as S.C. rushing to court before exhausting\nadministrative challenges to the September 2020 IEP, rather\nthan analyzing what was an emergency motion before the\ncourt for a stay put order to enforce a favorable ALJ ruling\nthat required S.C.\u2019s placement at the Latham Center pending\nfurther administrative or judicial proceedings. K.G. timely\nappealed.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n    We review a denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse\nof discretion. N.D. v. Haw.

V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT             11\n\nlater by another alternative; and second, it did not engage in\nan analysis of stay put and how the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s\neducational placement.\n\nI. The Proper Interpretation of the ALJ Order\n\n    As noted, the ALJ order reads as follows: \u201cThe [School]\nDistrict is to pay the cost of enrolling the Student at the\nLatham Center, including non-medical care, room and\nboard, for the period commencing on the first day of the\nwinter 2021 semester until the District provides TFS in\nschool-wide setting along with an IEP which addresses all of\nthe inadequacies identified in this order or the next annual\nIEP which appears to be September 2021\u201d (emphasis added).\nFor at least four separate reasons, the ALJ order is properly\ninterpreted as providing a two-phase remedy, with the first\nphase being S.C.\u2019s immediate transfer to the Latham Center\non the first day of the winter 2021 semester, where S.C. is to\nremain, at the school district\u2019s expense, until the ALJ\ndetermines that a new IEP addresses all the perceived\ninadequacies in S.C.\u2019s prior setting.\n\n    First, the plain language of the order\u2014requiring\nplacement at the Latham Center \u201cuntil\u201d the school district\nprovides TFS schoolwide and an appropriate IEP\u2014indicates\na two-phased remedy, rather than two alternative remedies.\nBy using the word \u201cuntil,\u201d as well as contemplating that\nthere would be no further IEP until September 2021\n(although the school district wound up promulgating a new\nIEP in September 2020), the order clearly mandated S.C.\u2019s\nimmediate transfer to the Latham Center at the school\ndistrict\u2019s expense. Conversely, the order nowhere provided\nthat the transfer could be delayed by the school district\u2019s\nexpedient of issuing (prematurely) a new IEP, whose\nadequacy had yet to be addressed by the ALJ (or anyone\nelse).\n\f12      S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n    Second, interpreting the order as somehow providing\nsimultaneous alternative remedies is totally inconsistent\nwith the preceding sixty-nine pages of the ALJ decision,\nwhich explain why immediate placement at the Latham\nCenter is the appropriate step. K.G. had requested either\nplacement at the Latham Center or remedies related to the\nschool district\u2019s providing TFS and adequate IEPs. The ALJ\nordered only placement at the Latham Center and found it\n\u201cunnecessary\u201d to address the remedies related to TFS and\nIEPs in the school district \u201c[b]ecause this order provides for\nthe residential placement requested . . . .\u201d This further\nindicates that this was not an alternative or conditional\nremedy.\n\n     Third, the school district\u2019s argument below and on\nappeal\u2014that the school district could unilaterally nullify the\nfirst part of the ALJ order by developing the September 2020\nIEP\u2014is illogical and contrary to the IDEA\u2019s procedural\nsafeguards. Such an interpretation would effectively\ndelegate the ALJ\u2019s authority to the IEP team, undermining\nthe procedural safeguards outlined in the IDEA for due\nprocess challenges and administrative review. As the\nCircuits that have considered the issue have held, delegating\nthat determination to the IEP team does not comply with the\nIDEA\u2019s statutory scheme. M.S. v. Utah Sch. for the Deaf &\nBlind, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">822 F.3d 1128</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1135 (10th Cir. 2016); Bd. of Educ. of\nFayette Cnty. v.

Cir. 2005). We agree.\n\n   Fourth and finally, considering the ALJ order\nconditional would require K.G. to file a new due process\nchallenge to the September 2020 IEP to receive the benefit\nfrom the favorable ruling in her previous due process\nchallenge, even though the September 2020 IEP was\n\f        S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT               13\n\nnecessarily outside the two-year scope of the initial due\nprocess review, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C). This would\ncreate an impossible scenario for a parent, one that is\ninconsistent with the IDEA\u2019s statutory scheme providing\nspecific procedural safeguards. Such an interpretation would\ntrap parents in a never-ending cycle of due process\nchallenges, forcing them to file a new challenge each time a\nnew IEP is developed, without ever enjoying the benefit of a\nfavorable administrative ruling on a previous due process\nchallenge.\n\n    For the aforementioned reasons, the ALJ order here is\nproperly interpreted as laying out a two-part phased remedy,\nand the district court erred in considering the order as\nproviding for simultaneous alternative remedies, as well as\nin requiring K.G. to file a new administrative challenge to\nthe September 2020 IEP.\n\nII. Stay Put Requires S.C.\u2019s Placement at Latham at\n    LCSD\u2019s Expense\n\n    The district court also erred in failing to analyze stay put\nand how the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s educational\nplacement. As set out in the Department of Education\u2019s\nimplementing regulations, \u201c[i]f the hearing officer in a due\nprocess hearing . . . agrees with the child\u2019s parents that a\nchange of placement is appropriate, that placement must be\ntreated as an agreement between the State and the parents for\npurposes of [stay put].\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518(d).\nFurthermore, as this Court discussed in L.M. v. Capistrano\nUnified School District, \u201c[w]here the agency or the court has\nruled on the appropriateness of the educational placement in\nthe parents\u2019 favor, the school district is responsible for\nappropriate private education costs . . . .\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1466032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1466032/lm-v-capistrano-unified-school-dist/\">556 F.3d 900</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 912\n\f14       S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n(9th Cir. 2009) (discussing other Circuits\u2019 cases holding the\nsame). 2\n\n    The stay put order analysis in this case is thus quite\nstraightforward. The district court simply failed to ask how\nthe ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s educational placement. The\nfinal and unappealed ALJ order, which required the school\ndistrict to pay for S.C. to be placed at the Latham Center on\nthe first day of the winter semester 2021, constituted an\nagreement between the state and S.C.\u2019s parent for purposes\nof the stay put provision. As such, S.C.\u2019s legal placement\nchanged to the Latham Center, either when the ALJ order\nissued on December 22, 2020, or, at worst, on the first day\nof the winter semester 2021. Because the stay put order\nfunctions as an automatic injunction, consideration of\nirreparable harm or other traditional preliminary injunction\nfactors is not necessary.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n\n     As described above, the ALJ order changed S.C.\u2019s\neducational placement to the Latham Center. This Court thus\nreverses and remands with instructions to enter a stay put\norder to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order requiring S.C.\u2019s placement\nat the Latham Center, at the school district\u2019s expense, \u201cuntil\nthe [School] District provides TFS in school-wide setting\nalong with an IEP which addresses all of the inadequacies\n\n\n\n     2\n      While in Capistrano this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial\nof a stay put order on the grounds that there had not yet been an\nadministrative or court decision on the actual merits of the child\u2019s\nplacement, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1466032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1466032/lm-v-capistrano-unified-school-dist/\">556 F.3d at 912</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201313, its reasoning compels the opposite\nconclusion under the facts of this case, as S.C. did, in fact, receive a\nfavorable ALJ ruling on her due process challenge.\n\f         S.C. V. LINCOLN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                      15\n\nidentified in this order . . . .\u201d 3 To be sure, further\nproceedings, whether judicial or administrative, may\nconsider whether the school district is providing TFS\nschoolwide, as well as whether a new IEP (either the\nSeptember 2020 IEP or a subsequent IEP) provides a FAPE\nthat cures the deficiencies in previous IEPs that the ALJ\norder identifies. Unless and until, however, the conclusion\nof such proceedings changes S.C.\u2019s educational placement,\nshe must be placed at the Latham Center and remain there at\nthe school district\u2019s expense.\n\n   REVERSED                AND         REMANDED,                WITH\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      However, to the extent that S.C. asks for placement at the Latham\nCenter for one year as compensatory education, such an order is not\nwarranted under the terms of the ALJ order. The ALJ order found that to\nthe extent that K.G. was still requesting compensatory education, K.G.\n\u201chas not presented sufficient evidence to support the request.\u201d S.C. and\nK.G. cannot argue against the district court\u2019s effective rewriting of the\nALJ order and then ask this Court to rewrite a different part of that ALJ\norder to award a new remedy, one that the ALJ explicitly rejected.\n\f</pre>",

Winters, Chief Assistant\nAttorney General, Jeffrey M. Laurence, Assistant Attorney General, Eric D.\nShare and Karen Z. Bovarnick, Deputy Attorneys General, for Plaintiff and\nRespondent.\n\n\n\n\n*      Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.1110, this opinion is\ncertified for publication with the exception of parts III.A, C, E, and F.\n\f                                       I.\n                               INTRODUCTION\n      During the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial, a jury found Linde Smith\nguilty of second-degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187)1 and found true a deadly\nweapon enhancement allegation (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)).2 Smith\u2019s mother,\nAnne Smith (Anne), was the victim. During the sanity phase of the trial, the\njury found that Smith was legally sane at the time she committed the offense.\nThe trial court sentenced Smith to a term of 16 years to life in prison,\nconsisting of a 15 years to life term for the murder and a one-year consecutive\nterm for the deadly weapon enhancement.\n      On appeal, with respect to the guilt phase, Smith claims that the trial\ncourt erred in excluding certain evidence pertaining to the severity of her\ndepression at the time of the incident giving rise to the charged offense. In\naddition, Smith contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the\njury sua sponte on involuntary manslaughter as an uncharged lesser\nincluded offense to murder. Smith also maintains that the cumulative error\ndoctrine requires reversal of the guilt-phase verdicts.\n      With respect to the sanity phase, Smith claims that the trial court\nviolated her constitutional right to due process under Doyle v. Ohio (1976)\n426 U.S. 610, 618 (Doyle) and its progeny by admitting evidence that she\nclaims amounted to a comment on her exercise of her right to remain silent\npursuant to Miranda v. Arizona (l966) 384 U.S. 436 (Miranda). She also\nmaintains that the trial court erred in refusing to preclude an expert retained\nby the prosecution from testifying due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\n\n\n1     Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent statutory references are to\nthe Penal Code.\n\n2     The jury found Smith not guilty of first-degree murder.\n                                      2\n\fprovide the defense with the expert\u2019s report and related data. Finally, Smith\ncontends that the cumulative error doctrine requires reversal of the sanity\nverdict.\n      In a published portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court\ndid not err in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of\ninvoluntary manslaughter because there is no substantial evidence in the\nrecord to support the giving of the instruction. In another published portion\nof this opinion, we conclude that the trial court did not commit Doyle error.\nWe reject the remainder of Smith\u2019s claims in unpublished portions of this\nopinion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n                                        II.\n                          FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA. Guilt-phase evidence\n      1. Smith\u2019s mental illness\n      Smith suffered from depression for many years. In 1995, Smith began\nto see a psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Brauer, on a somewhat regular basis and\ncontinued to see him until shortly before her commission of the offense.\nDr. Brauer testified that he had diagnosed Smith with both major depressive\ndisorder and dysthymia, with the former being more severe and episodic, and\nthe latter being a milder version of the disorder that was longer lasting.\nDr. Brauer prescribed various psychiatric medications to Smith throughout\nthe time that he treated her. Smith also received care from a different\nphysician, Dr. Schwartley, for a thyroid condition.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      2. Smith\u2019s December 2014 move into Anne\u2019s residence\n      Smith moved into Anne\u2019s residence in December 2014.3 After Smith\nmoved in, Anne became concerned that Smith was sleeping excessively. She\ncalled Dr. Brauer\u2019s office to let him know that Smith was sleeping about\n18 hours per day. Anne was also concerned about the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d that\nSmith owned. Anne\u2019s desire to give away Smith\u2019s clothes was a source of\nconflict between the two.\n      3. The murder\n      On August 12, 2015, during an argument, Smith hit Anne in the head\nrepeatedly with a hammer, killing her.\n      4. Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call4\n      The next afternoon, Smith called 9-1-1 and told the operator that she\nhad killed her mother. Smith told the operator, \u201cWe had a terrible fight, and\nI killed her with a hammer.\u201d After Smith told the operator that the killing\nhad taken place the prior day, the operator asked Smith why she had waited\nso long to call 9-1-1. Smith responded, \u201cI just freaked out, and I was just\ntrying to, I don\u2019t know, I was trying to sleep and pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nWhen asked by the operator what the argument was about, Smith said that\nher mother was \u201cgonna give all my clothes away.\u201d Smith added that she had\n\u201cborrowed a lot of her [mother\u2019s] money,\u201d and also noted that she and her\nmother would both become \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Smith also told the 9-1-1\noperator about her strange sleep patterns, which Smith stated was caused by\nantidepressants that she was taking.\n\n\n3    Smith testified that she had previously lived with Anne for\napproximately 21 days in 2013. According to Smith, she moved out and told\nAnne that she could not live with Anne.\n\n4     The 9-1-1 call was played for the jury during the trial.\n                                       4\n\f      5. The investigation\n      When police arrived, they found Anne\u2019s body in the living room. There\nwas a hammer close to her body. Portions of Anne\u2019s skull were on the\nground, eight to ten feet from her body, and her brain matter was exposed in\nthe areas where the skull was missing. Anne suffered eight lacerations in the\narea above her left ear and behind her forehead, as well as extensive skull\nfractures and injuries to the brain. According to a medical examiner, Anne\u2019s\ncause of death was \u201c[b]lunt force injuries including cranial cerebral injuries\ndue to strikes by [a] hammer.\u201d\n      In addition to fatal head injuries, Anne had a number of defensive\ninjuries consisting of lacerations and contusions on both forearms and on one\nof her hands, as well as fractures to her left wrist and forearm. Smith\nsuffered no physical injuries.\n      Shortly after her arrest, while in a patrol car, Smith told a detective at\nthe scene, \u201cI killed my mom.\u201d\n      6. The defense\n      Smith testified and admitted killing Anne with a hammer. According\nto Smith, on the morning of the killing, she and her mother were packing up\nsome of Smith\u2019s belongings that Anne had insisted Smith donate to charity.\nThis was upsetting to Smith. While they were packing, Anne made several\ndemeaning comments to Smith, and a heated verbal argument ensued.\n      During the argument, Smith picked up a hammer. Anne attempted to\ntake the hammer from Smith and the two began to struggle. Smith hit her\nmother on the head with the hammer four times. Smith testified that she\nthought that the incident was a dream. Smith stated, \u201cAnd I hit her with a\nhammer in the head, and I remember hitting her four times, all in a row, like\nreally fast, and it was like a dream.\u201d\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      After killing her mother, Smith went to bed in the hope that the\n\u201cdream\u201d would end. She called the police the following morning and told the\n9-1-1 operator that she had killed her mother.\n      Dr. Pablo Stewart, a psychiatrist, testified that Smith suffered from\nmajor depressive disorder and hypothyroidism. Dr. Stewart suggested that\nthe evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the killing could have\ncaused Smith to act rashly and out of emotion or passion rather than\njudgment.\nB. Sanity-phase evidence\n      1. The defense\u2019s presentation of evidence of Smith\u2019s insanity\n      The defense presented three mental health experts, each of whom\nopined that Smith was insane at the time of the killing. Two court-appointed\nexperts, Dr. David Berke and Dr. Ashley Cohen, opined that Smith did not\nknow the nature and quality of her acts and she did not appreciate that her\nacts were legally or morally wrong. The third expert, Dr. Stewart,5 testified\nthat, in his opinion, Smith knew the nature and quality of her acts, but did\nnot know that her acts were legally or morally wrong.\n      All three experts diagnosed Smith as suffering major depressive\ndisorder and hypothyroidism. In addition, each of the three experts stated\nthat, in their opinion, Smith had suffered an episode of depersonalization and\nderealization\u2014a mental disorder prompted by stress\u2014at the time of the\nkilling. Dr. Stewart described depersonalization and derealization as \u201csort of\nlooking down at oneself being in some sort of a dream state, not being in full\ncontrol of your body functions and your thought processes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n5      Dr. Stewart was retained by the defense and he testified in both the\nguilt and sanity phases of the trial.\n                                      6\n\f      The doctors each interviewed Smith, and her statements during these\ninterviews formed part of each doctor\u2019s assessment that Smith had suffered a\ndissociative experience at the time of the offense. For example, Dr. Stewart\nstated, \u201cBased on my interview with her, which was confirmed by her\ntestimony where she said she flipped out and that she was in a dream -- felt\nlike she was in a dream, all of that is -- I'm convinced that she was in a period\nof depersonalization at the time of the crime.\u201d Dr. Berke stated that Smith\nhad described herself as being like a passenger in a car and in a dream.\nSimilarly, Dr. Cohen agreed with defense counsel that Smith had described\nher mental state at the time of the offense as \u201calmost being two different\npeople, one, a passenger in a vehicle, and one was driving the vehicle.\u201d\n      2. The People\u2019s presentation of evidence of Smith\u2019s sanity\n      The prosecution presented the testimony of psychologist Dr. Kris\nMohandie. Dr. Mohandie opined that Smith\u2019s claim of being \u201cout of body as if\na passenger . . . in a vehicle,\u201d during the offense was \u201cmalingered,\u201d and\n\u201cmanufactured,\u201d and that Smith\u2019s claim of experiencing that \u201csymptom [was]\nbogus.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\u2019s conclusion was based, in part, on his review of\nSmith\u2019s 9-1-1 call. Specifically, Dr. Mohandie pointed to Smith\u2019s\n\u201cextraordinary sharing of information spontaneously in [the] 9-1-1 call,\u201d and\nthe \u201cemotionality,\u201d that she displayed during the call, both of which\nDr. Mohandie stated, \u201cyou don\u2019t see if a person is out of body, if you will, or\ndistancing themselves from what has happened.\u201d Dr. Mohandie also noted\nthat Smith described the killing during the 9-1-1 call in a manner that\nindicated that she knew that the killing had happened, noting that Smith\nhad said on the 9-1-1- call, \u201c \u2018I tried to pretend that it didn\u2019t happen.\u2019 \u201d\n      In addition, Dr. Mohandie stated that, during his interview of Smith,\nshe used language that was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with an out-of-body\nexperience,\u201d including \u201cus[ing] feeling terms when . . . describ[ing] the\n                                         7\n\fviolence that she inflicted upon her mother.\u201d6 Dr. Mohandie also noted that\nin describing the events surrounding the killing during his interviews with\nher, Smith displayed \u201cno hazing of consciousness,\u201d and that the \u201cgestures\nthat [Smith] ma[de] spontaneously while describing these things, [were] . . .\ninconsistent with some sort of out of body experience.\u201d\n      Another factor that caused Dr. Mohandie to \u201crule[ ] out,\u201d \u201cderealization\nor depersonalization,\u201d was that Smith had not experienced dissociation on a\nrecurrent basis. Dr. Mohandie noted that there was \u201cno evidence of any\ndissociative or depersonalization experiences before or after.\u201d In addition,\nDr. Mohandie noted that episodes of depersonalization and derealization are\nordinarily prompted by \u201can acute stressor,\u201d and observed that \u201c[t]here\u2019s\nnothing about that episode [before the killing] that\u2019s going to cause violence.\u201d\nDr. Mohandie also stated that Smith had engaged in \u201cgoal-directed\u201d behavior\nnear the time of the offense, including retrieving a hammer, that was\ninconsistent with Smith\u2019s claim of having suffered a dissociative experience.\n      Dr. Mohandie supported his opinion that Smith was malingering by\nstating that there was evidence that Smith had engaged in malingering while\nincarcerated after her arrest. Specifically, Dr. Mohandie referred to an\nincident during which \u201c[Smith] exaggerated and made suicidal statements as\na way of trying to get her medications renewed or expedited.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\nalso noted that there was evidence that Smith had reviewed a mental health\nreport while she was undergoing mental health evaluations, which was\n\u201cconcerning,\u201d because it could \u201cpotentially . . . contaminate and educate\n[Smith] further even about how this process works.\u201d Dr. Mohandie did\nacknowledge that Smith had received a score of \u201chonest responding,\u201d on a\n\n\n\n6     During the sanity phase, the People played two video recordings of\nportions of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s interviews of Smith.\n                                      8\n\fpsychological test that he administered to her called the Structured Interview\nof Reported Symptoms (SIRS), which is designed to detecting malingering.7\n      Dr. Mohandie opined that at the time of the murder, Smith knew the\nnature and quality of her actions and knew that her actions were both\nmorally and legally wrong. He believed that Smith was \u201cabsolutely sane.\u201d\n                                       III.\n                                 DISCUSSION\nA. Smith fails to establish any error with respect to either the trial court\u2019s\n   limitation of the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony or the trial court\u2019s\n   exclusion of testimony pertaining to Smith\u2019s journal entries\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in excluding evidence during the\nguilt phase of the trial pertaining to the severity of her depression at the time\nof the incident. Specifically, Smith claims that the trial court erred in\nlimiting the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony concerning her level of\ndepression at the time of the incident and excluding testimony pertaining to\nSmith\u2019s journal entries related to her depression. Smith claims that the\nevidence was relevant to rebut evidence that the People had presented to\nshow that \u201c[her] depression was not severe and [was] improving.\u201d\n      1. The People\u2019s presentation of evidence pertaining to Smith\u2019s\n         statements concerning her level of depression in 2014 and 2015\n\n      Dr. Brauer testified that Smith told him during a July 2014 visit that\nshe was \u201cfeeling better,\u201d and he noted that \u201cshe had low anxiety and mild\ndepression\u201d at that time. Dr. Brauer also stated that he spoke with Smith in\n\n\n7       Dr. Mohandie also administered the Minnesota Multi-Phasic\nPersonality Inventory-II (MMPI-II) psychological test to Smith.\nDr. Mohandie stated that the results of this test showed that there \u201cwas some\ntendency to over-endorse or exaggerate what was going on.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\nalso testified that the MMPI-II was \u201cpicking up depression,\u201d and it \u201cpicked\nup . . . anxiety.\u201d\n                                      9\n\fOctober 2014 and that she \u201cdescribed feeling minimally depressed and\n[having] low-level anxiety.\u201d Dr. Brauer further stated that Smith wrote in\nJanuary 2015 that she was \u201cfeeling better.\u201d Finally, when asked how Smith\nappeared at an April 2015 visit, Dr. Brauer testified:\n          \u201cShe was in pretty good condition. She reported -- in her\n          handwriting again -- \u2018feeling better.\u2019 I judged her stable.\n          She had no complaints. She mentioned that she was living\n          with her mother in Sunnyvale, and my mental status exam,\n          at that point, was unremarkable, you know, she was -- I\n          noted her as being appropriate in appearance, appropriate\n          in behavior, with mild depression and mild anxiety, not\n          tearful, oriented times [three], no side effects, alert, no\n          essential change in her mental status.\u201d\n\n      2. Smith did not preserve her claim that the trial court erroneously\n         limited the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony\n\n             a. Factual and procedural background\n      After the prosecutor called its last witness in the guilt phase, the trial\ncourt held a hearing with counsel outside the presence of the jury. During\nthe hearing, the prosecutor indicated that both parties had \u201csupplemental\n\nmotions,\u201d with respect to Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony.8 The prosecutor indicated\nthat he did not want Dr. Stewart to testify about Smith\u2019s sanity during the\nguilt phase of the trial.\n      In response, defense counsel stated that it was not her intention to\nhave Dr. Stewart testify about \u201canything regarding sanity.\u201d Thereafter, the\ncourt clarified, \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to get into his examination of Ms. Smith,\nright?\u201d\n\n\n8     Although it appears that the People and the defense drafted written\nmotions concerning Dr. Stewart\u2019s prospective testimony, neither party cites\nto such motions in their brief on appeal and no such motions appear in the\nrecord.\n                                      10\n\f      Defense counsel explained that it was her intention \u201cto introduce\ntestimony that [Dr. Stewart] has diagnosed [Smith] with major depressive\ndisorder . . . during his evaluation.\u201d\n      After the court expressed skepticism concerning the relevance of such a\ndiagnosis, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that [Dr. Stewart] can get up\nhere and testify about everything that the defendant told him . . . .\u201d\n      After further discussions among the court, the prosecutor, and defense\ncounsel concerning the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony, the hearing\nconcluded with the following colloquy:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Is the Court concerned that these\n         statements [that Smith made to Dr. Stewart during his\n         interviews with her after her arrest] have not been\n         introduced to the jury during the trial? Is that what the\n         Court is concerned about?\n\n         \u201c[The court:] If that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about -- if you\n         want to say more than the generalized comments,[9] then\n         there is no evidence of that.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] And I don\u2019t know how that comes in.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Unless you call your client.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n\n\n9     Earlier in the hearing, the trial court stated, \u201cI have no problem with\n[Dr. Stewart] reviewing medical records, and saying that, you know, based on\nmy review of the medical records, not based on my discussions with\nMs. Smith, not based on my examination, not based on any tests, not based\non anything that he did after August 13th of 2015[, the day after the murder],\nhe can render his opinions, because I think that\u2019s fair game.\u201d\n                                        11\n\f         \u201c[The court:] But I\u2019m not going to let him come in and say,\n         \u2018Well,\u2019 you know, \u2018I interviewed her in 2016, and she told\n         me this, this, and this, and therefore, I believe that at the\n         time of the incident, she was acting out of a rash impulse\n         and not reason.\u2019\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] I\u2019m not going to allow that, okay? So we can go\n         over it a little more at 1:30 to flesh it out or before the\n         witness testifies so that there\u2019s no question about where you\n         can go and what you can and cannot do with the\n         witness.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. Thank you.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Thank you.\u201d (Italics added.)10\n\n      Smith testified during the defense\u2019s presentation of evidence.\n      The defense did not further discuss the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony\nwith the court prior to Dr. Stewart testifying. During his testimony,\nDr. Stewart stated that he had interviewed Smith on two separate occasions.\nThereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Now I\u2019m going to ask you about your\n         review of these records. After reviewing Dr. Brauer\u2019s\n         records, Dr. Schwartley\u2019s records, your interview with\n         Ms. Linde Smith, interview with the different family\n         members, did you have an opinion as to Ms. Smith\u2019s\n         diagnosis?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] And what was that opinion?\n\n\n\n\n10    The colloquy is taken from page 976 of the reporter\u2019s transcript.\n                                     12\n\f         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] After conducting the review that you just\n         said, it was my opinion that Ms. Smith has suffered from\n         major depressive disorder for an extended period of time.\u201d\n\n            b. Governing law\n      \u201cWhere the court rejects evidence temporarily or withholds a decision\nas to its admissibility, the party desiring to introduce the evidence should\nrenew his offer, or call the court\u2019s attention to the fact that a definite decision\nis desired.\u201d (People v. Holloway (2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 133, internal quotation\nmarks omitted; see, e.g., People v. Smith (2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 632 (Smith)\n[because defendant failed to renew request to admit certain evidence for\nspecific reasons, he \u201cmay not now argue on that basis that its exclusion was\nerror,\u201d citing Evid.

Smith\u2019s claim on appeal\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in prohibiting Dr. Stewart from\ntestifying that Smith was \u201cwas depressed at the time of the incident.\u201d The\n\n\n11    Evidence Code section 354 provides in relevant part:\n         \u201cA verdict or finding shall not be set aside, nor shall the\n         judgment or decision based thereon be reversed, by reason\n         of the erroneous exclusion of evidence unless the court\n         which passes upon the effect of the error or errors is of the\n         opinion that the error or errors complained of resulted in a\n         miscarriage of justice and it appears of record that:\n         \u201c(a) The substance, purpose, and relevance of the excluded\n         evidence was made known to the court by the questions\n         asked, an offer of proof, or by any other means; [or]\n         \u201c(b) The rulings of the court made compliance with\n         subdivision (a) futile[.]\u201d\n                                       13\n\fPeople argue in their respondent\u2019s brief that Smith cannot establish her\nclaimed error because \u201cthe evidence she contends should have been admitted\nwas admitted at trial and before the jury for its consideration.\u201d In response\nto the People\u2019s argument, Smith argues as follows in her reply brief:\n         \u201cDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony that appellant had major\n         depressive disorder for an extended period did not mean\n         she was significantly depressed at the time of the incident.\n         Even if the jury could infer this from his testimony, he\n         provided no facts to explain why he reached an opposite\n         conclusion from her treating psychiatrist. What was\n         missing was that the opinion was based on specific\n         information he obtained from evaluating appellant and that\n         this was why he opined her depression continued to be\n         significant up to the time of the incident. This is what the\n         court excluded. [Citation.][12]\n\n         \u201cAn opinion is only as good as the basis it rests on.\n         [Citation.] A broad statement that Dr. Stewart interviewed\n         appellant did not provide a factual basis for why he opined\n         she was depressed at the time of the incident. Absent the\n         presentation of new information obtained from the\n         interview, the jury was left to conclude his opinion was\n         simply his own interpretation of the same evidence the jury\n         already heard. While this was partly true, Dr. Stewart\u2019s\n         opinion was also based on specific facts obtained from the\n         interview, which the jury was not allowed to hear.\u201d\n\n            d. Application\n      During the trial court\u2019s discussion with the prosecutor and defense\ncounsel, the trial court expressed reservations about permitting Dr. Stewart\nto testify to out-of-court statements that Smith made to Dr. Stewart during\nhis evaluation of her. However, the court made clear that its ruling was\nsubject to further consideration; the court stated, \u201cwe can go over it a little\n\n\n12   This citation is to page 976 of the reporter\u2019s transcript, which we\nquoted in part III.A.2.a, ante. (See fn. 10, ante.)\n                                        14\n\fmore . . . before the witness testifies so that there\u2019s no question about where\nyou can go and what you can and cannot do with the witness.\u201d However,\ndefense counsel never sought further clarification from the trial court as to\nthe permissible scope of her examination of the witness.\n      Further, and critically, at no time during defense counsel\u2019s examination\nof Dr. Stewart did the trial court limit Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony in any fashion.\nSpecifically, at no time during Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony did the trial court\nlimit Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony with respect to specific statements that Smith\nmade to him during his examination of her, and there is no offer of proof or\n\nother record of such excluded statements in the record on appeal.13 To the\nextent that the defense wanted to present, as Smith claims on appeal,\n\u201cspecific information [that Dr. Stewart] obtained from evaluating [Smith],\u201d so\nthat Dr. Stewart could explain \u201cthat this was why he opined [Smith\u2019s]\ndepression continued to be significant up to the time of the incident,\u201d the\ndefense was obligated to \u201crenew [its] request\u201d to admit such evidence for\nthese specific reasons. (Smith, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 632.) The defense\u2019s\nfailure to do so at any time during Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony precludes Smith\nfrom arguing on appeal that the trial court erred in purportedly limiting\nDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony (see ibid.) and precludes this court from reversing on\nthat ground. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.)\n      Accordingly, we conclude that Smith did not adequately preserve her\nclaim that the trial court erroneously limited the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n13    Indeed, Smith fails, even in her brief on appeal, to specify what\n\u201cspecific information,\u201d from Dr. Stewart\u2019s evaluation she was purportedly\nimproperly prevented from presenting at trial.\n                                      15\n\f      3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony\n         pertaining to Smith\u2019s journal entries\n\n            a. Factual and procedural background\n      The defense called City of Sunnyvale Detective Matthew Hutchinson as\na witness. Defense counsel asked Detective Hutchinson whether he had had\nthe opportunity to review \u201csome journal entries that were made by Linde\nSmith in this case.\u201d Detective Hutchinson responded in the affirmative.\nShortly thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Is it true that Ms. Smith had journal\n         entries about feeling depressed?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Objection. Hearsay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Sustained. Can I see counsel in the\n         hallway[?]\u201d\n\n      After the conference in the hallway, defense counsel indicated that she\nhad no further questions.\n      Subsequently, outside the presence of the jury, the following colloquy\noccurred pertaining to the court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, in regards to Officer -- or\n         Detective Hutchinson\u2019s testimony, the Defense sought to\n         elicit testimony from the detective that he reviewed a\n         journal that Ms. Smith had kept. In the journal, she made\n         entries about feeling depressed, unmotivated, experiencing\n         recurring nausea. I believe the Court -- there was an\n         objection as to hearsay, the Defense believed that this was\n         a prior consistent statement to rebut what Dr. Brauer had\n         said regarding the fact that Ms. Smith had indicated her\n         depression was under control.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Do you want to say anything?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Submitted.\n\n\n                                      16\n\f        \u201c[The court:] All right. As I indicated, the questions had to\n        do with the officer talking about entries in the journal that\n        was found in the defendant\u2019s room, I guess. And at one\n        point, when we were in the hallway, defense counsel said\n        that she believed that these statements were prior\n        consistent statements. If so, there was no intervening prior\n        inconsistent statements such that they would become\n        relevant, and to -- and I didn\u2019t think there was an adequate\n        foundation for the fact that the journal was hers that could\n        be laid by that witness, and so I precluded that testimony.\u201d\n\n            b. Governing law and standard of review\n     Evidence Code sections 1236 and 791 pertain to the admissibility of\nprior consistent statements of a witness. Evidence Code section 1236\nprovides:\n        \u201cEvidence of a statement previously made by a witness is\n        not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement\n        is consistent with his testimony at the hearing and is\n        offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section 791.\u201d\n\n     Evidence Code section 791 provides:\n\n        \u201cEvidence of a statement previously made by a witness that\n        is consistent with his testimony at the hearing is\n        inadmissible to support his credibility unless it is offered\n        after:\n\n        \u201c(a) Evidence of a statement made by him that is\n        inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing\n        has been admitted for the purpose of attacking his\n        credibility, and the statement was made before the alleged\n        inconsistent statement; or\n\n        \u201c(b) An express or implied charge has been made that his\n        testimony at the hearing is recently fabricated or is\n        influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the\n        statement was made before the bias, motive for fabrication,\n        or other improper motive is alleged to have arisen.\u201d\n\n\n                                     17\n\f      Evidence Code section 1202 pertains to evidence offered to attack or\nsupport the credibility of a hearsay declarant and provides in relevant part:\n         \u201cEvidence of a statement or other conduct by a declarant\n         that is inconsistent with a statement by such declarant\n         received in evidence as hearsay evidence is not\n         inadmissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of\n         the declarant though he is not given and has not had an\n         opportunity to explain or to deny such inconsistent\n         statement or other conduct. Any other evidence offered to\n         attack or support the credibility of the declarant is\n         admissible if it would have been admissible had the\n         declarant been a witness at the hearing.\u201d\n\n      We review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\n(See, e.g., People v. Guerra (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1067, 1113 [abuse of discretion\nstandard of review applies to any ruling by a trial court on the admissibility\nof evidence].)\n            c. Application\n      On appeal, Smith argues that testimony concerning the journal entries\nwas admissible under Evidence Code section 1202 to impeach Dr. Brauer\u2019s\ntestimony that Smith had \u201creported to him only mild depression and she was\n\nfeeling better.\u201d14 In other words, Smith claims that the evidence was\n\n\n14     In her opening brief, Smith also appears to assert that her journal\nentries were admissible pursuant to Evidence Code sections 791 and 1236 as\nevidence of her prior consistent statements. The journal entries were not\nadmissible pursuant to sections 791 and 1236 because these sections pertain\nto the prior consistent statements of \u201ca witness\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 791, 1236, italics added),\nand at the time Smith sought admission of the statements at trial, she had\nnot yet testified and was therefore not a witness. Smith acknowledges this\nfact in her reply brief, stating:\n         \u201c[Smith] was not called as a witness before Hutchinson\n         testified. At that time, it was her out of court statements\n         that the defense sought to address.\u201d (Italics added.)\n                                       18\n\fadmissible to attack the statements that Dr. Brauer attributed to Smith\npertaining to her mental health during several medical appointments in 2014\nand 2015. (See People v. Baldwin (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 991, 1005 [stating\nthat when a defendant seeks to admit his or her extrajudicial statements\npursuant to Evidence Code section 1202 such statements are \u201cadmissible\nsolely to attack the credibility of the defendant as a declarant in the party\n\nadmissions used against him\u201d (italics omitted)].15 This argument fails\nbecause the only offer of proof as to the content of the journal entries was\ndefense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]n the journal, [Smith] made entries about\nfeeling depressed, unmotivated, experiencing recurring nausea.\u201d Defense\ncounsel did not, however, discuss the time frame to which the journal entries\nreferred. Generic statements that, at some unspecified times, Smith was\nfeeling depressed, did not reasonably impeach evidence of her own\nstatements to Dr. Brauer, made during medical appointments in 2014 and\n2015, that she was \u201c \u2018feeling better.\u2019 \u201d\n      Accordingly, we conclude that Smith has not demonstrated that\ntestimony as to the journal entries was admissible pursuant to Evidence\n\n\n\n\n      Further, when Smith did testify at trial, she did not offer the journal\nentries as prior consistent statements to support her trial testimony. Rather,\nthe only time that Smith sought admission of the journal entries was during\nDetective Smith\u2019s testimony to, as Smith states in her brief, \u201cimpeach [her]\nextrajudicial statements.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to admit evidence of the journal entries pursuant to\nEvidence Code section 1202, for the reasons stated in the text.\n\n15    Smith acknowledges in her brief that her extrajudicial statements to\nDr. Brauer during her medical appointments were \u201cadmissible as statements\nby a party opponent (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220) . . . .\u201d\n                                     19\n\fCode section 1202.16 The trial court thus did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding testimony pertaining to the journal entries.17\nB. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the uncharged\n   lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter because there is no\n   substantial evidence in the record to support the giving of the instruction\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury,\nsua sponte, on involuntary manslaughter as an uncharged lesser included\noffense to the charged offense of murder. Specifically, Smith contends that\nthe jury could have found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter based on\n\nher \u201ceither committing felony assault with a [deadly] weapon[18] or acting\nwith criminal negligence.\u201d\n      1. Standard of review\n      \u201cWe apply the independent or de novo standard of review to the failure\nby the trial court to instruct on an assertedly lesser included offense.\u201d\n(People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1158, 1218 (Cole).) In considering whether\nthe trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on lesser included\n\n\n16    In light of this conclusion, we need not consider the People\u2019s contention\nthat the trial court properly excluded the testimony because the journal\nentries had not been properly authenticated.\n\n17    In light of our conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin excluding the evidence, we further conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling did\nnot violate Smith\u2019s constitutional right to due process as the \u201cerroneous\nexclusion of critical corroborative defense evidence.\u201d (See, e.g., People v.\nRiccardi (2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 809 [\u201cThe routine and proper application of\nstate evidentiary law does not impinge on a defendant\u2019s due process rights\u201d].)\n\n18    Smith refers to the offense as \u201cassault with a weapon\u201d in one portion of\nher brief. However, in the modified CALCRIM No. 580 jury instruction that\nshe claims should have been given, Smith refers to the underlying offense as\nto which she claims an involuntary manslaughter instruction should have\nbeen given as \u201cassault with a deadly weapon.\u201d\n                                       20\n\foffenses, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nappellant. (People v. Turk (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1368.)\n      2. Governing law\n            a. A trial court\u2019s duty to instruct on lesser included offenses\n      \u201cA trial court must instruct the jury sua sponte on a lesser included\noffense only if there is substantial evidence, \u2018 \u201cthat is, evidence that a\nreasonable jury could find persuasive\u201d \u2019 [citation], which, if accepted, \u2018 \u201cwould\nabsolve [the] defendant from guilt of the greater offense\u201d [citation] but not the\nlesser.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Cole, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1218.) In other words,\n\u201c[s]uch instructions are required only where there is \u2018substantial evidence\u2019\nfrom which a rational jury could conclude that the defendant committed the\nlesser offense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense.\u201d (People v.\nDePriest (2007) 42 Cal.4th 1, 50.)\n            b.

Brothers (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 24, 30\u201331 (Brothers), the\ncourt discussed the relationship between murder and manslaughter, both\nvoluntary and involuntary. The court began by outlining the elements of\nmurder, including the element of malice:\n         \u201cMurder is \u2018the unlawful killing of a human being, or a\n         fetus, with malice aforethought.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[M]alice may\n         be express or implied. It is express when there is\n         manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away\n         the life of a fellow creature.\u2019 [Citation.] It is implied when\n         the defendant engages in conduct dangerous to human life,\n         \u2018 \u201cknows that his conduct endangers the life of another\n         and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u201d \u2019\n         [Citation.]\u2019 (Id. at p. 30.)\n\n      The Brothers court explained that \u201cboth voluntary and involuntary\nmanslaughter are lesser included offenses of murder.\u201d (Brothers, supra,\n\n                                        21\n\f236 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.) After describing voluntary manslaughter, the\nBrothers court described involuntary manslaughter as follows:\n         \u201cInvoluntary manslaughter, in contrast, [is the] unlawful\n         killing of a human being without malice. (\u00a7 192.) It is\n         statutorily defined as a killing occurring during the\n         commission of \u2018an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony;\n         or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce\n         death, [accomplished] in an unlawful manner, or without\n         due caution and circumspection.\u2019 (\u00a7 192, subd. (b).)\n         Although the statutory language appears to exclude\n         killings committed in the course of a felony, the Supreme\n         Court has interpreted section 192 broadly to encompass an\n         unintentional killing in the course of a noninherently\n         dangerous felony committed without due caution or\n         circumspection.\u201d (Id. at p. 31.)\n\n      The Brothers court concluded that an instruction on \u201cinvoluntary\nmanslaughter as a lesser included offense must [also] be given when\na rational jury could entertain a reasonable doubt that an unlawful killing\nwas accomplished with implied malice during the course of an inherently\ndangerous assaultive felony.\u201d (Brothers, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 34,\nitalics added.)19\n\n\n\n\n19    The Brothers court reached this conclusion after first explaining that,\nordinarily, \u201cwhen [a] homicide occurs during the commission of an inherently\ndangerous felony, the homicide may be murder under the felony-murder rule,\nirrespective of the presence or absence of malice.\u201d (Brothers, supra,\n236 Cal.App.4th at p. 31, italics added.) However, the Brothers court noted\nthat, under the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d (id. at p. 31, fn. 5), when the underlying\nfelony is an assaultive crime, the assault merges with the homicide, and\napplication of the felony-murder rule is prohibited. (Id. at p. 31.) The\nBrothers court ultimately concluded that \u201can unjustified homicide in the\ncourse of an inherently dangerous assaultive felony (that is, a killing not\namounting to felony murder) and accomplished without malice is . . .\ninvoluntary manslaughter.\u201d (Id. at p. 32.)\n                                       22\n\f                  ii. Mental illness and malice\n      Prior to legislative changes adopted in 1981, a defendant was able to\npresent evidence that she lacked the capacity to form malice. (See People v.\nElmore (2014) 59 Cal.4th 121, 135 [\u201cDiminished capacity was a judicially\ncreated concept,\u201d that \u201callowed defendants to argue that because of mental\ninfirmity, they lacked \u2018awareness of the obligation to act within the general\nbody of laws regulating society,\u2019 and therefore were incapable of acting with\nmalice\u201d]; see id. at p. 138 [\u201cThe 1981 amendments make clear the Legislature\nintended to eliminate the notion of diminished capacity\u201d].)\n      In People v. McGehee (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1208 (McGehee), the\ncourt summarized the current state of the law pertaining to the relevance of\nevidence of a defendant\u2019s mental illness and malice:\n         \u201cWhile diminished capacity no longer mitigates an\n         intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter [citation], a\n         defendant \u2018is still free to show that because of his [or her]\n         mental illness or voluntary intoxication, he [or she] did not\n         in fact form the intent unlawfully to kill (i.e., did not have\n         malice aforethought). [Citation.] In a murder case, if this\n         evidence is believed, the only supportable verdict would be\n         involuntary manslaughter or an acquittal. If such a\n         showing gives rise to a reasonable doubt, the killing\n         (assuming there is no implied malice) can be no greater\n         than involuntary manslaughter.\u2019 ([Citation]; see also \u00a7 28,\n         subd. (a) [\u2018Evidence of mental disease, mental defect, or\n         mental disorder is admissible solely on the issue of whether\n         or not the accused actually formed a required specific\n         intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice\n         aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged\u2019].)\n\n         \u201cThus, in a murder case, instructions on involuntary\n         manslaughter are required where there is substantial\n         evidence that may come in the form of evidence of the\n         defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether\n         or not that defendant actually formed the intent to kill.\u201d\n         (Ibid.)\n\n                                      23\n\f                  iii. Assault with a deadly weapon\n      \u201c[A]ssault with a deadly weapon is a general intent crime; the required\nmens rea is \u2018an intentional act and actual knowledge of those facts sufficient\nto establish that the act by its nature will probably and directly result in the\napplication of physical force against another.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Perez (2018)\n4 Cal.5th 1055, 1066 (Perez).)\n      3. Application\n      As discussed in part III.B.2.a, ante, it is well established under\nCalifornia law that in order for a trial court to have a sua sponte duty to\ninstruct on a lesser included offense, there must be \u201c \u2018evidence from which a\njury composed of reasonable persons could conclude \u201cthat the lesser offense,\nbut not the greater, was committed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Wilson (2021) 11 Cal.5th\n259, 298 (Wilson).) Thus, in order for Smith to prevail on her claim that the\ntrial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on involuntary\nmanslaughter based on her commission of an assault with a deadly weapon,\nthere must be evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Smith\ncommitted an assault-based involuntary manslaughter, but not murder based\non express or implied malice. Our review of the evidence presented during\nthe guilt phase reveals no such evidence.\n      With respect to her commission of the homicide, Smith testified that,\njust before the killing, the victim made several comments that Smith\nconsidered to be demeaning. Smith became emotional and picked up a\nhammer. According to Smith, the victim attempted to take the hammer away\nfrom Smith. After a physical struggle, Smith described the events that\nensued:\n          \u201cAnd I still had the hammer in my hand, and she was to my\n          left, and I was right next to her. And I hit her with a\n          hammer in the head, and I remember hitting her four\n                                       24\n\f         times, all in a row, like really fast, and it was like a dream.\n         And I heard the sound, it was her skull cracking. And then\n         I could feel something that it felt like I hit, like, Jello. And\n         something about that, like, snapped me back into, like,\n         what was going on. And I looked down at my mom, and she\n         was bleeding and her head was -- was wounded, and I\n         suddenly realized that I had done this and I started saying,\n         \u2018Mommy, oh my God, Mommy, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 \u201d\n\n      In light of this testimony, we assume for purposes of this opinion that\nthe jury could have found that Smith was in a dream-like state at the time of\nthe killing and lacked express or implied malice while repeatedly striking the\nvictim in the head with a hammer. However, if the jury so found, the jury\ncould not also have found that Smith, while acting in a dream-like state, had\n\nthe intent to commit an assault with a deadly weapon.20 Specifically, a jury\nthat found that Smith was in a dream-like state and without malice while\nhitting her mother in the head with a hammer could not also have found that,\nat the same time, Smith committed an \u201c \u2018intentional act [with] actual\nknowledge of those facts sufficient to establish that the act by its nature will\nprobably and directly result in the application of physical force against\nanother.\u2019 \u201d (Perez, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 1066, italics added.) That is because\nthere is no evidence in the record from which the jury could reasonably find\nthat Smith, while acting in a dream-like state, was, at the same time, acting\n\n\n\n\n20     In her brief on appeal, Smith asserts, without citation to any evidence\nin the record, that \u201c[w]hile she had the intent to assault, it was not so clear in\nlight of her mental illness, she had malice or the intent to kill.\u201d (Italics\nadded.) As discussed in the text, our review of the record reveals no evidence\nupon which a trier of fact could find that she lacked malice but \u201chad the\nintent to assault.\u201d\n\n                                        25\n\fintentionally.21 Further, because the commission of an assault requires an\nintentional act, a reasonable jury could not find that Smith was in a dream-\nlike state and also find that she was acting in an intentional manner\nsufficient to commit an assault. Because there was no evidence that would\nhave supported a conclusion that Smith committed the lesser offense of an\nassault-based involuntary manslaughter, but not the greater offense of\nmurder, no lesser included offense instruction on involuntary manslaughter\nwas warranted. In short, Smith either committed murder, voluntary\nmanslaughter,22 or no offense at all.\n      We acknowledge that there are broad statements in case law\nsuggesting that, when a defendant is charged with murder, an instruction on\ninvoluntary manslaughter is required whenever the jury could find that the\ndefendant lacked an intent to kill. (See McGehee, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1208 [\u201c[I]n a murder case, instructions on involuntary manslaughter are\nrequired where there is substantial evidence that may come in the form of\nevidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether or\n\n\n21    At oral argument, Smith\u2019s counsel argued that, although Smith knew\nthat she was hitting her mother in the head repeatedly with a hammer and\nthus had the intent to commit an assault, because of her mental illness and\nemotional state, she did not appreciate the dangerousness of such act.\nHowever, we see no evidence in the record, including Smith\u2019s testimony\nrecounted above, from which a reasonable jury could make such a finding.\nStated differently, there is no evidence that any dissociative state under\nwhich Smith was acting at the time of the offense operated in this peculiar\nmanner, i.e., there is no evidence that Smith\u2019s mental state was such that\nthat she maintained an understanding that she was hitting her mother in the\nhead repeatedly with a hammer, but lacked sufficient cognition to \u201c \u2018 \u201cknow[ ]\nthat [her] conduct endanger[ed] the life of another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Brothers, supra,\n236 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.)\n\n22    The trial court instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter based on\nheat of passion.\n                                       26\n\fnot that defendant actually formed the intent to kill\u201d]; People v. Rogers (2006)\n39 Cal.4th 826, 884 (Rogers) [\u201cAn instruction on involuntary manslaughter is\nrequired whenever there is substantial evidence indicating the defendant did\n\nnot actually form the intent to kill\u201d].)23 However, we understand the law to\nbe that, in order for a trial court to have a sua sponte duty to instruct on\ninvoluntary manslaughter, there must be substantial evidence from which\nthe jury could find that the defendant lacked express or implied malice, but\ncommitted the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. (People v.\nAbilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 515 [\u201c \u2018If the evidence presents a material issue\nof whether a killing was committed without malice, and if there is substantial\nevidence the defendant committed involuntary manslaughter, failing to\ninstruct on involuntary manslaughter would violate the defendant\u2019s\nconstitutional right to have the jury determine every material issue\u2019 \u201d].) To\nconclude that an involuntary manslaughter instruction is required in every\ncase in which a jury could find that a defendant committed a killing but\nlacked malice would do away with the bedrock principle that an uncharged\nlesser included offense instruction is required only if there is substantial\nevidence upon which a jury could find both that the defendant did not commit\nthe greater offense, but did commit the lesser. (See, e.g., Wilson, supra,\n11 Cal.5th at p. 298.) We aware of no authority that would support such a\nconclusion and decline to reach it here.\n\n\n\n\n23    The formulations in McGehee and Rogers also should not be read to\nsuggest that murder requires proof an \u201cintent to kill,\u201d (McGehee, supra,\n246 Cal.App.4th 1208; Rogers, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 884), since implied\nmalice murder does not require proof of such intent. (See, e.g., People v.\nFontenot (2019) 8 Cal.5th 57, 80 [\u201cmurder . . . requires an act causing the\ndeath of another, but not the intent to kill, as implied malice will suffice\u201d];\nPeople v. Gonzalez (2012) 54 Cal.4th 643, 653 [same].)\n                                       27\n\f      We also are not persuaded by Smith\u2019s contention that there was\nsubstantial evidence supporting an involuntary manslaughter instruction\nbased on her having acted with criminal negligence. (Citing People v. Glenn\n(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1461.) In Glenn, the Court of Appeal concluded that\nan involuntary manslaughter instruction was required because \u201c[p]art of [the\ndefendant\u2019s] testimony suggests the stabbing [that resulted in a homicide]\nwas accidental.\u201d (Id. at p. 1465.) The testimony from which the Court of\nAppeal reached this conclusion was the following:\n         \u201cGlenn [the defendant] testified he removed the knife from\n         his waistband and placed it in his lap while he sat at the\n         counter. When he got up from the counter and started\n         walking toward the door he tried, at the same time, to put\n         the knife back in his pants. As he was walking and trying\n         to slip the foot-long knife back into his pants he heard the\n         victim coming up behind him. The victim appeared about\n         to grab Glenn and, in a reflex action, Glenn turned with the\n         knife in his hand and the knife entered the victim\u2019s chest\n         causing a fatal wound. Glenn stated, \u2018I didn\u2019t try to stick it.\n         It\u2019s just that when he turned--when I turned and he is\n         coming, and it just happened like at the same time.\u2019 \u201d (Id.\n         at pp. 1465\u20131466.)\n\n      There was no comparable evidence in this case from which a jury could\nhave reasonably found that Smith\u2019s acts in striking the victim in the head\nrepeatedly with a hammer was accidental.\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to\ninstruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter,\nbecause there is no substantial evidence to support the giving of the\n\ninstruction.24\n\n\n\n24    In the alternative, Smith argues that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance in failing to request an instruction on involuntary\nmanslaughter. Given our conclusion that there is no substantial evidence to\n                                        28\n\fC. Smith is not entitled to reversal of the guilt phase verdict pursuant to the\n   cumulative error doctrine\n\n      Smith contends that the cumulative effect of the errors that she alleges\noccurred during the guilt phase requires reversal of the guilt-phase verdict.\n\u201cUnder the \u2018cumulative error\u2019 doctrine, errors that are individually harmless\nmay nevertheless have a cumulative effect that is prejudicial.\u201d (In re Avena\n(1996) 12 Cal.4th 694, 772, fn. 32.) We have found no errors to cumulate.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the cumulative error doctrine does not require\nreversal of the guilt-phase verdict.\nD. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence during the sanity\n   phase of the trial that Smith had not described being in a state of\n   depersonalization or derealization prior to her evaluation with\n   Dr. Stewart\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in admitting evidence during\nthe sanity phase that Smith had not described being in a state of\ndepersonalization or derealization prior to her evaluation with Dr. Stewart.\nShe contends that the evidence was inadmissible as violative of her\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle, supra, 426 U.S. 610 and its\nprogeny because it amounted to a comment on her exercise of her right to\nremain silent after having been advised of her rights under Miranda, supra,\n384 U.S. 436.\n\n\n\n\nsupport the giving of an involuntary manslaughter instruction, we reject\nSmith\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. (See People v. Szadziewicz (2008)\n161 Cal.App.4th 823, 836 [\u201cDefense counsel\u2019s failure to request instructions\non unreasonable self-defense and lesser included offenses based on that\ntheory did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d because\ninstructions were not supported by the evidence or the law and \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s\nfailure to make a futile or unmeritorious motion or request is not ineffective\nassistance\u201d (italics omitted)].)\n                                       29\n\f      We assume for purposes of this decision that the de novo standard of\nreview applies in determining whether the trial court violated Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle. (See People v. Seijas (2005)\n36 Cal.4th 291, 304 [\u201cindependent review \u2018comports with this court\u2019s usual\npractice for review of mixed question determinations affecting constitutional\n\nrights\u2019 \u201d].)25\n      1. Factual and procedural background\n             a. Pretrial and guilt phase background\n      Prior to the trial, in a motion in limine, the People stated that they\nintended to offer in evidence Smith\u2019s statements to the 9-1-1 operator and to\na police officer immediately after her arrest. However, the People indicated\nthat they did not intend to introduce in evidence during their case in chief\n\n\n\n25     Smith also contends that \u201c[a]t the very least, the evidence should have\nbeen excluded under Evidence Code section 352.\u201d She also appears to\ncontend that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence because it was\nirrelevant. Smith did not assert Evidence Code section 352 or relevancy\nobjections in the trial court and as a result, her appellate claims on these\ngrounds are forfeited. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 353 [providing in part that a\n\u201cverdict or finding shall not be set aside, nor shall the judgment or decision\nbased thereon be reversed, by reason of the erroneous admission of evidence\nunless: [\u00b6] (a) There appears of record an objection to or a motion to exclude\nor to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make clear\nthe specific ground of the objection or motion\u201d].)\n       Smith also broadly asserts that trial counsel was \u201cineffective to the\nextent she failed to make a proper objection or motion,\u201d (capitalization\nomitted) but fails to present any argument that trial counsel\u2019s failure to make\nan Evidence Code section 352 or relevancy objection amounted to ineffective\nassistance. Accordingly, this line of argument is forfeited as well. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Harper (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1419, fn. 4 [\u201can argument\nraised in . . . perfunctory fashion is waived\u201d].) Accordingly, we address in the\ntext the claim that Smith properly preserved in the trial court and on appeal,\ni.e., her claim of Doyle error.\n\n                                       30\n\fSmith\u2019s interview at the police station shortly after she was arrested because\nthe interview contained statements that Smith made after invoking her right\nto counsel.\n\n      During the guilt phase of the trial,26 the People introduced in evidence\na recording of Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call and statements that she made to a police\nofficer in a patrol car immediately after her arrest.\n              b. Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony on direct examination during the\n                 sanity phase\n\n      During direct examination in the sanity phase of the trial, Dr. Stewart\ndescribed to the jury the documents that he reviewed in preparing for his\npsychiatric evaluation of Smith:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. Now, in this case, you were hired\n         to conduct the psychiatric evaluation of Ms. Smith. What\n         documents did you review in preparation for that\n         evaluation?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Police reports, medical records, including\n         the 20-plus years that she was in treatment with\n         Dr. Brauer, the Santa Clara County Jail medical and\n         psychiatric records.\u201d\n\n      Dr Stewart also extensively discussed Smith\u2019s jail records, which\ndocumented that Smith had been placed on a psychiatric hold while in jail\nawaiting trial.\n      Dr. Stewart also testified, \u201cI\u2019m convinced that [Smith] was in a period\nof depersonalization at the time of the crime.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n26   The parties stipulated that the jury could consider all evidence offered\nduring the guilt phase in the sanity phase.\n                                      31\n\f            c. The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart and the\n               defense\u2019s Doyle objection\n\n      The prosecutor asked Dr. Stewart whether he had asked Smith \u201cabout\ndeliberation,\u201d and what Smith had said in response. Dr. Stewart responded:\n         \u201cI asked her if she had planned to kill her mother and she\n         said no, she was in this dream-like state where she didn\u2019t\n         have control over her mental processes or control of her\n         body, and had a hammer in her hand and then she was in\n         this state, observing herself hitting her mother and that\n         during the course of the hitting, she -- as she has testified\n         to and as she told me, she said she snapped out of it when\n         she felt the hammer going into her mother\u2019s head. That\u2019s\n         what she said.\u201d\n\n      Shortly thereafter, the following colloquy occurred during which the\ntrial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s Doyle objections:\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] All right. Now, you talked to [Smith] in\n         May of 2017; is that correct, thereabouts?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] September of \u201916.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. But your report was May of 2017?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Correct.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. So you talked to her in\n         September?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] And January of \u201917.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] January of \u201917. Okay. Was that the first\n         time, to your knowledge, that [Smith] mentioned this idea\n         of depersonalization and derealization?\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection, Your Honor. Doyle error.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Overruled.\n\n\n                                       32\n\f         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] She never mentioned depersonalization or\n         derealization.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] She didn\u2019t use those words because that\u2019s\n         not in her vocabulary, but was that the first time, to your\n         knowledge -- and granted, this jury already knows that you\n         reviewed all the jail records and you reviewed all the police\n         records and so you reviewed all the statements of everyone\n         concerned, okay -- was that the first time that she\n         mentioned, when you met with her, this idea of being\n         outside of herself or being in a car or not acting within\n         herself?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Same objection, Your Honor.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Overruled.\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] In my review of the police records, I don\u2019t\n         remember her describing that exact -- using those exact\n         terms of being in a dream state. I believe she said she got\n         in an argument with her mother and ended up hitting her\n         with a hammer. But to answer your question, I\u2019m unaware\n         of if [or] when she told me that, that that was the first time.\n         She may have said it to someone else that I\u2019m not aware\n         of.\u201d\n\n      Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor asked Dr. Stewart whether\nSmith had suggested having been in a state of derealization at the time of the\noffense during either the 9-1-1 call or during her conversation with a\ndetective immediately after her arrest:\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] All right. You heard the 9-1-1 call in this\n         case --\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] -- as part of the materials that were\n         provided to you?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n                                       33\n\f\u201c[The prosecutor:] She doesn\u2019t mention in that call any sort\nof comments that would lead you to believe that she was in\na state of derealization; right?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] In the call, no.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. And you\u2019ve heard also the patrol -\n- we\u2019re calling it an interview, but there\u2019s a colloquy\nbetween her and one of the detectives in the patrol car\nimmediately after the arrest. Do you know what I\u2019m\ntalking about?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] I believe she voluntary says something\nabout killing her mother.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] They said, \u2018It\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 and she\nsaid, \u2018It\u2019s not okay. I killed my mother.\u2019 Do you remember\nthat?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] And there\u2019s no mention there of any sort\nof being outside of a body or anything of that sort; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Correct.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] You would agree that those statements\ncame much closer in time to the murder than your\nconversation with her; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Absolutely.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] So at the time, the events would have\nbeen fresh in her mind; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Well, it certainly was closer in time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f            d. The discussion of Smith\u2019s Doyle objection among the court and\n               counsel outside the presence of the jury\n\n      During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart, the trial\ncourt excused the jury for a recess. During the recess, the following\ndiscussion of Smith\u2019s Doyle objection occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] I do want to put my objection on the\n         record in regards to questioning of Dr. Stewart about the\n         fact that the first time my client made statements\n         regarding the offense, that went to depersonalization and\n         derealization was when Dr. Stewart talked to her, I believe.\n         It\u2019s an error on the prosecution\u2019s part to ask questions\n         regarding her assertion of her Fifth Amendment right to\n         remain silent and not talk to the police at the time of the\n         incident, and so asking questions that are posed in that\n         manner opens the door now to, unfortunately, the Defense\n         might having to go into that area.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Your Honor, I do not specifically recall --\n         I don\u2019t believe there is a mention in that -- and I know that\n         Counsel\u2019s referring to the questioning of the defendant by\n         Detective [DiGiovanna], in which she invoked and which\n         the People agreed we were not going to use. I don\u2019t believe\n         that she says anything about depersonalization or\n         derealization in that conversation. But in any event, I\n         certainly was not referring to that at all. I was specifically\n         referring to the statements that had been admitted here in\n         court which include the 9-1-1 call and the patrol [car]\n         questioning, as well as the defendant\u2019s own testimony. I\n         was not making any reference at all to that particular piece\n         of evidence.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, I think posing questions\n         such as, \u2018This is the first time that Ms. Smith made\n         statements to you in regards to being in a dream-like state,\u2019\n         you know, \u2018not having control of her mental processes,\u2019 that\n         line of questioning, I think, is improper, given the fact that\n         she invoked with the police. I think if those questions were\n                                      35\n\f-- if she was interviewed by the police and those questions\nwere posed of her and she hadn\u2019t invoked then, she might\nhave made those statements. But the fact that she\ninvoked --\n\n\u201c[The court:] No. I understand your objection. [Dr. Stewart]\nsaid that he looked at the police reports. Did the police\nreports contain the statement that is not -- that the People\nhave indicated they\u2019re not using, the one that was made\nwhere she did invoke?\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] Yes. There is, I think, a summary by\nDetective [DiGiovanna] in there.\n\n\u201c[The court:] Okay. So [Dr. Stewart] looked in there. And\nmy recollection is that he didn\u2019t see any mention of these\nstatements in the police reports or in the 9-1-1 call or her\ntestimony, or -- but he specifically said he did not -- he says,\n\u2018I don\u2019t remember them in these other things, but I don\u2019t\nknow whether or not she has ever made those statements\nbefore.\u2019\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, I think making any\ncomment on a person\u2019s invocation of their Fifth\nAmendment right, the fact that she previously didn\u2019t make\na statement when they have invoked, is error. Whether\nthey made any kind of statement during that limited\ninterview by Detective [DiGiovanna], just the reference to\nit, I believe, is error, and that was the basis for both my\nobjections during the time of questioning.\n\n\u201c[The court:] And I overruled it.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Yes.\n\n\u201c[The court:] Okay. I still think they should be overruled.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\f             e. Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony\n      Dr. Mohandie testified that the first time Smith described being in a\nstate of depersonalization or derealization was several months after the\n\noffense.27\n      During defense counsel\u2019s cross examination of Dr. Mohandie, the\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Do you have any evidence in the\n         discovery that you\u2019ve received indicating that [Smith]\n         checked out some books on mental disorders, specifically\n         depersonalization or derealization or any other mental\n         disorders?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] I don\u2019t know anything about that, no.\n\n\n27    Although not material to Smith\u2019s claim, there is some ambiguity in the\nrecord as to the amount of time that Dr. Mohandie stated had passed from\nthe commission of the offense to Smith\u2019s first disclosure of dissociation.\nDuring direct examination, the prosecutor asked Dr. Mohandie to discuss\ninconsistencies between \u201cinformation that you learned versus the\ninvestigative documents . . . .\u201d Dr. Mohandie responded:\n         \u201cRight. Well, basically, the 9-1-1 call in particular, there\u2019s\n         a very clear discussion, in my opinion, of a statement, if you\n         will, by Ms. Smith about what happened. There was no\n         evidence whatsoever of any kind of dissociative experience\n         or depersonalization, which is what she\u2019s going to say later,\n         the first time nearly three months later, and certainly in the\n         interview with me on May 2nd of this year; so that\u2019s a very\n         significant inconsistency, that particular fact.\n         \u201cAnd there\u2019s no behavioral evidence of it during that 9-1-1\n         call, no references to anything that would be like that;\n         rather, it was quite the opposite, sort of lucid, it was very\n         present, it was very emotion-laden, which is not what you\n         would see.\u201d (Italics added.)\n       However, on cross-examination, Dr. Mohandie indicated that Smith\u2019s\nfirst disclosure had occurred a \u201cyear and three months,\u201d after the offense.\n(Italics added.)\n                                       37\n\f\u201c[Defense counsel:] So you don\u2019t have any basis for your\nclaim that you think she made this up afterwards?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] Well, the basis is -- I do have a basis. The\nbasis is that she\u2019s reporting a disorder that is not\nrealistically being reported in terms of how these things\nhappen, that is inconsistent with the behavioral and\nemotional evidence, as I see it, and that there was no\ncontemporaneous -- that is at the time or around the time --\nevidence of it, and it doesn\u2019t appear until the year and\nthree months later. That is the basis of my finding.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] And you\u2019re aware that that\u2019s the first\ntime that she speaks to a psychiatrist; is that correct, about\nher case?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] It may be.\n\n\u201c[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. And when she\u2019s arrested and she\nis charged with a crime and provided an attorney, at that\npoint, she\u2019s not allowed to be interviewed, is that fair to\nsay, without the consent of her attorney?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] You mean after she invoked?\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] If an individual is arrested, charged\nwith a crime, and given an attorney, no one is allowed to\ninterview her at that point; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] True.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] And so between that time and the time\nthat Dr. Stewart met with her, there was no opportunity for\nher to provide a statement to anyone except her attorney; is\nthat correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] In terms of an official statement, sure.\nAgreed.\u201d\n\n                              38\n\f            f. Smith\u2019s request for a pinpoint instruction and motion for a\n               mistrial\n\n      During a hearing outside the presence of the jury the following day, the\ntrial court indicated that defense counsel had stated in chambers that she\nbelieved that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith having invoked her right to\ncounsel was a violation of a court order because, just prior to having made\nthat statement, Dr. Mohandie had been admonished by counsel outside the\npresence of the jury not to refer to Smith\u2019s statements to the police after she\n\nhad invoked her right to counsel.28 Defense counsel stated the following:\n         \u201cI\u2019m asking the Court specifically for a pinpoint instruction\n         indicating that the witness for the prosecution intentionally\n         violated instructions from the judge. I didn\u2019t indicate \u2018court\n         order,\u2019 and that was the instructions you gave us in the\n         hallway to go outside, talk to him, let him know not to\n\n28    Specifically, the trial court stated that defense counsel believed that\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith\u2019s invocation violated a court order as\nfollows:\n         \u201cYou believe that that was a violation of a court order\n         because prior to that time, we had a discussion in the\n         hallway where we reaffirmed that the statements that\n         Ms. Smith made to police officers at the police station, not\n         the one that was referred to in the car at the scene, but\n         those statements were potentially a violation of Miranda.\n         We didn\u2019t really necessarily get to that because both\n         counsel agreed that the [prosecutor] agreed he was not\n         going to try and introduce that. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] So I don\u2019t know\n         that there was a specific ruling on it, but I\u2019m satisfied that\n         both the parties believe that it was a violation of Miranda.\n         And we reaffirmed in the hallway that he would not refer to\n         that, and then I came out, told [Dr. Mohandie] to go out\n         into the hallway with counsel, and I wasn\u2019t present, but\n         apparently that was told to [Dr. Mohandie], and then he\n         came back and it was after that that [Dr. Mohandie] made\n         this statement,\u201d about Smith invoking.\n                                       39\n\f         discuss anything in regards to the statements that\n         Ms. Smith made to the police because it was a violation of\n         her right when she invoked.\n\n         \u201cI also asked the Court to -- well, let me read the statement\n         in its entirety. \u2018The witness for the prosecution\n         intentionally violated instructions from the judge. You can\n         consider that fact when evaluating what weight to give to\n         this witness\u2019s credibility and testimony in this case. And,\n         furthermore, you should not consider any evidence\n         regarding Linde Smith\u2019s timing of her disclosures of\n         depersonalization and derealization episode.\u2019\n\n         \u201cAnd in regards to the last point, Your Honor, we\u2019ve had\n         multiple conversations regarding statements that have\n         been made -- or questions that have been asked in cross-\n         examination of my witnesses as well as statements made\n         by the prosecution witness that her -- Linde Smith\u2019s\n         reported symptoms regarding depersonalization and\n         derealization were actually a year and three months later,\n         and therefore, they\u2019re suspect. I believe, as I had\n         previously indicated to the Court, that that was a Doyle\n         error, and it is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n         due process rights of my client, as well as the Doyle case,\n         426 U.S. 610.\n\n         \u201cI am requesting that the Court consider a mistrial, given\n         the fact that Dr. Mohandie made a statement regarding\n         invocation, and made several statements regarding the fact\n         that Linde Smith disclosed the statement a year and three\n         months later when she had, in fact, invoked her right to\n         remain silent.\u201d\n\n      The prosecutor objected to the giving of the instruction and argued that\nthere had been no Doyle violation. After further discussion from the\nprosecutor and the defense, the trial court ruled as follows:\n         \u201cAll right. Couple things. No. 1, with regard to the request\n         for a pinpoint instruction, and that instruction which is\n         Court Exhibit 1, I denied it as written, and for [a] number\n         of reasons, one of which being that I do not believe that I\n                                       40\n\f         have sufficient proof that the witness intentionally violated\n         an instruction from the judge.\n\n         \u201cAlso, the instruction says that you should not consider any\n         evidence regarding Linde Smith\u2019s timing of her disclosures\n         of depersonalization and derealization episode as part of\n         that instruction, and I think that\u2019s contrary to the evidence\n         and goes far beyond what he said.\n\n         \u201cI did propose that I would read the following, quote, \u2018When\n         Dr. Mohandie, in response to a question by defense counsel,\n         asked, quote, \u201cyou mean after she invoked,\u201d end quote, that\n         comment was an improper reference to the defendant\u2019s\n         actions and contrary to an agreement by the parties after a\n         discussion with the Court. You may not consider, for any\n         purpose, whether the defendant invoked any right, and you\n         may not consider the doctor\u2019s comment for any reason.\u2019\n\n         \u201cCounsel opted not to allow that -- or not to have that read\n         to the jury.\u201d\n\n      Defense counsel responded that the reason she had rejected the trial\ncourt\u2019s offer to provide its proposed instruction was that the court\u2019s proposed\ninstruction highlighted the issue of invocation, while the defense\u2019s proposed\ninstruction was \u201cmore vague.\u201d\n      The court interjected:\n         \u201cThat\u2019s fine. That was another reason for denying the\n         pinpoint instruction[,] the fact that it has no context. It\n         simply says, \u2018The witness for the prosecution intentionally\n         violated instructions from the judge.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t tell the jury\n         what particular instructions of the Court were violated, and\n         I think that is misleading as well.\u201d\n\n      The court also denied the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial.\n            g. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\n      During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor argued that it\nwas important for the jury to view Smith\u2019s interview with Dr. Mohandie in\n\n                                       41\n\fpart because \u201cit shows [the jury] the progression of her made-up story, okay?\u201d\nThe prosecutor continued:\n         \u201cWhen [Smith] first tells 9-1-1 what happened, she hasn\u2019t\n         yet thought of this idea of being outside a car and not being\n         in her own body, okay? She only adds that later when she\n         meets Dr. Stewart, okay?\n\n         \u201cBy the time the defendant got to court here and testified\n         before you, the day that she was examined and was cross-\n         examined by me, the story was complete. All the parts\n         were there.\u201d\n\n      2. Governing law\n       In Doyle, supra, 426 U.S. 610, the United States Supreme Court held\nthat \u201cthe use against defendant of a postarrest invocation of rights following\na Miranda admonition violates due process.\u201d (People v. Thomas (2012)\n54 Cal.4th 908, 936, citing Doyle, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 619.) The Doyle court\nreasoned, \u201c[W]hile it is true that the Miranda warnings contain no express\nassurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any\nperson who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be\nfundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested\nperson\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at\ntrial.\u201d (Doyle, supra, at p. 618.)\n      In Wainwright v. Greenfield (1986) 474 U.S. 284, the United States\nSupreme Court extended Doyle and held that the prosecution\u2019s use of the\ndefendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence to demonstrate a defendant\u2019s sanity is\nimproper. (Id. at p. 292.) In Wainwright, two police officers testified that\nshortly after his arrest, the defendant had twice exercised his right to remain\nsilent and his desire to consult with counsel before answering any questions.\n(Id. at pp. 286\u2013287.) During closing argument, \u201cthe prosecutor reviewed the\ntestimony of [the officers] and suggested that [defendant\u2019s] repeated refusals\n\n                                      42\n\fto answer questions without first consulting an attorney demonstrated a\ndegree of comprehension that was inconsistent with his claim of insanity.\u201d\n(Id at p. 287.) The Wainwright court held that this testimony and argument\nwas improper under Doyle, reasoning:\n         \u201cThe point of the Doyle holding is that it is fundamentally\n         unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will\n         not be used against him and thereafter to breach that\n         promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.\n         It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence\n         to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity.\u201d (Wainwright,\n         supra, at p. 292.)\n\n      \u201cBut this does not mean that it always is error to permit evidence that\na defendant exercised his right to counsel.\u201d (People v. Huggins (2006)\n38 Cal.4th 175, 198.) \u201cTo establish a violation of due process under Doyle, the\ndefendant must show that the prosecution inappropriately used his\npostarrest silence for impeachment purposes and the trial court permitted\nthe prosecution to engage in such inquiry or argument. [Citations.] . . . An\nassessment of whether the prosecutor made inappropriate use of defendant\u2019s\npostarrest silence requires consideration of the context of the prosecutor\u2019s\ninquiry or argument. [Citation.] A violation of due process does not occur\nwhere the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s postarrest silence constitutes\na fair response to defendant\u2019s claim or a fair comment on the evidence.\n[Citations.] \u2018 . . . Doyle\u2019s protection of the right to remain silent is a \u201cshield,\u201d\nnot a \u201csword\u201d that can be used to \u201ccut off the prosecution\u2019s \u2018fair response\u2019 to\nthe evidence or argument of the defendant.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d (People v.\nChampion (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1448 (Champion).)\n      In addition, a prosecutor does not violate Doyle by inquiring about prior\nvoluntary statements that a defendant has made. (Anderson v. Charles\n(1980) 447 U.S. 404, 409 (Anderson) [where \u201cquestions were not designed to\n\n                                         43\n\fdraw meaning from silence, but to elicit an explanation for a prior\ninconsistent statement,\u201d Doyle is not violated].) As the Anderson court\nexplained:\n         \u201cDoyle bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence\n         maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. But\n         Doyle does not apply to cross-examination that merely\n         inquires into prior inconsistent statements. . . . As to the\n         subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not\n         remained silent at all.\u201d (Anderson, supra, at p. 408.)\n\n      3. Application\n      Smith argues, \u201cIn violation of Doyle, the prosecution\u2019s questions and\nthe resulting testimony, as well as Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony, suggested that\n[Smith\u2019s] claim of depersonalization or derealization was fabricated because\nshe did not mention it after invoking her right to silence under the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments,\u201d until speaking with mental health experts more\nthan a year after the offense. We are not persuaded.\n      We first consider the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart.\nDr. Stewart testified on direct examination that he relied on \u201c[p]olice\nreports . . . [and] the Santa Clara County Jail medical and psychiatric\nrecords,\u201d in conducting his psychiatric evaluation of Smith. Dr. Stewart also\ntestified at length about the content of Smith\u2019s jail psychiatric records. Given\nDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony that he relied on \u201cpolice reports,\u201d and \u201cjail records,\u201d it\nwas not Doyle error for the prosecutor to ask Dr. Stewart whether there were\nany statements in the \u201cjail records\u201d and \u201cpolice reports\u201d indicating that Smith\nhad referenced \u201cthis idea of being outside of herself or being in a car or not\nacting within herself.\u201d Doyle is based on the idea that it is \u201cfundamentally\nunfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence\nto be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d (Doyle,\nsupra, 426 U.S. at p. 618.) However, the fundamental fairness concerns\n\n                                       44\n\fanimating Doyle and its progeny do not prohibit a prosecutor from cross-\nexamining a defense expert about whether there are statements to support\nhis opinion in the documents on which the defense expert has expressly\nstated that he relied. To conclude otherwise would be to allow the defendant\nto use \u201c \u2018the right to remain silent . . . [as] a \u201csword\u201d . . . to \u201ccut off the\nprosecution\u2019s \u2018fair response\u2019 to the evidence or argument of the defendant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Champion, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1448.) Doyle is not to be applied in\nsuch an instance.\n      This is particularly so given that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not\nmake any specific reference to the police interview during which Smith\n\napparently invoked her right to remain silent.29 Instead, and in considering\nthe \u201ccontext of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry\u201d (Champion, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1448), we note that the specific statements of Smith that the prosecutor\ndid reference were Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call and her conversation with a detective\nimmediately after her arrest. The prosecutor did not violate Doyle by asking\nDr. Stewart whether Smith had mentioned depersonalization when making\nthese statements. (See Anderson, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 408 [\u201cDoyle does not\napply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent\nstatements\u201d].)\n      Similarly, the gist of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s\nclosing argument that Smith references on appeal was that Smith\u2019s claim of\ndepersonalization lacked believability because her claim was inconsistent\nwith voluntary statements that she made near the time of the offense. (See\npt. III.D.1.e. and pt. III.D.1.g, ante.) For example, Dr. Mohandie noted that\nthere was \u201cno evidence whatsoever of any kind of dissociative experience or\ndepersonalization,\u201d in Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call. Similarly, during his closing\n\n\n29    A transcript of the interview is not in the record.\n                                       45\n\fargument, the prosecutor argued that when Smith \u201cfirst tells 9-1-1 what\nhappened, she hasn\u2019t yet thought of this idea of being outside a car and not\nbeing in her own body,\u201d and that Smith \u201conly adds that later when she meets\nDr. Stewart . . . .\u201d Arguing such inconsistencies does not constitute Doyle\nerror. (See Anderson, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 408.) Further, neither\nDr. Mohandie nor the prosecutor ever stated or suggested that Smith\u2019s\ntestimony was unbelievable because she had invoked her right to remain\nsilent during a police interview.\n      In addition, Dr. Mohandie\u2019s mention of Smith\u2019s invocation of her\nMiranda rights during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination did not constitute\nDoyle error or warrant the granting of a mistrial. While defense counsel\nargued that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s reference constituted an intentional violation of\nthe trial court\u2019s instructions, the record does not contain the precise\nadmonishment that Dr. Mohandie received prior to providing this testimony.\n(See fn. 28, ante.) Further, the trial court could have reasonably found that\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith\u2019s invocation reflected a good faith attempt\n\nto answer defense counsel\u2019s question.30 In sum, the trial court reasonably\ndetermined that it lacked \u201csufficient proof that the witness intentionally\nviolated an instruction from the judge.\u201d Further, the trial court\u2019s offer to\nprovide an admonishment to the jury was a reasonable approach to cure any\npotential prejudice from Dr. Mohandie\u2019s statement. And, while defense\n\n\n30    As noted in part III.D.1.e, ante, Dr. Mohandie referenced Smith\u2019s\ninvocation of her Miranda rights during the following colloquy:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. And when she\u2019s arrested and she\n         is charged with a crime and provided an attorney, at that\n         point, she\u2019s not allowed to be interviewed, is that fair to\n         say, without the consent of her attorney?\n         \u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] You mean after she invoked?\u201d\n                                    46\n\fcounsel acted reasonably in making the tactical decision to decline the trial\ncourt\u2019s offer to provide such admonishment, the trial court was not obligated\nto grant a mistrial based on Dr. Mohandie\u2019s mere mention of Smith\u2019s having\n\u201cinvoked.\u201d This is particularly true given that Dr. Mohandie agreed with\ndefense counsel that Smith had not had an opportunity to make an \u201cofficial\nstatement\u201d between the time she was provided with an attorney and the time\nthat Dr. Stewart interviewed her. Finally, the trial court provided a reasoned\nexplanation for denying defense counsel\u2019s requested pinpoint instruction, i.e.,\nthe instruction was vague and unsupported by the evidence.\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not violate Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle and its progeny.\nE. The trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate Smith\u2019s\n   constitutional rights by refusing to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\n   during the sanity phase due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\n   provide the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court abused its discretion and violated her\nconstitutional rights in denying her request to preclude Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying during the sanity phase due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nprovide the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data.\n      A trial court\u2019s discovery rulings, including its resolution of claims\npertaining to the prosecution\u2019s alleged failure to timely comply with its\ndiscovery obligations, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. (People v. Mora\nand Rangel (2018) 5 Cal.5th 442, 466 (Mora and Rangel).) We review Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional claims de novo. (See People v. Salazar (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1031,\n1042 [Brady claim is reviewed de novo]; People v. Cromer (2001) 24 Cal.4th\n889, 901 [reviewing courts ordinarily apply independent review of\nconstitutional claims involving mixed questions of fact and law].)\n\n\n\n                                       47\n\f      1. Factual and procedural background\n            a. General background\n      Smith was arrested on August 13, 2015. She pled not guilty and not\nguilty by reason of insanity in May of 2017, at which time the trial court\nappointed two doctors, Drs. Cohen and Burke, to evaluate her. Dr. Cohen\nsubmitted a report to the court in November 2017. The following month,\nDr. Berke submitted a report to the court. In their reports, both doctors\nopined that Smith was insane at the time of the offense.\n      The People retained Dr. Mohandie in January 2018. On April 18,\nSmith withdrew her time waiver and the matter was set for trial, to\ncommence on May 21, 2018.\n      Dr. Mohandie interviewed Smith on May 2 and 7.\n      On May 21, and on several dates thereafter, the matter was continued.\nOn June 1, the matter was set for trial to commence on June 6.\n      Dr. Mohandie e-mailed the prosecutor his report on June 1. The\nprosecutor provided Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report to defense counsel that same day.\n      b. Smith\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\n      Smith filed a motion in limine on June 6 requesting that the trial court\nprohibit the prosecution from calling Dr. Mohandie as a witness. Smith\nrecounted the background of the case, including the facts pertaining to\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s retention by the prosecution, and Dr. Mohandie\u2019s interview of\nSmith on May 2 and 7. Defense counsel requested that the court preclude\n\nDr. Mohandie from testifying pursuant to section 1054.5, subdivision (b).31\n\n\n\n\n31    Section 1054.5, subdivision (b) provides a list of possible remedies for\nfailure to comply with California statutory discovery provisions, including\n\u201cdelaying or prohibiting the testimony of a witness or the presentation of real\nevidence.\u201d\n                                       48\n\f      On June 8, defense counsel filed a declaration in support of her motion\nto preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying. Defense counsel stated that on\nJune 4 and June 5, she had contacted three psychologists to potentially\nretain to review Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and data from the psychological\ntesting that he had performed. Defense counsel indicated that two of the\npsychologists had been unable to assist the defense, given time constraints\ndue to the imminence of the pending trial. One psychologist stated that he\nwould be unable to assist because he was on vacation. Defense counsel stated\nthat Dr. Mohandie still had not released the \u201craw data\u201d related to the\npsychological testing and noted that Dr. Mohandie would release the data\nonly to a defense retained psychologist.\n      The People filed a motion and supporting declaration pertaining to\ntheir request that Dr. Mohandie be allowed to testify. In the supporting\ndeclaration, the prosecutor provided a timeline of the events between\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s retention in January 2018 to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s production of his\nreport on June 1, 2018. The timeline noted that the manner by which\nDr. Mohandie would be permitted to examine Smith was litigated throughout\nearly 2018, including whether the examination would be videotaped, the\ntypes of psychological testing that would be permitted, and whether defense\ncounsel would be allowed to be present for the examination. The prosecutor\nalso noted that Dr. Mohandie had examined Smith on May 2 and 7, 2018, and\nthat it had taken Dr. Mohandie \u201c24 days to complete a 57-page report,\u201d which\nwas provided to the defense on June 1. The People contended that they had\n\u201cacted diligently and Dr. Mohandie acted diligently and reasonably, in\ncompleting the examination of defendant Smith.\u201d\n      The trial court held a hearing on the motion. At the June 8 hearing,\ndefense counsel acknowledged that the prosecutor had \u201cforward[ed] the\ninformation [from Dr. Mohandie] as soon as they received it,\u201d but argued that\n                                      49\n\fthe production \u201cwas not only untimely but extremely prejudicial.\u201d Defense\ncounsel emphasized that she had not been able to retain a psychologist to\nreview the psychological testing performed by Dr. Mohandie. Counsel also\nargued that the People had delayed too long in hiring Dr. Mohandie.\n      The prosecutor responded by arguing that it was not until two court\nappointed doctors, Drs. Cohen and Berke, had completed their reports in late\n2017 that the People retained a psychologist. The prosecutor argued \u201cwe\nwere waiting for the . . . appointed doctors to come back with their\nrecommendations,\u201d which the prosecutor characterized as \u201cnormal.\u201d\nThereafter, the prosecutor recounted various proceedings that were required\nin order for Dr. Mohandie to perform his evaluation, and argued, \u201c[B]ottom\nline . . . is that in my opinion Dr. Mohandie acted diligently and reasonably in\nsetting up the interviews, conducting the examination of the defendant, and\nproducing the report, and that was provided to the defense just as [defense\ncounsel] stated.\u201d\n      The court stated that it had discussed the case in chambers with\ncounsel, including the fact that the matter had \u201cproceed[ed] [on] a time\nwaived basis until April of 2018, and at that time[,] the time waiver was\nwithdrawn.\u201d However, the court noted that after the withdrawal of the time\nwaiver, the defense had agreed to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s examinations. The court\nultimately denied the motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying. The\ncourt also ruled that Dr. Mohandie would be permitted to rely on the results\nof the psychological testing that he had performed and ordered the prosecutor\nto tell Dr. Mohandie to provide the raw data from the psychological testing to\nany psychologist identified by the defense. The court further noted that it\nhad offered to continue the trial to give the defense time to retain a\npsychologist, but the defense had indicated that it wished to proceed.\n\n\n                                       50\n\f      After the trial court ruled, defense counsel stated that she wanted to\npreserve her objection, raised in chambers, that failing to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying would deny Smith the effective assistance of\ncounsel. Defense counsel, added, \u201cI also wanted the Court to know that I\nbelieve it\u2019s a violation of . . . both her state and federal due process rights.\u201d\n             c. Relevant trial proceedings\n\n      During the sanity phase of the trial, Dr. Cohen testified32 that she was\nfamiliar with two psychological tests that Dr. Mohandie had administered to\nSmith\u2014the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS) and the\nMinnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI-II). She explained\nthe ways in which the SIRS test functions and the ways in which it is used to\ndetect malingering. She was \u201cvery familiar\u201d with the MMPI-II, and discussed\nits use, scoring, and functions at length. In addition, Dr. Cohen testified that\nDr. Mohandie had sent her Smith\u2019s MMPI-II and SIRS test data and she had\nreviewed in detail Smith\u2019s scores on various components of the MMPI-II.\nDr. Berke also testified and explained that Smith had no scores in either the\n\u201cdefinite\u201d or \u201cprobable feigning\u201d range on the SIRS test.\n\n      The defense also cross-examined Dr. Mohandie33 at length pertaining\nto both the SIRS and the MMPI-II tests. Dr. Mohandie agreed with defense\ncounsel that Smith\u2019s SIRS test \u201ccame back as her being honest.\u201d\nDr. Mohandie also stated that the MMPI-II test validated his diagnosis of\n\u201cmajor depression.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n32     Dr. Cohen testified on July 3, 2018, nearly one month after the court\u2019s\nJune 8, 2018 hearing on Smith\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying.\n\n33    The cross-examination occurred on July 5, 2018.\n                                    51\n\f         At the conclusion of the sanity phase of the trial, outside the presence\nof the jury, the trial court stated that it was denying a defense request for a\njury instruction pertaining to the untimely disclosure of evidence. The court\nsaid that the primary reason that it was denying the request was because the\ncourt had offered to continue the trial to permit the defense additional time to\nrespond to Dr, Mohandie\u2019s report and the defense had declined the court\u2019s\noffer.\n         2. Governing law\n         Section 1054.1 outlines a prosecutor\u2019s discovery obligations and\nprovides in relevant part:\n            \u201cThe prosecuting attorney shall disclose to the defendant or\n            his or her attorney all of the following materials and\n            information, if it is in the possession of the prosecuting\n            attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the\n            possession of the investigating agencies:\n\n            \u201c[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n            \u201c(e) Any exculpatory evidence.\n\n            \u201c(f) Relevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or\n            reports of the statements of witnesses whom the prosecutor\n            intends to call at the trial, including any reports or\n            statements of experts made in conjunction with the case,\n            including the results of physical or mental examinations,\n            scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons which the\n            prosecutor intends to offer in evidence at the trial.\u201d\n\n         Section 1054.7 provides the time frame within which discovery\ndisclosures must be made and provides in relevant part:\n            \u201cThe disclosures required under this chapter shall be made\n            at least 30 days prior to the trial, unless good cause is\n            shown why a disclosure should be denied, restricted, or\n            deferred. If the material and information becomes known\n            to, or comes into the possession of, a party within 30 days of\n\n                                         52\n\f         trial, disclosure shall be made immediately, unless good\n         cause is shown why a disclosure should be denied,\n         restricted, or deferred.\u201d\n\n      Section 1054.5 prescribes various remedies that a court may employ for\na discovery violation in relevant part as follows:\n         \u201c(b) . . . Upon a showing that a party has not complied with\n         Section 1054.1 . . . and upon a showing that the moving\n         party complied with the informal discovery procedure\n         provided in this subdivision, a court may make any order\n         necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter,\n         including, but not limited to, immediate disclosure,\n         contempt proceedings, delaying or prohibiting the\n         testimony of a witness or the presentation of real evidence,\n         continuance of the matter, or any other lawful order.\n         Further, the court may advise the jury of any failure or\n         refusal to disclose and of any untimely disclosure.\n\n         \u201c(c) The court may prohibit the testimony of a witness\n         pursuant to subdivision (b) only if all other sanctions have\n         been exhausted. The court shall not dismiss a charge\n         pursuant to subdivision (b) unless required to do so by the\n         Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\n      In People v. Lewis (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 257 (Lewis), the Court of\nAppeal summarized the relevant law governing a claim under Brady v.\nMaryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83 (Brady):\n         \u201cUnder Brady, the prosecution violates a defendant\u2019s\n         federal due process rights when it suppresses evidence\n         material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment, regardless\n         of the good faith belief of the prosecution. (Brady, supra,\n         373 U.S. at p. 87.) Prosecutors have a duty to disclose\n         \u2018material exculpatory evidence whether the defendant\n         makes a specific request [citation], a general request, or\n         none at all [citation].\u2019 [Citation.] There are three elements\n         to a Brady violation: (1) the state withholds evidence,\n         either willfully or inadvertently, (2) the evidence at issue is\n         favorable to the defendant, either because it is exculpatory\n\n                                       53\n\f         or impeaching, and (3) the evidence is material. [Citation.]\u201d\n         (Lewis, supra, at p. 263.)\n\n      \u201cEvidence actually presented at trial is not considered suppressed for\nBrady purposes, even if that evidence had not been previously disclosed\nduring discovery.\u201d (Mora and Rangel, supra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 467.)\n      3. Application\n      It is undisputed that the prosecutor disclosed Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report to\n\ndefense counsel on the same day that the prosecutor received the report.34\nThus, the prosecutor complied with section 1054.7. (See \u00a7 1054.7 [\u201cIf the\nmaterial and information becomes known to, or comes into the possession of,\na party within 30 days of trial, disclosure shall be made immediately\u201d].)\nWhile Smith asserts that Dr. Mohandie was \u201can auxiliary service for the\nprosecutor, and thus part of the prosecution,\u201d she fails to cite any case law\nsupporting the proposition that a retained expert is considered a component\nof the prosecution for purposes of section 1054.7. Further, even assuming\nthat Dr. Mohandie could be considered \u201ca party\u201d for purposes of section\n1054.7, Smith makes no showing that Dr. Mohandie failed to disclose the\nreport as soon as he prepared it. Thus, we see no basis for concluding that\nthe trial court erred in refusing to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\nbased on the failure to timely disclose his report. (See, e.g., People v. Panah\n\n\n\n34    In addition, although Smith appears to base her claim in part on the\nalleged late disclosure of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s test data, Smith does not point to\nany evidence in the record indicating precisely when Dr. Cohen received the\ndata. However, Dr. Cohen testified at trial about her review of the \u201craw data\nthat was sent to [her] by [Dr. Mohandie],\u201d and she testified that \u201c[l]ooking at\nthe MMPI[-II] -- really, you know, looking at it in detail, confirmed my\nopinion.\u201d In short, Smith fails to demonstrate on appeal that any delay in\nsending the data to Dr. Cohen impeded Dr. Cohen\u2019s ability to conduct an\nanalysis of the data.\n                                      54\n\f(2005) 35 Cal.4th 395, 460 (Panah) [concluding that prosecution\u2019s disclosure\nof coroner\u2019s report prepared within 30 days of trial was timely under\ndiscovery statutes].)\n      We are similarly unpersuaded by Smith\u2019s assertion that the trial court\nshould have employed the drastic sanction of precluding Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying because the late discovery of the report was allegedly based on the\nprosecution\u2019s delay in retaining Dr. Mohandie and \u201cpermitting such a\ndeliberate evaluation process.\u201d The trial court could have reasonably\ndetermined that the prosecution retained Dr. Mohandie in a timely matter,\nshortly after the court appointed experts had submitted their reports opining\nthat Smith was insane at the time of the charged offense. Further, the trial\ncourt could also have reasonably determined that the approximately four-\nmonth period between the time that the People retained Dr. Mohandie and\nthe time that he interviewed Smith was not unduly long in light of litigation\nconcerning the scope of his examination, as well time that Dr. Mohandie\ncould reasonably have been expected to need to prepare for the examination.\nIn addition, the record indicates that Dr. Mohandie completed his report in a\ntimely matter, less than a month after interviewing Smith. In sum, the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying given the absence of any demonstration that\nthe prosecutor violated section 1054.7.\n      We also reject Smith\u2019s Brady claim, given her failure to make any\nshowing that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report was suppressed. (See Lewis, supra,\n240 Cal.App.4th at p. 263 [first element of a Brady claim is that \u201cthe state\nwithholds evidence, either willfully or inadvertently\u201d].) As discussed ante,\nthe prosecutor provided the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report on the same\nday that the prosecutor received it, which was nearly a month prior to\ndefense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Mohandie and presentation of\n                                      55\n\fexpert testimony evaluating Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report. (See Mora and Rangel,\nsupra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 467 [noting that evidence presented at trial is not\nconsidered to have been suppressed, particularly where defendant has not\nmade a showing that any delay in disclosure prevented defense counsel from\neffectively preparing and presenting a defense].) Finally, in light our\nconclusion that the trial court did not err in determining that the prosecutor\nhad not violated California\u2019s statutory discovery law or Brady, and after\nconsideration of Smith\u2019s presentation of a defense during the sanity phase of\nthe trial, including her counsel\u2019s extensive cross-examination of\nDr. Mohandie and presentation of Dr. Berke and Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony with\nrespect to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s psychological testing, we reject Smith\u2019s contention\nthat \u201c[l]ate disclosure also deprived [Smith] of an adequate opportunity to\npresent a complete defense and for counsel to be effective at trial.\u201d35 (Cf.\nPeople v. Thompson (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1043, 1105 [\u201cthe proper exercise of a\ntrial court\u2019s discretion under section 1054.7 does not violate a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s confrontation or due process rights\u201d]; Panah, supra, 35 Cal.4th at\np. 460 [\u201cwe reject the edifice of constitutional error that defendant constructs\nupon his claim of discovery violation\u201d].)\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion or violate Smith\u2019s constitutional rights by refusing to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nprovide Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data.\n\n\n\n\n35    While Smith argues that the \u201cdefense was not prepared\u201d to attack\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s opinion, she fails to address specifically what testimony or\nevidence defense counsel could have presented if Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and\ndata had been provided to the defense earlier.\n                                       56\n\fF. Smith is not entitled to reversal of the sanity verdict pursuant to the\n   cumulative error doctrine\n\n      As with the guilt phase, Smith contends that the cumulative effect of\nthe errors that she alleges occurred during the sanity phase requires reversal\nof the sanity verdict. We have found no errors to cumulate. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the cumulative error doctrine does not require reversal of the\nsanity verdict.\n                                    IV.\n                                DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                              AARON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nO\u2019ROURKE, Acting P.

Code, \u00a7 187)1 and found true a deadly\nweapon enhancement allegation (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)).2 Smith\u2019s mother,\nAnne Smith (Anne), was the victim. During the sanity phase of the trial, the\njury found that Smith was legally sane at the time she committed the offense.\nThe trial court sentenced Smith to a term of 16 years to life in prison,\nconsisting of a 15 years to life term for the murder and a one-year consecutive\nterm for the deadly weapon enhancement.\n      On appeal, with respect to the guilt phase, Smith claims that the trial\ncourt erred in excluding certain evidence pertaining to the severity of her\ndepression at the time of the incident giving rise to the charged offense. In\naddition, Smith contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the\njury sua sponte on involuntary manslaughter as an uncharged lesser\nincluded offense to murder. Smith also maintains that the cumulative error\ndoctrine requires reversal of the guilt-phase verdicts.\n      With respect to the sanity phase, Smith claims that the trial court\nviolated her constitutional right to due process under Doyle v. Ohio (1976)\n426 U.S. 610, 618 (Doyle) and its progeny by admitting evidence that she\nclaims amounted to a comment on her exercise of her right to remain silent\npursuant to Miranda v. Arizona (l966) 384 U.S. 436 (Miranda). She also\nmaintains that the trial court erred in refusing to preclude an expert retained\nby the prosecution from testifying due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\n\n\n1     Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent statutory references are to\nthe Penal Code.\n\n2     The jury found Smith not guilty of first-degree murder.\n                                      2\n\fprovide the defense with the expert\u2019s report and related data. Finally, Smith\ncontends that the cumulative error doctrine requires reversal of the sanity\nverdict.\n      In a published portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court\ndid not err in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of\ninvoluntary manslaughter because there is no substantial evidence in the\nrecord to support the giving of the instruction. In another published portion\nof this opinion, we conclude that the trial court did not commit Doyle error.\nWe reject the remainder of Smith\u2019s claims in unpublished portions of this\nopinion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n                                        II.\n                          FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA. Guilt-phase evidence\n      1. Smith\u2019s mental illness\n      Smith suffered from depression for many years. In 1995, Smith began\nto see a psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Brauer, on a somewhat regular basis and\ncontinued to see him until shortly before her commission of the offense.\nDr. Brauer testified that he had diagnosed Smith with both major depressive\ndisorder and dysthymia, with the former being more severe and episodic, and\nthe latter being a milder version of the disorder that was longer lasting.\nDr. Brauer prescribed various psychiatric medications to Smith throughout\nthe time that he treated her. Smith also received care from a different\nphysician, Dr. Schwartley, for a thyroid condition.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      2. Smith\u2019s December 2014 move into Anne\u2019s residence\n      Smith moved into Anne\u2019s residence in December 2014.3 After Smith\nmoved in, Anne became concerned that Smith was sleeping excessively. She\ncalled Dr. Brauer\u2019s office to let him know that Smith was sleeping about\n18 hours per day. Anne was also concerned about the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d that\nSmith owned. Anne\u2019s desire to give away Smith\u2019s clothes was a source of\nconflict between the two.\n      3. The murder\n      On August 12, 2015, during an argument, Smith hit Anne in the head\nrepeatedly with a hammer, killing her.\n      4. Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call4\n      The next afternoon, Smith called 9-1-1 and told the operator that she\nhad killed her mother. Smith told the operator, \u201cWe had a terrible fight, and\nI killed her with a hammer.\u201d After Smith told the operator that the killing\nhad taken place the prior day, the operator asked Smith why she had waited\nso long to call 9-1-1. Smith responded, \u201cI just freaked out, and I was just\ntrying to, I don\u2019t know, I was trying to sleep and pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nWhen asked by the operator what the argument was about, Smith said that\nher mother was \u201cgonna give all my clothes away.\u201d Smith added that she had\n\u201cborrowed a lot of her [mother\u2019s] money,\u201d and also noted that she and her\nmother would both become \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Smith also told the 9-1-1\noperator about her strange sleep patterns, which Smith stated was caused by\nantidepressants that she was taking.\n\n\n3    Smith testified that she had previously lived with Anne for\napproximately 21 days in 2013. According to Smith, she moved out and told\nAnne that she could not live with Anne.\n\n4     The 9-1-1 call was played for the jury during the trial.\n                                       4\n\f      5. The investigation\n      When police arrived, they found Anne\u2019s body in the living room. There\nwas a hammer close to her body. Portions of Anne\u2019s skull were on the\nground, eight to ten feet from her body, and her brain matter was exposed in\nthe areas where the skull was missing. Anne suffered eight lacerations in the\narea above her left ear and behind her forehead, as well as extensive skull\nfractures and injuries to the brain. According to a medical examiner, Anne\u2019s\ncause of death was \u201c[b]lunt force injuries including cranial cerebral injuries\ndue to strikes by [a] hammer.\u201d\n      In addition to fatal head injuries, Anne had a number of defensive\ninjuries consisting of lacerations and contusions on both forearms and on one\nof her hands, as well as fractures to her left wrist and forearm. Smith\nsuffered no physical injuries.\n      Shortly after her arrest, while in a patrol car, Smith told a detective at\nthe scene, \u201cI killed my mom.\u201d\n      6. The defense\n      Smith testified and admitted killing Anne with a hammer. According\nto Smith, on the morning of the killing, she and her mother were packing up\nsome of Smith\u2019s belongings that Anne had insisted Smith donate to charity.\nThis was upsetting to Smith. While they were packing, Anne made several\ndemeaning comments to Smith, and a heated verbal argument ensued.\n      During the argument, Smith picked up a hammer. Anne attempted to\ntake the hammer from Smith and the two began to struggle. Smith hit her\nmother on the head with the hammer four times. Smith testified that she\nthought that the incident was a dream. Smith stated, \u201cAnd I hit her with a\nhammer in the head, and I remember hitting her four times, all in a row, like\nreally fast, and it was like a dream.\u201d\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      After killing her mother, Smith went to bed in the hope that the\n\u201cdream\u201d would end. She called the police the following morning and told the\n9-1-1 operator that she had killed her mother.\n      Dr. Pablo Stewart, a psychiatrist, testified that Smith suffered from\nmajor depressive disorder and hypothyroidism. Dr. Stewart suggested that\nthe evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the killing could have\ncaused Smith to act rashly and out of emotion or passion rather than\njudgment.\nB. Sanity-phase evidence\n      1. The defense\u2019s presentation of evidence of Smith\u2019s insanity\n      The defense presented three mental health experts, each of whom\nopined that Smith was insane at the time of the killing. Two court-appointed\nexperts, Dr. David Berke and Dr. Ashley Cohen, opined that Smith did not\nknow the nature and quality of her acts and she did not appreciate that her\nacts were legally or morally wrong. The third expert, Dr. Stewart,5 testified\nthat, in his opinion, Smith knew the nature and quality of her acts, but did\nnot know that her acts were legally or morally wrong.\n      All three experts diagnosed Smith as suffering major depressive\ndisorder and hypothyroidism. In addition, each of the three experts stated\nthat, in their opinion, Smith had suffered an episode of depersonalization and\nderealization\u2014a mental disorder prompted by stress\u2014at the time of the\nkilling. Dr. Stewart described depersonalization and derealization as \u201csort of\nlooking down at oneself being in some sort of a dream state, not being in full\ncontrol of your body functions and your thought processes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n5      Dr. Stewart was retained by the defense and he testified in both the\nguilt and sanity phases of the trial.\n                                      6\n\f      The doctors each interviewed Smith, and her statements during these\ninterviews formed part of each doctor\u2019s assessment that Smith had suffered a\ndissociative experience at the time of the offense. For example, Dr. Stewart\nstated, \u201cBased on my interview with her, which was confirmed by her\ntestimony where she said she flipped out and that she was in a dream -- felt\nlike she was in a dream, all of that is -- I'm convinced that she was in a period\nof depersonalization at the time of the crime.\u201d Dr. Berke stated that Smith\nhad described herself as being like a passenger in a car and in a dream.\nSimilarly, Dr. Cohen agreed with defense counsel that Smith had described\nher mental state at the time of the offense as \u201calmost being two different\npeople, one, a passenger in a vehicle, and one was driving the vehicle.\u201d\n      2. The People\u2019s presentation of evidence of Smith\u2019s sanity\n      The prosecution presented the testimony of psychologist Dr. Kris\nMohandie. Dr. Mohandie opined that Smith\u2019s claim of being \u201cout of body as if\na passenger . . . in a vehicle,\u201d during the offense was \u201cmalingered,\u201d and\n\u201cmanufactured,\u201d and that Smith\u2019s claim of experiencing that \u201csymptom [was]\nbogus.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\u2019s conclusion was based, in part, on his review of\nSmith\u2019s 9-1-1 call. Specifically, Dr. Mohandie pointed to Smith\u2019s\n\u201cextraordinary sharing of information spontaneously in [the] 9-1-1 call,\u201d and\nthe \u201cemotionality,\u201d that she displayed during the call, both of which\nDr. Mohandie stated, \u201cyou don\u2019t see if a person is out of body, if you will, or\ndistancing themselves from what has happened.\u201d Dr. Mohandie also noted\nthat Smith described the killing during the 9-1-1 call in a manner that\nindicated that she knew that the killing had happened, noting that Smith\nhad said on the 9-1-1- call, \u201c \u2018I tried to pretend that it didn\u2019t happen.\u2019 \u201d\n      In addition, Dr. Mohandie stated that, during his interview of Smith,\nshe used language that was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with an out-of-body\nexperience,\u201d including \u201cus[ing] feeling terms when . . . describ[ing] the\n                                         7\n\fviolence that she inflicted upon her mother.\u201d6 Dr. Mohandie also noted that\nin describing the events surrounding the killing during his interviews with\nher, Smith displayed \u201cno hazing of consciousness,\u201d and that the \u201cgestures\nthat [Smith] ma[de] spontaneously while describing these things, [were] . . .\ninconsistent with some sort of out of body experience.\u201d\n      Another factor that caused Dr. Mohandie to \u201crule[ ] out,\u201d \u201cderealization\nor depersonalization,\u201d was that Smith had not experienced dissociation on a\nrecurrent basis. Dr. Mohandie noted that there was \u201cno evidence of any\ndissociative or depersonalization experiences before or after.\u201d In addition,\nDr. Mohandie noted that episodes of depersonalization and derealization are\nordinarily prompted by \u201can acute stressor,\u201d and observed that \u201c[t]here\u2019s\nnothing about that episode [before the killing] that\u2019s going to cause violence.\u201d\nDr. Mohandie also stated that Smith had engaged in \u201cgoal-directed\u201d behavior\nnear the time of the offense, including retrieving a hammer, that was\ninconsistent with Smith\u2019s claim of having suffered a dissociative experience.\n      Dr. Mohandie supported his opinion that Smith was malingering by\nstating that there was evidence that Smith had engaged in malingering while\nincarcerated after her arrest. Specifically, Dr. Mohandie referred to an\nincident during which \u201c[Smith] exaggerated and made suicidal statements as\na way of trying to get her medications renewed or expedited.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\nalso noted that there was evidence that Smith had reviewed a mental health\nreport while she was undergoing mental health evaluations, which was\n\u201cconcerning,\u201d because it could \u201cpotentially . . . contaminate and educate\n[Smith] further even about how this process works.\u201d Dr. Mohandie did\nacknowledge that Smith had received a score of \u201chonest responding,\u201d on a\n\n\n\n6     During the sanity phase, the People played two video recordings of\nportions of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s interviews of Smith.\n                                      8\n\fpsychological test that he administered to her called the Structured Interview\nof Reported Symptoms (SIRS), which is designed to detecting malingering.7\n      Dr. Mohandie opined that at the time of the murder, Smith knew the\nnature and quality of her actions and knew that her actions were both\nmorally and legally wrong. He believed that Smith was \u201cabsolutely sane.\u201d\n                                       III.\n                                 DISCUSSION\nA. Smith fails to establish any error with respect to either the trial court\u2019s\n   limitation of the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony or the trial court\u2019s\n   exclusion of testimony pertaining to Smith\u2019s journal entries\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in excluding evidence during the\nguilt phase of the trial pertaining to the severity of her depression at the time\nof the incident. Specifically, Smith claims that the trial court erred in\nlimiting the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony concerning her level of\ndepression at the time of the incident and excluding testimony pertaining to\nSmith\u2019s journal entries related to her depression. Smith claims that the\nevidence was relevant to rebut evidence that the People had presented to\nshow that \u201c[her] depression was not severe and [was] improving.\u201d\n      1. The People\u2019s presentation of evidence pertaining to Smith\u2019s\n         statements concerning her level of depression in 2014 and 2015\n\n      Dr. Brauer testified that Smith told him during a July 2014 visit that\nshe was \u201cfeeling better,\u201d and he noted that \u201cshe had low anxiety and mild\ndepression\u201d at that time. Dr. Brauer also stated that he spoke with Smith in\n\n\n7       Dr. Mohandie also administered the Minnesota Multi-Phasic\nPersonality Inventory-II (MMPI-II) psychological test to Smith.\nDr. Mohandie stated that the results of this test showed that there \u201cwas some\ntendency to over-endorse or exaggerate what was going on.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\nalso testified that the MMPI-II was \u201cpicking up depression,\u201d and it \u201cpicked\nup . . . anxiety.\u201d\n                                      9\n\fOctober 2014 and that she \u201cdescribed feeling minimally depressed and\n[having] low-level anxiety.\u201d Dr. Brauer further stated that Smith wrote in\nJanuary 2015 that she was \u201cfeeling better.\u201d Finally, when asked how Smith\nappeared at an April 2015 visit, Dr. Brauer testified:\n          \u201cShe was in pretty good condition. She reported -- in her\n          handwriting again -- \u2018feeling better.\u2019 I judged her stable.\n          She had no complaints. She mentioned that she was living\n          with her mother in Sunnyvale, and my mental status exam,\n          at that point, was unremarkable, you know, she was -- I\n          noted her as being appropriate in appearance, appropriate\n          in behavior, with mild depression and mild anxiety, not\n          tearful, oriented times [three], no side effects, alert, no\n          essential change in her mental status.\u201d\n\n      2. Smith did not preserve her claim that the trial court erroneously\n         limited the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony\n\n             a. Factual and procedural background\n      After the prosecutor called its last witness in the guilt phase, the trial\ncourt held a hearing with counsel outside the presence of the jury. During\nthe hearing, the prosecutor indicated that both parties had \u201csupplemental\n\nmotions,\u201d with respect to Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony.8 The prosecutor indicated\nthat he did not want Dr. Stewart to testify about Smith\u2019s sanity during the\nguilt phase of the trial.\n      In response, defense counsel stated that it was not her intention to\nhave Dr. Stewart testify about \u201canything regarding sanity.\u201d Thereafter, the\ncourt clarified, \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to get into his examination of Ms. Smith,\nright?\u201d\n\n\n8     Although it appears that the People and the defense drafted written\nmotions concerning Dr. Stewart\u2019s prospective testimony, neither party cites\nto such motions in their brief on appeal and no such motions appear in the\nrecord.\n                                      10\n\f      Defense counsel explained that it was her intention \u201cto introduce\ntestimony that [Dr. Stewart] has diagnosed [Smith] with major depressive\ndisorder . . . during his evaluation.\u201d\n      After the court expressed skepticism concerning the relevance of such a\ndiagnosis, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that [Dr. Stewart] can get up\nhere and testify about everything that the defendant told him . . . .\u201d\n      After further discussions among the court, the prosecutor, and defense\ncounsel concerning the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony, the hearing\nconcluded with the following colloquy:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Is the Court concerned that these\n         statements [that Smith made to Dr. Stewart during his\n         interviews with her after her arrest] have not been\n         introduced to the jury during the trial? Is that what the\n         Court is concerned about?\n\n         \u201c[The court:] If that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about -- if you\n         want to say more than the generalized comments,[9] then\n         there is no evidence of that.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] And I don\u2019t know how that comes in.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Unless you call your client.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n\n\n9     Earlier in the hearing, the trial court stated, \u201cI have no problem with\n[Dr. Stewart] reviewing medical records, and saying that, you know, based on\nmy review of the medical records, not based on my discussions with\nMs. Smith, not based on my examination, not based on any tests, not based\non anything that he did after August 13th of 2015[, the day after the murder],\nhe can render his opinions, because I think that\u2019s fair game.\u201d\n                                        11\n\f         \u201c[The court:] But I\u2019m not going to let him come in and say,\n         \u2018Well,\u2019 you know, \u2018I interviewed her in 2016, and she told\n         me this, this, and this, and therefore, I believe that at the\n         time of the incident, she was acting out of a rash impulse\n         and not reason.\u2019\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] I\u2019m not going to allow that, okay? So we can go\n         over it a little more at 1:30 to flesh it out or before the\n         witness testifies so that there\u2019s no question about where you\n         can go and what you can and cannot do with the\n         witness.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. Thank you.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Thank you.\u201d (Italics added.)10\n\n      Smith testified during the defense\u2019s presentation of evidence.\n      The defense did not further discuss the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony\nwith the court prior to Dr. Stewart testifying. During his testimony,\nDr. Stewart stated that he had interviewed Smith on two separate occasions.\nThereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Now I\u2019m going to ask you about your\n         review of these records. After reviewing Dr. Brauer\u2019s\n         records, Dr. Schwartley\u2019s records, your interview with\n         Ms. Linde Smith, interview with the different family\n         members, did you have an opinion as to Ms. Smith\u2019s\n         diagnosis?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] And what was that opinion?\n\n\n\n\n10    The colloquy is taken from page 976 of the reporter\u2019s transcript.\n                                     12\n\f         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] After conducting the review that you just\n         said, it was my opinion that Ms. Smith has suffered from\n         major depressive disorder for an extended period of time.\u201d\n\n            b. Governing law\n      \u201cWhere the court rejects evidence temporarily or withholds a decision\nas to its admissibility, the party desiring to introduce the evidence should\nrenew his offer, or call the court\u2019s attention to the fact that a definite decision\nis desired.\u201d (People v. Holloway (2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 133, internal quotation\nmarks omitted; see, e.g., People v. Smith (2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 632 (Smith)\n[because defendant failed to renew request to admit certain evidence for\nspecific reasons, he \u201cmay not now argue on that basis that its exclusion was\nerror,\u201d citing Evid.

Smith\u2019s claim on appeal\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in prohibiting Dr. Stewart from\ntestifying that Smith was \u201cwas depressed at the time of the incident.\u201d The\n\n\n11    Evidence Code section 354 provides in relevant part:\n         \u201cA verdict or finding shall not be set aside, nor shall the\n         judgment or decision based thereon be reversed, by reason\n         of the erroneous exclusion of evidence unless the court\n         which passes upon the effect of the error or errors is of the\n         opinion that the error or errors complained of resulted in a\n         miscarriage of justice and it appears of record that:\n         \u201c(a) The substance, purpose, and relevance of the excluded\n         evidence was made known to the court by the questions\n         asked, an offer of proof, or by any other means; [or]\n         \u201c(b) The rulings of the court made compliance with\n         subdivision (a) futile[.]\u201d\n                                       13\n\fPeople argue in their respondent\u2019s brief that Smith cannot establish her\nclaimed error because \u201cthe evidence she contends should have been admitted\nwas admitted at trial and before the jury for its consideration.\u201d In response\nto the People\u2019s argument, Smith argues as follows in her reply brief:\n         \u201cDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony that appellant had major\n         depressive disorder for an extended period did not mean\n         she was significantly depressed at the time of the incident.\n         Even if the jury could infer this from his testimony, he\n         provided no facts to explain why he reached an opposite\n         conclusion from her treating psychiatrist. What was\n         missing was that the opinion was based on specific\n         information he obtained from evaluating appellant and that\n         this was why he opined her depression continued to be\n         significant up to the time of the incident. This is what the\n         court excluded. [Citation.][12]\n\n         \u201cAn opinion is only as good as the basis it rests on.\n         [Citation.] A broad statement that Dr. Stewart interviewed\n         appellant did not provide a factual basis for why he opined\n         she was depressed at the time of the incident. Absent the\n         presentation of new information obtained from the\n         interview, the jury was left to conclude his opinion was\n         simply his own interpretation of the same evidence the jury\n         already heard. While this was partly true, Dr. Stewart\u2019s\n         opinion was also based on specific facts obtained from the\n         interview, which the jury was not allowed to hear.\u201d\n\n            d. Application\n      During the trial court\u2019s discussion with the prosecutor and defense\ncounsel, the trial court expressed reservations about permitting Dr. Stewart\nto testify to out-of-court statements that Smith made to Dr. Stewart during\nhis evaluation of her. However, the court made clear that its ruling was\nsubject to further consideration; the court stated, \u201cwe can go over it a little\n\n\n12   This citation is to page 976 of the reporter\u2019s transcript, which we\nquoted in part III.A.2.a, ante. (See fn. 10, ante.)\n                                        14\n\fmore . . . before the witness testifies so that there\u2019s no question about where\nyou can go and what you can and cannot do with the witness.\u201d However,\ndefense counsel never sought further clarification from the trial court as to\nthe permissible scope of her examination of the witness.\n      Further, and critically, at no time during defense counsel\u2019s examination\nof Dr. Stewart did the trial court limit Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony in any fashion.\nSpecifically, at no time during Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony did the trial court\nlimit Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony with respect to specific statements that Smith\nmade to him during his examination of her, and there is no offer of proof or\n\nother record of such excluded statements in the record on appeal.13 To the\nextent that the defense wanted to present, as Smith claims on appeal,\n\u201cspecific information [that Dr. Stewart] obtained from evaluating [Smith],\u201d so\nthat Dr. Stewart could explain \u201cthat this was why he opined [Smith\u2019s]\ndepression continued to be significant up to the time of the incident,\u201d the\ndefense was obligated to \u201crenew [its] request\u201d to admit such evidence for\nthese specific reasons. (Smith, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 632.) The defense\u2019s\nfailure to do so at any time during Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony precludes Smith\nfrom arguing on appeal that the trial court erred in purportedly limiting\nDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony (see ibid.) and precludes this court from reversing on\nthat ground. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.)\n      Accordingly, we conclude that Smith did not adequately preserve her\nclaim that the trial court erroneously limited the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n13    Indeed, Smith fails, even in her brief on appeal, to specify what\n\u201cspecific information,\u201d from Dr. Stewart\u2019s evaluation she was purportedly\nimproperly prevented from presenting at trial.\n                                      15\n\f      3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony\n         pertaining to Smith\u2019s journal entries\n\n            a. Factual and procedural background\n      The defense called City of Sunnyvale Detective Matthew Hutchinson as\na witness. Defense counsel asked Detective Hutchinson whether he had had\nthe opportunity to review \u201csome journal entries that were made by Linde\nSmith in this case.\u201d Detective Hutchinson responded in the affirmative.\nShortly thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Is it true that Ms. Smith had journal\n         entries about feeling depressed?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Objection. Hearsay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Sustained. Can I see counsel in the\n         hallway[?]\u201d\n\n      After the conference in the hallway, defense counsel indicated that she\nhad no further questions.\n      Subsequently, outside the presence of the jury, the following colloquy\noccurred pertaining to the court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, in regards to Officer -- or\n         Detective Hutchinson\u2019s testimony, the Defense sought to\n         elicit testimony from the detective that he reviewed a\n         journal that Ms. Smith had kept. In the journal, she made\n         entries about feeling depressed, unmotivated, experiencing\n         recurring nausea. I believe the Court -- there was an\n         objection as to hearsay, the Defense believed that this was\n         a prior consistent statement to rebut what Dr. Brauer had\n         said regarding the fact that Ms. Smith had indicated her\n         depression was under control.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Do you want to say anything?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Submitted.\n\n\n                                      16\n\f        \u201c[The court:] All right. As I indicated, the questions had to\n        do with the officer talking about entries in the journal that\n        was found in the defendant\u2019s room, I guess. And at one\n        point, when we were in the hallway, defense counsel said\n        that she believed that these statements were prior\n        consistent statements. If so, there was no intervening prior\n        inconsistent statements such that they would become\n        relevant, and to -- and I didn\u2019t think there was an adequate\n        foundation for the fact that the journal was hers that could\n        be laid by that witness, and so I precluded that testimony.\u201d\n\n            b. Governing law and standard of review\n     Evidence Code sections 1236 and 791 pertain to the admissibility of\nprior consistent statements of a witness. Evidence Code section 1236\nprovides:\n        \u201cEvidence of a statement previously made by a witness is\n        not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement\n        is consistent with his testimony at the hearing and is\n        offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section 791.\u201d\n\n     Evidence Code section 791 provides:\n\n        \u201cEvidence of a statement previously made by a witness that\n        is consistent with his testimony at the hearing is\n        inadmissible to support his credibility unless it is offered\n        after:\n\n        \u201c(a) Evidence of a statement made by him that is\n        inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing\n        has been admitted for the purpose of attacking his\n        credibility, and the statement was made before the alleged\n        inconsistent statement; or\n\n        \u201c(b) An express or implied charge has been made that his\n        testimony at the hearing is recently fabricated or is\n        influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the\n        statement was made before the bias, motive for fabrication,\n        or other improper motive is alleged to have arisen.\u201d\n\n\n                                     17\n\f      Evidence Code section 1202 pertains to evidence offered to attack or\nsupport the credibility of a hearsay declarant and provides in relevant part:\n         \u201cEvidence of a statement or other conduct by a declarant\n         that is inconsistent with a statement by such declarant\n         received in evidence as hearsay evidence is not\n         inadmissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of\n         the declarant though he is not given and has not had an\n         opportunity to explain or to deny such inconsistent\n         statement or other conduct. Any other evidence offered to\n         attack or support the credibility of the declarant is\n         admissible if it would have been admissible had the\n         declarant been a witness at the hearing.\u201d\n\n      We review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\n(See, e.g., People v. Guerra (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1067, 1113 [abuse of discretion\nstandard of review applies to any ruling by a trial court on the admissibility\nof evidence].)\n            c. Application\n      On appeal, Smith argues that testimony concerning the journal entries\nwas admissible under Evidence Code section 1202 to impeach Dr. Brauer\u2019s\ntestimony that Smith had \u201creported to him only mild depression and she was\n\nfeeling better.\u201d14 In other words, Smith claims that the evidence was\n\n\n14     In her opening brief, Smith also appears to assert that her journal\nentries were admissible pursuant to Evidence Code sections 791 and 1236 as\nevidence of her prior consistent statements. The journal entries were not\nadmissible pursuant to sections 791 and 1236 because these sections pertain\nto the prior consistent statements of \u201ca witness\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 791, 1236, italics added),\nand at the time Smith sought admission of the statements at trial, she had\nnot yet testified and was therefore not a witness. Smith acknowledges this\nfact in her reply brief, stating:\n         \u201c[Smith] was not called as a witness before Hutchinson\n         testified. At that time, it was her out of court statements\n         that the defense sought to address.\u201d (Italics added.)\n                                       18\n\fadmissible to attack the statements that Dr. Brauer attributed to Smith\npertaining to her mental health during several medical appointments in 2014\nand 2015. (See People v. Baldwin (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 991, 1005 [stating\nthat when a defendant seeks to admit his or her extrajudicial statements\npursuant to Evidence Code section 1202 such statements are \u201cadmissible\nsolely to attack the credibility of the defendant as a declarant in the party\n\nadmissions used against him\u201d (italics omitted)].15 This argument fails\nbecause the only offer of proof as to the content of the journal entries was\ndefense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]n the journal, [Smith] made entries about\nfeeling depressed, unmotivated, experiencing recurring nausea.\u201d Defense\ncounsel did not, however, discuss the time frame to which the journal entries\nreferred. Generic statements that, at some unspecified times, Smith was\nfeeling depressed, did not reasonably impeach evidence of her own\nstatements to Dr. Brauer, made during medical appointments in 2014 and\n2015, that she was \u201c \u2018feeling better.\u2019 \u201d\n      Accordingly, we conclude that Smith has not demonstrated that\ntestimony as to the journal entries was admissible pursuant to Evidence\n\n\n\n\n      Further, when Smith did testify at trial, she did not offer the journal\nentries as prior consistent statements to support her trial testimony. Rather,\nthe only time that Smith sought admission of the journal entries was during\nDetective Smith\u2019s testimony to, as Smith states in her brief, \u201cimpeach [her]\nextrajudicial statements.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to admit evidence of the journal entries pursuant to\nEvidence Code section 1202, for the reasons stated in the text.\n\n15    Smith acknowledges in her brief that her extrajudicial statements to\nDr. Brauer during her medical appointments were \u201cadmissible as statements\nby a party opponent (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220) . . . .\u201d\n                                     19\n\fCode section 1202.16 The trial court thus did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding testimony pertaining to the journal entries.17\nB. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the uncharged\n   lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter because there is no\n   substantial evidence in the record to support the giving of the instruction\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury,\nsua sponte, on involuntary manslaughter as an uncharged lesser included\noffense to the charged offense of murder. Specifically, Smith contends that\nthe jury could have found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter based on\n\nher \u201ceither committing felony assault with a [deadly] weapon[18] or acting\nwith criminal negligence.\u201d\n      1. Standard of review\n      \u201cWe apply the independent or de novo standard of review to the failure\nby the trial court to instruct on an assertedly lesser included offense.\u201d\n(People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1158, 1218 (Cole).) In considering whether\nthe trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on lesser included\n\n\n16    In light of this conclusion, we need not consider the People\u2019s contention\nthat the trial court properly excluded the testimony because the journal\nentries had not been properly authenticated.\n\n17    In light of our conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin excluding the evidence, we further conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling did\nnot violate Smith\u2019s constitutional right to due process as the \u201cerroneous\nexclusion of critical corroborative defense evidence.\u201d (See, e.g., People v.\nRiccardi (2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 809 [\u201cThe routine and proper application of\nstate evidentiary law does not impinge on a defendant\u2019s due process rights\u201d].)\n\n18    Smith refers to the offense as \u201cassault with a weapon\u201d in one portion of\nher brief. However, in the modified CALCRIM No. 580 jury instruction that\nshe claims should have been given, Smith refers to the underlying offense as\nto which she claims an involuntary manslaughter instruction should have\nbeen given as \u201cassault with a deadly weapon.\u201d\n                                       20\n\foffenses, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nappellant. (People v. Turk (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1368.)\n      2. Governing law\n            a. A trial court\u2019s duty to instruct on lesser included offenses\n      \u201cA trial court must instruct the jury sua sponte on a lesser included\noffense only if there is substantial evidence, \u2018 \u201cthat is, evidence that a\nreasonable jury could find persuasive\u201d \u2019 [citation], which, if accepted, \u2018 \u201cwould\nabsolve [the] defendant from guilt of the greater offense\u201d [citation] but not the\nlesser.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Cole, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1218.) In other words,\n\u201c[s]uch instructions are required only where there is \u2018substantial evidence\u2019\nfrom which a rational jury could conclude that the defendant committed the\nlesser offense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense.\u201d (People v.\nDePriest (2007) 42 Cal.4th 1, 50.)\n            b.

The court began by outlining the elements of\nmurder, including the element of malice:\n         \u201cMurder is \u2018the unlawful killing of a human being, or a\n         fetus, with malice aforethought.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[M]alice may\n         be express or implied. It is express when there is\n         manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away\n         the life of a fellow creature.\u2019 [Citation.] It is implied when\n         the defendant engages in conduct dangerous to human life,\n         \u2018 \u201cknows that his conduct endangers the life of another\n         and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u201d \u2019\n         [Citation.]\u2019 (Id. at p. 30.)\n\n      The Brothers court explained that \u201cboth voluntary and involuntary\nmanslaughter are lesser included offenses of murder.\u201d (Brothers, supra,\n\n                                        21\n\f236 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.) After describing voluntary manslaughter, the\nBrothers court described involuntary manslaughter as follows:\n         \u201cInvoluntary manslaughter, in contrast, [is the] unlawful\n         killing of a human being without malice. (\u00a7 192.) It is\n         statutorily defined as a killing occurring during the\n         commission of \u2018an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony;\n         or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce\n         death, [accomplished] in an unlawful manner, or without\n         due caution and circumspection.\u2019 (\u00a7 192, subd. (b).)\n         Although the statutory language appears to exclude\n         killings committed in the course of a felony, the Supreme\n         Court has interpreted section 192 broadly to encompass an\n         unintentional killing in the course of a noninherently\n         dangerous felony committed without due caution or\n         circumspection.\u201d (Id. at p. 31.)\n\n      The Brothers court concluded that an instruction on \u201cinvoluntary\nmanslaughter as a lesser included offense must [also] be given when\na rational jury could entertain a reasonable doubt that an unlawful killing\nwas accomplished with implied malice during the course of an inherently\ndangerous assaultive felony.\u201d (Brothers, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 34,\nitalics added.)19\n\n\n\n\n19    The Brothers court reached this conclusion after first explaining that,\nordinarily, \u201cwhen [a] homicide occurs during the commission of an inherently\ndangerous felony, the homicide may be murder under the felony-murder rule,\nirrespective of the presence or absence of malice.\u201d (Brothers, supra,\n236 Cal.App.4th at p. 31, italics added.) However, the Brothers court noted\nthat, under the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d (id. at p. 31, fn. 5), when the underlying\nfelony is an assaultive crime, the assault merges with the homicide, and\napplication of the felony-murder rule is prohibited. (Id. at p. 31.) The\nBrothers court ultimately concluded that \u201can unjustified homicide in the\ncourse of an inherently dangerous assaultive felony (that is, a killing not\namounting to felony murder) and accomplished without malice is . . .\ninvoluntary manslaughter.\u201d (Id. at p. 32.)\n                                       22\n\f                  ii. Mental illness and malice\n      Prior to legislative changes adopted in 1981, a defendant was able to\npresent evidence that she lacked the capacity to form malice. (See People v.\nElmore (2014) 59 Cal.4th 121, 135 [\u201cDiminished capacity was a judicially\ncreated concept,\u201d that \u201callowed defendants to argue that because of mental\ninfirmity, they lacked \u2018awareness of the obligation to act within the general\nbody of laws regulating society,\u2019 and therefore were incapable of acting with\nmalice\u201d]; see id. at p. 138 [\u201cThe 1981 amendments make clear the Legislature\nintended to eliminate the notion of diminished capacity\u201d].)\n      In People v. McGehee (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1208 (McGehee), the\ncourt summarized the current state of the law pertaining to the relevance of\nevidence of a defendant\u2019s mental illness and malice:\n         \u201cWhile diminished capacity no longer mitigates an\n         intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter [citation], a\n         defendant \u2018is still free to show that because of his [or her]\n         mental illness or voluntary intoxication, he [or she] did not\n         in fact form the intent unlawfully to kill (i.e., did not have\n         malice aforethought). [Citation.] In a murder case, if this\n         evidence is believed, the only supportable verdict would be\n         involuntary manslaughter or an acquittal. If such a\n         showing gives rise to a reasonable doubt, the killing\n         (assuming there is no implied malice) can be no greater\n         than involuntary manslaughter.\u2019 ([Citation]; see also \u00a7 28,\n         subd. (a) [\u2018Evidence of mental disease, mental defect, or\n         mental disorder is admissible solely on the issue of whether\n         or not the accused actually formed a required specific\n         intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice\n         aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged\u2019].)\n\n         \u201cThus, in a murder case, instructions on involuntary\n         manslaughter are required where there is substantial\n         evidence that may come in the form of evidence of the\n         defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether\n         or not that defendant actually formed the intent to kill.\u201d\n         (Ibid.)\n\n                                      23\n\f                  iii. Assault with a deadly weapon\n      \u201c[A]ssault with a deadly weapon is a general intent crime; the required\nmens rea is \u2018an intentional act and actual knowledge of those facts sufficient\nto establish that the act by its nature will probably and directly result in the\napplication of physical force against another.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Perez (2018)\n4 Cal.5th 1055, 1066 (Perez).)\n      3. Application\n      As discussed in part III.B.2.a, ante, it is well established under\nCalifornia law that in order for a trial court to have a sua sponte duty to\ninstruct on a lesser included offense, there must be \u201c \u2018evidence from which a\njury composed of reasonable persons could conclude \u201cthat the lesser offense,\nbut not the greater, was committed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Wilson (2021) 11 Cal.5th\n259, 298 (Wilson).) Thus, in order for Smith to prevail on her claim that the\ntrial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on involuntary\nmanslaughter based on her commission of an assault with a deadly weapon,\nthere must be evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Smith\ncommitted an assault-based involuntary manslaughter, but not murder based\non express or implied malice. Our review of the evidence presented during\nthe guilt phase reveals no such evidence.\n      With respect to her commission of the homicide, Smith testified that,\njust before the killing, the victim made several comments that Smith\nconsidered to be demeaning. Smith became emotional and picked up a\nhammer. According to Smith, the victim attempted to take the hammer away\nfrom Smith. After a physical struggle, Smith described the events that\nensued:\n          \u201cAnd I still had the hammer in my hand, and she was to my\n          left, and I was right next to her. And I hit her with a\n          hammer in the head, and I remember hitting her four\n                                       24\n\f         times, all in a row, like really fast, and it was like a dream.\n         And I heard the sound, it was her skull cracking. And then\n         I could feel something that it felt like I hit, like, Jello. And\n         something about that, like, snapped me back into, like,\n         what was going on. And I looked down at my mom, and she\n         was bleeding and her head was -- was wounded, and I\n         suddenly realized that I had done this and I started saying,\n         \u2018Mommy, oh my God, Mommy, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 \u201d\n\n      In light of this testimony, we assume for purposes of this opinion that\nthe jury could have found that Smith was in a dream-like state at the time of\nthe killing and lacked express or implied malice while repeatedly striking the\nvictim in the head with a hammer. However, if the jury so found, the jury\ncould not also have found that Smith, while acting in a dream-like state, had\n\nthe intent to commit an assault with a deadly weapon.20 Specifically, a jury\nthat found that Smith was in a dream-like state and without malice while\nhitting her mother in the head with a hammer could not also have found that,\nat the same time, Smith committed an \u201c \u2018intentional act [with] actual\nknowledge of those facts sufficient to establish that the act by its nature will\nprobably and directly result in the application of physical force against\nanother.\u2019 \u201d (Perez, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 1066, italics added.) That is because\nthere is no evidence in the record from which the jury could reasonably find\nthat Smith, while acting in a dream-like state, was, at the same time, acting\n\n\n\n\n20     In her brief on appeal, Smith asserts, without citation to any evidence\nin the record, that \u201c[w]hile she had the intent to assault, it was not so clear in\nlight of her mental illness, she had malice or the intent to kill.\u201d (Italics\nadded.) As discussed in the text, our review of the record reveals no evidence\nupon which a trier of fact could find that she lacked malice but \u201chad the\nintent to assault.\u201d\n\n                                        25\n\fintentionally.21 Further, because the commission of an assault requires an\nintentional act, a reasonable jury could not find that Smith was in a dream-\nlike state and also find that she was acting in an intentional manner\nsufficient to commit an assault. Because there was no evidence that would\nhave supported a conclusion that Smith committed the lesser offense of an\nassault-based involuntary manslaughter, but not the greater offense of\nmurder, no lesser included offense instruction on involuntary manslaughter\nwas warranted. In short, Smith either committed murder, voluntary\nmanslaughter,22 or no offense at all.\n      We acknowledge that there are broad statements in case law\nsuggesting that, when a defendant is charged with murder, an instruction on\ninvoluntary manslaughter is required whenever the jury could find that the\ndefendant lacked an intent to kill. (See McGehee, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1208 [\u201c[I]n a murder case, instructions on involuntary manslaughter are\nrequired where there is substantial evidence that may come in the form of\nevidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether or\n\n\n21    At oral argument, Smith\u2019s counsel argued that, although Smith knew\nthat she was hitting her mother in the head repeatedly with a hammer and\nthus had the intent to commit an assault, because of her mental illness and\nemotional state, she did not appreciate the dangerousness of such act.\nHowever, we see no evidence in the record, including Smith\u2019s testimony\nrecounted above, from which a reasonable jury could make such a finding.\nStated differently, there is no evidence that any dissociative state under\nwhich Smith was acting at the time of the offense operated in this peculiar\nmanner, i.e., there is no evidence that Smith\u2019s mental state was such that\nthat she maintained an understanding that she was hitting her mother in the\nhead repeatedly with a hammer, but lacked sufficient cognition to \u201c \u2018 \u201cknow[ ]\nthat [her] conduct endanger[ed] the life of another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Brothers, supra,\n236 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.)\n\n22    The trial court instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter based on\nheat of passion.\n                                       26\n\fnot that defendant actually formed the intent to kill\u201d]; People v. Rogers (2006)\n39 Cal.4th 826, 884 (Rogers) [\u201cAn instruction on involuntary manslaughter is\nrequired whenever there is substantial evidence indicating the defendant did\n\nnot actually form the intent to kill\u201d].)23 However, we understand the law to\nbe that, in order for a trial court to have a sua sponte duty to instruct on\ninvoluntary manslaughter, there must be substantial evidence from which\nthe jury could find that the defendant lacked express or implied malice, but\ncommitted the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. (People v.\nAbilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 515 [\u201c \u2018If the evidence presents a material issue\nof whether a killing was committed without malice, and if there is substantial\nevidence the defendant committed involuntary manslaughter, failing to\ninstruct on involuntary manslaughter would violate the defendant\u2019s\nconstitutional right to have the jury determine every material issue\u2019 \u201d].) To\nconclude that an involuntary manslaughter instruction is required in every\ncase in which a jury could find that a defendant committed a killing but\nlacked malice would do away with the bedrock principle that an uncharged\nlesser included offense instruction is required only if there is substantial\nevidence upon which a jury could find both that the defendant did not commit\nthe greater offense, but did commit the lesser. (See, e.g., Wilson, supra,\n11 Cal.5th at p. 298.) We aware of no authority that would support such a\nconclusion and decline to reach it here.\n\n\n\n\n23    The formulations in McGehee and Rogers also should not be read to\nsuggest that murder requires proof an \u201cintent to kill,\u201d (McGehee, supra,\n246 Cal.App.4th 1208; Rogers, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 884), since implied\nmalice murder does not require proof of such intent. (See, e.g., People v.\nFontenot (2019) 8 Cal.5th 57, 80 [\u201cmurder . . . requires an act causing the\ndeath of another, but not the intent to kill, as implied malice will suffice\u201d];\nPeople v. Gonzalez (2012) 54 Cal.4th 643, 653 [same].)\n                                       27\n\f      We also are not persuaded by Smith\u2019s contention that there was\nsubstantial evidence supporting an involuntary manslaughter instruction\nbased on her having acted with criminal negligence. (Citing People v. Glenn\n(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1461.) In Glenn, the Court of Appeal concluded that\nan involuntary manslaughter instruction was required because \u201c[p]art of [the\ndefendant\u2019s] testimony suggests the stabbing [that resulted in a homicide]\nwas accidental.\u201d (Id. at p. 1465.) The testimony from which the Court of\nAppeal reached this conclusion was the following:\n         \u201cGlenn [the defendant] testified he removed the knife from\n         his waistband and placed it in his lap while he sat at the\n         counter. When he got up from the counter and started\n         walking toward the door he tried, at the same time, to put\n         the knife back in his pants. As he was walking and trying\n         to slip the foot-long knife back into his pants he heard the\n         victim coming up behind him. The victim appeared about\n         to grab Glenn and, in a reflex action, Glenn turned with the\n         knife in his hand and the knife entered the victim\u2019s chest\n         causing a fatal wound. Glenn stated, \u2018I didn\u2019t try to stick it.\n         It\u2019s just that when he turned--when I turned and he is\n         coming, and it just happened like at the same time.\u2019 \u201d (Id.\n         at pp. 1465\u20131466.)\n\n      There was no comparable evidence in this case from which a jury could\nhave reasonably found that Smith\u2019s acts in striking the victim in the head\nrepeatedly with a hammer was accidental.\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to\ninstruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter,\nbecause there is no substantial evidence to support the giving of the\n\ninstruction.24\n\n\n\n24    In the alternative, Smith argues that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance in failing to request an instruction on involuntary\nmanslaughter. Given our conclusion that there is no substantial evidence to\n                                        28\n\fC. Smith is not entitled to reversal of the guilt phase verdict pursuant to the\n   cumulative error doctrine\n\n      Smith contends that the cumulative effect of the errors that she alleges\noccurred during the guilt phase requires reversal of the guilt-phase verdict.\n\u201cUnder the \u2018cumulative error\u2019 doctrine, errors that are individually harmless\nmay nevertheless have a cumulative effect that is prejudicial.\u201d (In re Avena\n(1996) 12 Cal.4th 694, 772, fn. 32.) We have found no errors to cumulate.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the cumulative error doctrine does not require\nreversal of the guilt-phase verdict.\nD. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence during the sanity\n   phase of the trial that Smith had not described being in a state of\n   depersonalization or derealization prior to her evaluation with\n   Dr. Stewart\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in admitting evidence during\nthe sanity phase that Smith had not described being in a state of\ndepersonalization or derealization prior to her evaluation with Dr. Stewart.\nShe contends that the evidence was inadmissible as violative of her\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle, supra, 426 U.S. 610 and its\nprogeny because it amounted to a comment on her exercise of her right to\nremain silent after having been advised of her rights under Miranda, supra,\n384 U.S. 436.\n\n\n\n\nsupport the giving of an involuntary manslaughter instruction, we reject\nSmith\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. (See People v. Szadziewicz (2008)\n161 Cal.App.4th 823, 836 [\u201cDefense counsel\u2019s failure to request instructions\non unreasonable self-defense and lesser included offenses based on that\ntheory did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d because\ninstructions were not supported by the evidence or the law and \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s\nfailure to make a futile or unmeritorious motion or request is not ineffective\nassistance\u201d (italics omitted)].)\n                                       29\n\f      We assume for purposes of this decision that the de novo standard of\nreview applies in determining whether the trial court violated Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle. (See People v. Seijas (2005)\n36 Cal.4th 291, 304 [\u201cindependent review \u2018comports with this court\u2019s usual\npractice for review of mixed question determinations affecting constitutional\n\nrights\u2019 \u201d].)25\n      1. Factual and procedural background\n             a. Pretrial and guilt phase background\n      Prior to the trial, in a motion in limine, the People stated that they\nintended to offer in evidence Smith\u2019s statements to the 9-1-1 operator and to\na police officer immediately after her arrest. However, the People indicated\nthat they did not intend to introduce in evidence during their case in chief\n\n\n\n25     Smith also contends that \u201c[a]t the very least, the evidence should have\nbeen excluded under Evidence Code section 352.\u201d She also appears to\ncontend that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence because it was\nirrelevant. Smith did not assert Evidence Code section 352 or relevancy\nobjections in the trial court and as a result, her appellate claims on these\ngrounds are forfeited. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 353 [providing in part that a\n\u201cverdict or finding shall not be set aside, nor shall the judgment or decision\nbased thereon be reversed, by reason of the erroneous admission of evidence\nunless: [\u00b6] (a) There appears of record an objection to or a motion to exclude\nor to strike the evidence that was timely made and so stated as to make clear\nthe specific ground of the objection or motion\u201d].)\n       Smith also broadly asserts that trial counsel was \u201cineffective to the\nextent she failed to make a proper objection or motion,\u201d (capitalization\nomitted) but fails to present any argument that trial counsel\u2019s failure to make\nan Evidence Code section 352 or relevancy objection amounted to ineffective\nassistance. Accordingly, this line of argument is forfeited as well. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Harper (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1419, fn. 4 [\u201can argument\nraised in . . . perfunctory fashion is waived\u201d].) Accordingly, we address in the\ntext the claim that Smith properly preserved in the trial court and on appeal,\ni.e., her claim of Doyle error.\n\n                                       30\n\fSmith\u2019s interview at the police station shortly after she was arrested because\nthe interview contained statements that Smith made after invoking her right\nto counsel.\n\n      During the guilt phase of the trial,26 the People introduced in evidence\na recording of Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call and statements that she made to a police\nofficer in a patrol car immediately after her arrest.\n              b. Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony on direct examination during the\n                 sanity phase\n\n      During direct examination in the sanity phase of the trial, Dr. Stewart\ndescribed to the jury the documents that he reviewed in preparing for his\npsychiatric evaluation of Smith:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. Now, in this case, you were hired\n         to conduct the psychiatric evaluation of Ms. Smith. What\n         documents did you review in preparation for that\n         evaluation?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Police reports, medical records, including\n         the 20-plus years that she was in treatment with\n         Dr. Brauer, the Santa Clara County Jail medical and\n         psychiatric records.\u201d\n\n      Dr Stewart also extensively discussed Smith\u2019s jail records, which\ndocumented that Smith had been placed on a psychiatric hold while in jail\nawaiting trial.\n      Dr. Stewart also testified, \u201cI\u2019m convinced that [Smith] was in a period\nof depersonalization at the time of the crime.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n26   The parties stipulated that the jury could consider all evidence offered\nduring the guilt phase in the sanity phase.\n                                      31\n\f            c. The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart and the\n               defense\u2019s Doyle objection\n\n      The prosecutor asked Dr. Stewart whether he had asked Smith \u201cabout\ndeliberation,\u201d and what Smith had said in response. Dr. Stewart responded:\n         \u201cI asked her if she had planned to kill her mother and she\n         said no, she was in this dream-like state where she didn\u2019t\n         have control over her mental processes or control of her\n         body, and had a hammer in her hand and then she was in\n         this state, observing herself hitting her mother and that\n         during the course of the hitting, she -- as she has testified\n         to and as she told me, she said she snapped out of it when\n         she felt the hammer going into her mother\u2019s head. That\u2019s\n         what she said.\u201d\n\n      Shortly thereafter, the following colloquy occurred during which the\ntrial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s Doyle objections:\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] All right. Now, you talked to [Smith] in\n         May of 2017; is that correct, thereabouts?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] September of \u201916.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. But your report was May of 2017?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Correct.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. So you talked to her in\n         September?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] And January of \u201917.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] January of \u201917. Okay. Was that the first\n         time, to your knowledge, that [Smith] mentioned this idea\n         of depersonalization and derealization?\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection, Your Honor. Doyle error.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Overruled.\n\n\n                                       32\n\f         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] She never mentioned depersonalization or\n         derealization.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] She didn\u2019t use those words because that\u2019s\n         not in her vocabulary, but was that the first time, to your\n         knowledge -- and granted, this jury already knows that you\n         reviewed all the jail records and you reviewed all the police\n         records and so you reviewed all the statements of everyone\n         concerned, okay -- was that the first time that she\n         mentioned, when you met with her, this idea of being\n         outside of herself or being in a car or not acting within\n         herself?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Same objection, Your Honor.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Overruled.\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] In my review of the police records, I don\u2019t\n         remember her describing that exact -- using those exact\n         terms of being in a dream state. I believe she said she got\n         in an argument with her mother and ended up hitting her\n         with a hammer. But to answer your question, I\u2019m unaware\n         of if [or] when she told me that, that that was the first time.\n         She may have said it to someone else that I\u2019m not aware\n         of.\u201d\n\n      Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor asked Dr. Stewart whether\nSmith had suggested having been in a state of derealization at the time of the\noffense during either the 9-1-1 call or during her conversation with a\ndetective immediately after her arrest:\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] All right. You heard the 9-1-1 call in this\n         case --\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] -- as part of the materials that were\n         provided to you?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n                                       33\n\f\u201c[The prosecutor:] She doesn\u2019t mention in that call any sort\nof comments that would lead you to believe that she was in\na state of derealization; right?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] In the call, no.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. And you\u2019ve heard also the patrol -\n- we\u2019re calling it an interview, but there\u2019s a colloquy\nbetween her and one of the detectives in the patrol car\nimmediately after the arrest. Do you know what I\u2019m\ntalking about?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] I believe she voluntary says something\nabout killing her mother.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] They said, \u2018It\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 and she\nsaid, \u2018It\u2019s not okay. I killed my mother.\u2019 Do you remember\nthat?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] And there\u2019s no mention there of any sort\nof being outside of a body or anything of that sort; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Correct.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] You would agree that those statements\ncame much closer in time to the murder than your\nconversation with her; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Absolutely.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] So at the time, the events would have\nbeen fresh in her mind; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Well, it certainly was closer in time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f            d. The discussion of Smith\u2019s Doyle objection among the court and\n               counsel outside the presence of the jury\n\n      During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart, the trial\ncourt excused the jury for a recess. During the recess, the following\ndiscussion of Smith\u2019s Doyle objection occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] I do want to put my objection on the\n         record in regards to questioning of Dr. Stewart about the\n         fact that the first time my client made statements\n         regarding the offense, that went to depersonalization and\n         derealization was when Dr. Stewart talked to her, I believe.\n         It\u2019s an error on the prosecution\u2019s part to ask questions\n         regarding her assertion of her Fifth Amendment right to\n         remain silent and not talk to the police at the time of the\n         incident, and so asking questions that are posed in that\n         manner opens the door now to, unfortunately, the Defense\n         might having to go into that area.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Your Honor, I do not specifically recall --\n         I don\u2019t believe there is a mention in that -- and I know that\n         Counsel\u2019s referring to the questioning of the defendant by\n         Detective [DiGiovanna], in which she invoked and which\n         the People agreed we were not going to use. I don\u2019t believe\n         that she says anything about depersonalization or\n         derealization in that conversation. But in any event, I\n         certainly was not referring to that at all. I was specifically\n         referring to the statements that had been admitted here in\n         court which include the 9-1-1 call and the patrol [car]\n         questioning, as well as the defendant\u2019s own testimony. I\n         was not making any reference at all to that particular piece\n         of evidence.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, I think posing questions\n         such as, \u2018This is the first time that Ms. Smith made\n         statements to you in regards to being in a dream-like state,\u2019\n         you know, \u2018not having control of her mental processes,\u2019 that\n         line of questioning, I think, is improper, given the fact that\n         she invoked with the police. I think if those questions were\n                                      35\n\f-- if she was interviewed by the police and those questions\nwere posed of her and she hadn\u2019t invoked then, she might\nhave made those statements. But the fact that she\ninvoked --\n\n\u201c[The court:] No. I understand your objection. [Dr. Stewart]\nsaid that he looked at the police reports. Did the police\nreports contain the statement that is not -- that the People\nhave indicated they\u2019re not using, the one that was made\nwhere she did invoke?\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] Yes. There is, I think, a summary by\nDetective [DiGiovanna] in there.\n\n\u201c[The court:] Okay. So [Dr. Stewart] looked in there. And\nmy recollection is that he didn\u2019t see any mention of these\nstatements in the police reports or in the 9-1-1 call or her\ntestimony, or -- but he specifically said he did not -- he says,\n\u2018I don\u2019t remember them in these other things, but I don\u2019t\nknow whether or not she has ever made those statements\nbefore.\u2019\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, I think making any\ncomment on a person\u2019s invocation of their Fifth\nAmendment right, the fact that she previously didn\u2019t make\na statement when they have invoked, is error. Whether\nthey made any kind of statement during that limited\ninterview by Detective [DiGiovanna], just the reference to\nit, I believe, is error, and that was the basis for both my\nobjections during the time of questioning.\n\n\u201c[The court:] And I overruled it.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Yes.\n\n\u201c[The court:] Okay. I still think they should be overruled.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\f             e. Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony\n      Dr. Mohandie testified that the first time Smith described being in a\nstate of depersonalization or derealization was several months after the\n\noffense.27\n      During defense counsel\u2019s cross examination of Dr. Mohandie, the\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Do you have any evidence in the\n         discovery that you\u2019ve received indicating that [Smith]\n         checked out some books on mental disorders, specifically\n         depersonalization or derealization or any other mental\n         disorders?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] I don\u2019t know anything about that, no.\n\n\n27    Although not material to Smith\u2019s claim, there is some ambiguity in the\nrecord as to the amount of time that Dr. Mohandie stated had passed from\nthe commission of the offense to Smith\u2019s first disclosure of dissociation.\nDuring direct examination, the prosecutor asked Dr. Mohandie to discuss\ninconsistencies between \u201cinformation that you learned versus the\ninvestigative documents . . . .\u201d Dr. Mohandie responded:\n         \u201cRight. Well, basically, the 9-1-1 call in particular, there\u2019s\n         a very clear discussion, in my opinion, of a statement, if you\n         will, by Ms. Smith about what happened. There was no\n         evidence whatsoever of any kind of dissociative experience\n         or depersonalization, which is what she\u2019s going to say later,\n         the first time nearly three months later, and certainly in the\n         interview with me on May 2nd of this year; so that\u2019s a very\n         significant inconsistency, that particular fact.\n         \u201cAnd there\u2019s no behavioral evidence of it during that 9-1-1\n         call, no references to anything that would be like that;\n         rather, it was quite the opposite, sort of lucid, it was very\n         present, it was very emotion-laden, which is not what you\n         would see.\u201d (Italics added.)\n       However, on cross-examination, Dr. Mohandie indicated that Smith\u2019s\nfirst disclosure had occurred a \u201cyear and three months,\u201d after the offense.\n(Italics added.)\n                                       37\n\f\u201c[Defense counsel:] So you don\u2019t have any basis for your\nclaim that you think she made this up afterwards?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] Well, the basis is -- I do have a basis. The\nbasis is that she\u2019s reporting a disorder that is not\nrealistically being reported in terms of how these things\nhappen, that is inconsistent with the behavioral and\nemotional evidence, as I see it, and that there was no\ncontemporaneous -- that is at the time or around the time --\nevidence of it, and it doesn\u2019t appear until the year and\nthree months later. That is the basis of my finding.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] And you\u2019re aware that that\u2019s the first\ntime that she speaks to a psychiatrist; is that correct, about\nher case?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] It may be.\n\n\u201c[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. And when she\u2019s arrested and she\nis charged with a crime and provided an attorney, at that\npoint, she\u2019s not allowed to be interviewed, is that fair to\nsay, without the consent of her attorney?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] You mean after she invoked?\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] If an individual is arrested, charged\nwith a crime, and given an attorney, no one is allowed to\ninterview her at that point; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] True.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] And so between that time and the time\nthat Dr. Stewart met with her, there was no opportunity for\nher to provide a statement to anyone except her attorney; is\nthat correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] In terms of an official statement, sure.\nAgreed.\u201d\n\n                              38\n\f            f. Smith\u2019s request for a pinpoint instruction and motion for a\n               mistrial\n\n      During a hearing outside the presence of the jury the following day, the\ntrial court indicated that defense counsel had stated in chambers that she\nbelieved that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith having invoked her right to\ncounsel was a violation of a court order because, just prior to having made\nthat statement, Dr. Mohandie had been admonished by counsel outside the\npresence of the jury not to refer to Smith\u2019s statements to the police after she\n\nhad invoked her right to counsel.28 Defense counsel stated the following:\n         \u201cI\u2019m asking the Court specifically for a pinpoint instruction\n         indicating that the witness for the prosecution intentionally\n         violated instructions from the judge. I didn\u2019t indicate \u2018court\n         order,\u2019 and that was the instructions you gave us in the\n         hallway to go outside, talk to him, let him know not to\n\n28    Specifically, the trial court stated that defense counsel believed that\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith\u2019s invocation violated a court order as\nfollows:\n         \u201cYou believe that that was a violation of a court order\n         because prior to that time, we had a discussion in the\n         hallway where we reaffirmed that the statements that\n         Ms. Smith made to police officers at the police station, not\n         the one that was referred to in the car at the scene, but\n         those statements were potentially a violation of Miranda.\n         We didn\u2019t really necessarily get to that because both\n         counsel agreed that the [prosecutor] agreed he was not\n         going to try and introduce that. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] So I don\u2019t know\n         that there was a specific ruling on it, but I\u2019m satisfied that\n         both the parties believe that it was a violation of Miranda.\n         And we reaffirmed in the hallway that he would not refer to\n         that, and then I came out, told [Dr. Mohandie] to go out\n         into the hallway with counsel, and I wasn\u2019t present, but\n         apparently that was told to [Dr. Mohandie], and then he\n         came back and it was after that that [Dr. Mohandie] made\n         this statement,\u201d about Smith invoking.\n                                       39\n\f         discuss anything in regards to the statements that\n         Ms. Smith made to the police because it was a violation of\n         her right when she invoked.\n\n         \u201cI also asked the Court to -- well, let me read the statement\n         in its entirety. \u2018The witness for the prosecution\n         intentionally violated instructions from the judge. You can\n         consider that fact when evaluating what weight to give to\n         this witness\u2019s credibility and testimony in this case. And,\n         furthermore, you should not consider any evidence\n         regarding Linde Smith\u2019s timing of her disclosures of\n         depersonalization and derealization episode.\u2019\n\n         \u201cAnd in regards to the last point, Your Honor, we\u2019ve had\n         multiple conversations regarding statements that have\n         been made -- or questions that have been asked in cross-\n         examination of my witnesses as well as statements made\n         by the prosecution witness that her -- Linde Smith\u2019s\n         reported symptoms regarding depersonalization and\n         derealization were actually a year and three months later,\n         and therefore, they\u2019re suspect. I believe, as I had\n         previously indicated to the Court, that that was a Doyle\n         error, and it is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n         due process rights of my client, as well as the Doyle case,\n         426 U.S. 610.\n\n         \u201cI am requesting that the Court consider a mistrial, given\n         the fact that Dr. Mohandie made a statement regarding\n         invocation, and made several statements regarding the fact\n         that Linde Smith disclosed the statement a year and three\n         months later when she had, in fact, invoked her right to\n         remain silent.\u201d\n\n      The prosecutor objected to the giving of the instruction and argued that\nthere had been no Doyle violation. After further discussion from the\nprosecutor and the defense, the trial court ruled as follows:\n         \u201cAll right. Couple things. No. 1, with regard to the request\n         for a pinpoint instruction, and that instruction which is\n         Court Exhibit 1, I denied it as written, and for [a] number\n         of reasons, one of which being that I do not believe that I\n                                       40\n\f         have sufficient proof that the witness intentionally violated\n         an instruction from the judge.\n\n         \u201cAlso, the instruction says that you should not consider any\n         evidence regarding Linde Smith\u2019s timing of her disclosures\n         of depersonalization and derealization episode as part of\n         that instruction, and I think that\u2019s contrary to the evidence\n         and goes far beyond what he said.\n\n         \u201cI did propose that I would read the following, quote, \u2018When\n         Dr. Mohandie, in response to a question by defense counsel,\n         asked, quote, \u201cyou mean after she invoked,\u201d end quote, that\n         comment was an improper reference to the defendant\u2019s\n         actions and contrary to an agreement by the parties after a\n         discussion with the Court. You may not consider, for any\n         purpose, whether the defendant invoked any right, and you\n         may not consider the doctor\u2019s comment for any reason.\u2019\n\n         \u201cCounsel opted not to allow that -- or not to have that read\n         to the jury.\u201d\n\n      Defense counsel responded that the reason she had rejected the trial\ncourt\u2019s offer to provide its proposed instruction was that the court\u2019s proposed\ninstruction highlighted the issue of invocation, while the defense\u2019s proposed\ninstruction was \u201cmore vague.\u201d\n      The court interjected:\n         \u201cThat\u2019s fine. That was another reason for denying the\n         pinpoint instruction[,] the fact that it has no context. It\n         simply says, \u2018The witness for the prosecution intentionally\n         violated instructions from the judge.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t tell the jury\n         what particular instructions of the Court were violated, and\n         I think that is misleading as well.\u201d\n\n      The court also denied the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial.\n            g. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\n      During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor argued that it\nwas important for the jury to view Smith\u2019s interview with Dr. Mohandie in\n\n                                       41\n\fpart because \u201cit shows [the jury] the progression of her made-up story, okay?\u201d\nThe prosecutor continued:\n         \u201cWhen [Smith] first tells 9-1-1 what happened, she hasn\u2019t\n         yet thought of this idea of being outside a car and not being\n         in her own body, okay? She only adds that later when she\n         meets Dr. Stewart, okay?\n\n         \u201cBy the time the defendant got to court here and testified\n         before you, the day that she was examined and was cross-\n         examined by me, the story was complete. All the parts\n         were there.\u201d\n\n      2. Governing law\n       In Doyle, supra, 426 U.S. 610, the United States Supreme Court held\nthat \u201cthe use against defendant of a postarrest invocation of rights following\na Miranda admonition violates due process.\u201d (People v. Thomas (2012)\n54 Cal.4th 908, 936, citing Doyle, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 619.) The Doyle court\nreasoned, \u201c[W]hile it is true that the Miranda warnings contain no express\nassurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any\nperson who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be\nfundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested\nperson\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at\ntrial.\u201d (Doyle, supra, at p. 618.)\n      In Wainwright v. Greenfield (1986) 474 U.S. 284, the United States\nSupreme Court extended Doyle and held that the prosecution\u2019s use of the\ndefendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence to demonstrate a defendant\u2019s sanity is\nimproper. (Id. at p. 292.) In Wainwright, two police officers testified that\nshortly after his arrest, the defendant had twice exercised his right to remain\nsilent and his desire to consult with counsel before answering any questions.\n(Id. at pp. 286\u2013287.) During closing argument, \u201cthe prosecutor reviewed the\ntestimony of [the officers] and suggested that [defendant\u2019s] repeated refusals\n\n                                      42\n\fto answer questions without first consulting an attorney demonstrated a\ndegree of comprehension that was inconsistent with his claim of insanity.\u201d\n(Id at p. 287.) The Wainwright court held that this testimony and argument\nwas improper under Doyle, reasoning:\n         \u201cThe point of the Doyle holding is that it is fundamentally\n         unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will\n         not be used against him and thereafter to breach that\n         promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.\n         It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence\n         to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity.\u201d (Wainwright,\n         supra, at p. 292.)\n\n      \u201cBut this does not mean that it always is error to permit evidence that\na defendant exercised his right to counsel.\u201d (People v. Huggins (2006)\n38 Cal.4th 175, 198.) \u201cTo establish a violation of due process under Doyle, the\ndefendant must show that the prosecution inappropriately used his\npostarrest silence for impeachment purposes and the trial court permitted\nthe prosecution to engage in such inquiry or argument. [Citations.] . . . An\nassessment of whether the prosecutor made inappropriate use of defendant\u2019s\npostarrest silence requires consideration of the context of the prosecutor\u2019s\ninquiry or argument. [Citation.] A violation of due process does not occur\nwhere the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s postarrest silence constitutes\na fair response to defendant\u2019s claim or a fair comment on the evidence.\n[Citations.] \u2018 . . . Doyle\u2019s protection of the right to remain silent is a \u201cshield,\u201d\nnot a \u201csword\u201d that can be used to \u201ccut off the prosecution\u2019s \u2018fair response\u2019 to\nthe evidence or argument of the defendant.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d (People v.\nChampion (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1448 (Champion).)\n      In addition, a prosecutor does not violate Doyle by inquiring about prior\nvoluntary statements that a defendant has made. (Anderson v. Charles\n(1980) 447 U.S. 404, 409 (Anderson) [where \u201cquestions were not designed to\n\n                                         43\n\fdraw meaning from silence, but to elicit an explanation for a prior\ninconsistent statement,\u201d Doyle is not violated].) As the Anderson court\nexplained:\n         \u201cDoyle bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence\n         maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. But\n         Doyle does not apply to cross-examination that merely\n         inquires into prior inconsistent statements. . . . As to the\n         subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not\n         remained silent at all.\u201d (Anderson, supra, at p. 408.)\n\n      3. Application\n      Smith argues, \u201cIn violation of Doyle, the prosecution\u2019s questions and\nthe resulting testimony, as well as Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony, suggested that\n[Smith\u2019s] claim of depersonalization or derealization was fabricated because\nshe did not mention it after invoking her right to silence under the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments,\u201d until speaking with mental health experts more\nthan a year after the offense. We are not persuaded.\n      We first consider the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart.\nDr. Stewart testified on direct examination that he relied on \u201c[p]olice\nreports . . . [and] the Santa Clara County Jail medical and psychiatric\nrecords,\u201d in conducting his psychiatric evaluation of Smith. Dr. Stewart also\ntestified at length about the content of Smith\u2019s jail psychiatric records. Given\nDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony that he relied on \u201cpolice reports,\u201d and \u201cjail records,\u201d it\nwas not Doyle error for the prosecutor to ask Dr. Stewart whether there were\nany statements in the \u201cjail records\u201d and \u201cpolice reports\u201d indicating that Smith\nhad referenced \u201cthis idea of being outside of herself or being in a car or not\nacting within herself.\u201d Doyle is based on the idea that it is \u201cfundamentally\nunfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence\nto be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d (Doyle,\nsupra, 426 U.S. at p. 618.) However, the fundamental fairness concerns\n\n                                       44\n\fanimating Doyle and its progeny do not prohibit a prosecutor from cross-\nexamining a defense expert about whether there are statements to support\nhis opinion in the documents on which the defense expert has expressly\nstated that he relied. To conclude otherwise would be to allow the defendant\nto use \u201c \u2018the right to remain silent . . . [as] a \u201csword\u201d . . . to \u201ccut off the\nprosecution\u2019s \u2018fair response\u2019 to the evidence or argument of the defendant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Champion, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1448.) Doyle is not to be applied in\nsuch an instance.\n      This is particularly so given that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not\nmake any specific reference to the police interview during which Smith\n\napparently invoked her right to remain silent.29 Instead, and in considering\nthe \u201ccontext of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry\u201d (Champion, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1448), we note that the specific statements of Smith that the prosecutor\ndid reference were Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call and her conversation with a detective\nimmediately after her arrest. The prosecutor did not violate Doyle by asking\nDr. Stewart whether Smith had mentioned depersonalization when making\nthese statements. (See Anderson, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 408 [\u201cDoyle does not\napply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent\nstatements\u201d].)\n      Similarly, the gist of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s\nclosing argument that Smith references on appeal was that Smith\u2019s claim of\ndepersonalization lacked believability because her claim was inconsistent\nwith voluntary statements that she made near the time of the offense. (See\npt. III.D.1.e. and pt. III.D.1.g, ante.) For example, Dr. Mohandie noted that\nthere was \u201cno evidence whatsoever of any kind of dissociative experience or\ndepersonalization,\u201d in Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call. Similarly, during his closing\n\n\n29    A transcript of the interview is not in the record.\n                                       45\n\fargument, the prosecutor argued that when Smith \u201cfirst tells 9-1-1 what\nhappened, she hasn\u2019t yet thought of this idea of being outside a car and not\nbeing in her own body,\u201d and that Smith \u201conly adds that later when she meets\nDr. Stewart . . . .\u201d Arguing such inconsistencies does not constitute Doyle\nerror. (See Anderson, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 408.) Further, neither\nDr. Mohandie nor the prosecutor ever stated or suggested that Smith\u2019s\ntestimony was unbelievable because she had invoked her right to remain\nsilent during a police interview.\n      In addition, Dr. Mohandie\u2019s mention of Smith\u2019s invocation of her\nMiranda rights during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination did not constitute\nDoyle error or warrant the granting of a mistrial. While defense counsel\nargued that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s reference constituted an intentional violation of\nthe trial court\u2019s instructions, the record does not contain the precise\nadmonishment that Dr. Mohandie received prior to providing this testimony.\n(See fn. 28, ante.) Further, the trial court could have reasonably found that\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith\u2019s invocation reflected a good faith attempt\n\nto answer defense counsel\u2019s question.30 In sum, the trial court reasonably\ndetermined that it lacked \u201csufficient proof that the witness intentionally\nviolated an instruction from the judge.\u201d Further, the trial court\u2019s offer to\nprovide an admonishment to the jury was a reasonable approach to cure any\npotential prejudice from Dr. Mohandie\u2019s statement. And, while defense\n\n\n30    As noted in part III.D.1.e, ante, Dr. Mohandie referenced Smith\u2019s\ninvocation of her Miranda rights during the following colloquy:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. And when she\u2019s arrested and she\n         is charged with a crime and provided an attorney, at that\n         point, she\u2019s not allowed to be interviewed, is that fair to\n         say, without the consent of her attorney?\n         \u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] You mean after she invoked?\u201d\n                                    46\n\fcounsel acted reasonably in making the tactical decision to decline the trial\ncourt\u2019s offer to provide such admonishment, the trial court was not obligated\nto grant a mistrial based on Dr. Mohandie\u2019s mere mention of Smith\u2019s having\n\u201cinvoked.\u201d This is particularly true given that Dr. Mohandie agreed with\ndefense counsel that Smith had not had an opportunity to make an \u201cofficial\nstatement\u201d between the time she was provided with an attorney and the time\nthat Dr. Stewart interviewed her. Finally, the trial court provided a reasoned\nexplanation for denying defense counsel\u2019s requested pinpoint instruction, i.e.,\nthe instruction was vague and unsupported by the evidence.\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not violate Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle and its progeny.\nE. The trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate Smith\u2019s\n   constitutional rights by refusing to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\n   during the sanity phase due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\n   provide the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court abused its discretion and violated her\nconstitutional rights in denying her request to preclude Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying during the sanity phase due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nprovide the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data.\n      A trial court\u2019s discovery rulings, including its resolution of claims\npertaining to the prosecution\u2019s alleged failure to timely comply with its\ndiscovery obligations, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. (People v. Mora\nand Rangel (2018) 5 Cal.5th 442, 466 (Mora and Rangel).) We review Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional claims de novo. (See People v. Salazar (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1031,\n1042 [Brady claim is reviewed de novo]; People v. Cromer (2001) 24 Cal.4th\n889, 901 [reviewing courts ordinarily apply independent review of\nconstitutional claims involving mixed questions of fact and law].)\n\n\n\n                                       47\n\f      1. Factual and procedural background\n            a. General background\n      Smith was arrested on August 13, 2015. She pled not guilty and not\nguilty by reason of insanity in May of 2017, at which time the trial court\nappointed two doctors, Drs. Cohen and Burke, to evaluate her. Dr. Cohen\nsubmitted a report to the court in November 2017. The following month,\nDr. Berke submitted a report to the court. In their reports, both doctors\nopined that Smith was insane at the time of the offense.\n      The People retained Dr. Mohandie in January 2018. On April 18,\nSmith withdrew her time waiver and the matter was set for trial, to\ncommence on May 21, 2018.\n      Dr. Mohandie interviewed Smith on May 2 and 7.\n      On May 21, and on several dates thereafter, the matter was continued.\nOn June 1, the matter was set for trial to commence on June 6.\n      Dr. Mohandie e-mailed the prosecutor his report on June 1. The\nprosecutor provided Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report to defense counsel that same day.\n      b. Smith\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\n      Smith filed a motion in limine on June 6 requesting that the trial court\nprohibit the prosecution from calling Dr. Mohandie as a witness. Smith\nrecounted the background of the case, including the facts pertaining to\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s retention by the prosecution, and Dr. Mohandie\u2019s interview of\nSmith on May 2 and 7. Defense counsel requested that the court preclude\n\nDr. Mohandie from testifying pursuant to section 1054.5, subdivision (b).31\n\n\n\n\n31    Section 1054.5, subdivision (b) provides a list of possible remedies for\nfailure to comply with California statutory discovery provisions, including\n\u201cdelaying or prohibiting the testimony of a witness or the presentation of real\nevidence.\u201d\n                                       48\n\f      On June 8, defense counsel filed a declaration in support of her motion\nto preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying. Defense counsel stated that on\nJune 4 and June 5, she had contacted three psychologists to potentially\nretain to review Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and data from the psychological\ntesting that he had performed. Defense counsel indicated that two of the\npsychologists had been unable to assist the defense, given time constraints\ndue to the imminence of the pending trial. One psychologist stated that he\nwould be unable to assist because he was on vacation. Defense counsel stated\nthat Dr. Mohandie still had not released the \u201craw data\u201d related to the\npsychological testing and noted that Dr. Mohandie would release the data\nonly to a defense retained psychologist.\n      The People filed a motion and supporting declaration pertaining to\ntheir request that Dr. Mohandie be allowed to testify. In the supporting\ndeclaration, the prosecutor provided a timeline of the events between\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s retention in January 2018 to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s production of his\nreport on June 1, 2018. The timeline noted that the manner by which\nDr. Mohandie would be permitted to examine Smith was litigated throughout\nearly 2018, including whether the examination would be videotaped, the\ntypes of psychological testing that would be permitted, and whether defense\ncounsel would be allowed to be present for the examination. The prosecutor\nalso noted that Dr. Mohandie had examined Smith on May 2 and 7, 2018, and\nthat it had taken Dr. Mohandie \u201c24 days to complete a 57-page report,\u201d which\nwas provided to the defense on June 1. The People contended that they had\n\u201cacted diligently and Dr. Mohandie acted diligently and reasonably, in\ncompleting the examination of defendant Smith.\u201d\n      The trial court held a hearing on the motion. At the June 8 hearing,\ndefense counsel acknowledged that the prosecutor had \u201cforward[ed] the\ninformation [from Dr. Mohandie] as soon as they received it,\u201d but argued that\n                                      49\n\fthe production \u201cwas not only untimely but extremely prejudicial.\u201d Defense\ncounsel emphasized that she had not been able to retain a psychologist to\nreview the psychological testing performed by Dr. Mohandie. Counsel also\nargued that the People had delayed too long in hiring Dr. Mohandie.\n      The prosecutor responded by arguing that it was not until two court\nappointed doctors, Drs. Cohen and Berke, had completed their reports in late\n2017 that the People retained a psychologist. The prosecutor argued \u201cwe\nwere waiting for the . . . appointed doctors to come back with their\nrecommendations,\u201d which the prosecutor characterized as \u201cnormal.\u201d\nThereafter, the prosecutor recounted various proceedings that were required\nin order for Dr. Mohandie to perform his evaluation, and argued, \u201c[B]ottom\nline . . . is that in my opinion Dr. Mohandie acted diligently and reasonably in\nsetting up the interviews, conducting the examination of the defendant, and\nproducing the report, and that was provided to the defense just as [defense\ncounsel] stated.\u201d\n      The court stated that it had discussed the case in chambers with\ncounsel, including the fact that the matter had \u201cproceed[ed] [on] a time\nwaived basis until April of 2018, and at that time[,] the time waiver was\nwithdrawn.\u201d However, the court noted that after the withdrawal of the time\nwaiver, the defense had agreed to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s examinations. The court\nultimately denied the motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying. The\ncourt also ruled that Dr. Mohandie would be permitted to rely on the results\nof the psychological testing that he had performed and ordered the prosecutor\nto tell Dr. Mohandie to provide the raw data from the psychological testing to\nany psychologist identified by the defense. The court further noted that it\nhad offered to continue the trial to give the defense time to retain a\npsychologist, but the defense had indicated that it wished to proceed.\n\n\n                                       50\n\f      After the trial court ruled, defense counsel stated that she wanted to\npreserve her objection, raised in chambers, that failing to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying would deny Smith the effective assistance of\ncounsel. Defense counsel, added, \u201cI also wanted the Court to know that I\nbelieve it\u2019s a violation of . . . both her state and federal due process rights.\u201d\n             c. Relevant trial proceedings\n\n      During the sanity phase of the trial, Dr. Cohen testified32 that she was\nfamiliar with two psychological tests that Dr. Mohandie had administered to\nSmith\u2014the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS) and the\nMinnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI-II). She explained\nthe ways in which the SIRS test functions and the ways in which it is used to\ndetect malingering. She was \u201cvery familiar\u201d with the MMPI-II, and discussed\nits use, scoring, and functions at length. In addition, Dr. Cohen testified that\nDr. Mohandie had sent her Smith\u2019s MMPI-II and SIRS test data and she had\nreviewed in detail Smith\u2019s scores on various components of the MMPI-II.\nDr. Berke also testified and explained that Smith had no scores in either the\n\u201cdefinite\u201d or \u201cprobable feigning\u201d range on the SIRS test.\n\n      The defense also cross-examined Dr. Mohandie33 at length pertaining\nto both the SIRS and the MMPI-II tests. Dr. Mohandie agreed with defense\ncounsel that Smith\u2019s SIRS test \u201ccame back as her being honest.\u201d\nDr. Mohandie also stated that the MMPI-II test validated his diagnosis of\n\u201cmajor depression.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n32     Dr. Cohen testified on July 3, 2018, nearly one month after the court\u2019s\nJune 8, 2018 hearing on Smith\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying.\n\n33    The cross-examination occurred on July 5, 2018.\n                                    51\n\f         At the conclusion of the sanity phase of the trial, outside the presence\nof the jury, the trial court stated that it was denying a defense request for a\njury instruction pertaining to the untimely disclosure of evidence. The court\nsaid that the primary reason that it was denying the request was because the\ncourt had offered to continue the trial to permit the defense additional time to\nrespond to Dr, Mohandie\u2019s report and the defense had declined the court\u2019s\noffer.\n         2. Governing law\n         Section 1054.1 outlines a prosecutor\u2019s discovery obligations and\nprovides in relevant part:\n            \u201cThe prosecuting attorney shall disclose to the defendant or\n            his or her attorney all of the following materials and\n            information, if it is in the possession of the prosecuting\n            attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the\n            possession of the investigating agencies:\n\n            \u201c[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n            \u201c(e) Any exculpatory evidence.\n\n            \u201c(f) Relevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or\n            reports of the statements of witnesses whom the prosecutor\n            intends to call at the trial, including any reports or\n            statements of experts made in conjunction with the case,\n            including the results of physical or mental examinations,\n            scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons which the\n            prosecutor intends to offer in evidence at the trial.\u201d\n\n         Section 1054.7 provides the time frame within which discovery\ndisclosures must be made and provides in relevant part:\n            \u201cThe disclosures required under this chapter shall be made\n            at least 30 days prior to the trial, unless good cause is\n            shown why a disclosure should be denied, restricted, or\n            deferred. If the material and information becomes known\n            to, or comes into the possession of, a party within 30 days of\n\n                                         52\n\f         trial, disclosure shall be made immediately, unless good\n         cause is shown why a disclosure should be denied,\n         restricted, or deferred.\u201d\n\n      Section 1054.5 prescribes various remedies that a court may employ for\na discovery violation in relevant part as follows:\n         \u201c(b) . . . Upon a showing that a party has not complied with\n         Section 1054.1 . . . and upon a showing that the moving\n         party complied with the informal discovery procedure\n         provided in this subdivision, a court may make any order\n         necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter,\n         including, but not limited to, immediate disclosure,\n         contempt proceedings, delaying or prohibiting the\n         testimony of a witness or the presentation of real evidence,\n         continuance of the matter, or any other lawful order.\n         Further, the court may advise the jury of any failure or\n         refusal to disclose and of any untimely disclosure.\n\n         \u201c(c) The court may prohibit the testimony of a witness\n         pursuant to subdivision (b) only if all other sanctions have\n         been exhausted. The court shall not dismiss a charge\n         pursuant to subdivision (b) unless required to do so by the\n         Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\n      In People v. Lewis (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 257 (Lewis), the Court of\nAppeal summarized the relevant law governing a claim under Brady v.\nMaryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83 (Brady):\n         \u201cUnder Brady, the prosecution violates a defendant\u2019s\n         federal due process rights when it suppresses evidence\n         material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment, regardless\n         of the good faith belief of the prosecution. (Brady, supra,\n         373 U.S. at p. 87.) Prosecutors have a duty to disclose\n         \u2018material exculpatory evidence whether the defendant\n         makes a specific request [citation], a general request, or\n         none at all [citation].\u2019 [Citation.] There are three elements\n         to a Brady violation: (1) the state withholds evidence,\n         either willfully or inadvertently, (2) the evidence at issue is\n         favorable to the defendant, either because it is exculpatory\n\n                                       53\n\f         or impeaching, and (3) the evidence is material. [Citation.]\u201d\n         (Lewis, supra, at p. 263.)\n\n      \u201cEvidence actually presented at trial is not considered suppressed for\nBrady purposes, even if that evidence had not been previously disclosed\nduring discovery.\u201d (Mora and Rangel, supra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 467.)\n      3. Application\n      It is undisputed that the prosecutor disclosed Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report to\n\ndefense counsel on the same day that the prosecutor received the report.34\nThus, the prosecutor complied with section 1054.7. (See \u00a7 1054.7 [\u201cIf the\nmaterial and information becomes known to, or comes into the possession of,\na party within 30 days of trial, disclosure shall be made immediately\u201d].)\nWhile Smith asserts that Dr. Mohandie was \u201can auxiliary service for the\nprosecutor, and thus part of the prosecution,\u201d she fails to cite any case law\nsupporting the proposition that a retained expert is considered a component\nof the prosecution for purposes of section 1054.7. Further, even assuming\nthat Dr. Mohandie could be considered \u201ca party\u201d for purposes of section\n1054.7, Smith makes no showing that Dr. Mohandie failed to disclose the\nreport as soon as he prepared it. Thus, we see no basis for concluding that\nthe trial court erred in refusing to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\nbased on the failure to timely disclose his report. (See, e.g., People v. Panah\n\n\n\n34    In addition, although Smith appears to base her claim in part on the\nalleged late disclosure of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s test data, Smith does not point to\nany evidence in the record indicating precisely when Dr. Cohen received the\ndata. However, Dr. Cohen testified at trial about her review of the \u201craw data\nthat was sent to [her] by [Dr. Mohandie],\u201d and she testified that \u201c[l]ooking at\nthe MMPI[-II] -- really, you know, looking at it in detail, confirmed my\nopinion.\u201d In short, Smith fails to demonstrate on appeal that any delay in\nsending the data to Dr. Cohen impeded Dr. Cohen\u2019s ability to conduct an\nanalysis of the data.\n                                      54\n\f(2005) 35 Cal.4th 395, 460 (Panah) [concluding that prosecution\u2019s disclosure\nof coroner\u2019s report prepared within 30 days of trial was timely under\ndiscovery statutes].)\n      We are similarly unpersuaded by Smith\u2019s assertion that the trial court\nshould have employed the drastic sanction of precluding Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying because the late discovery of the report was allegedly based on the\nprosecution\u2019s delay in retaining Dr. Mohandie and \u201cpermitting such a\ndeliberate evaluation process.\u201d The trial court could have reasonably\ndetermined that the prosecution retained Dr. Mohandie in a timely matter,\nshortly after the court appointed experts had submitted their reports opining\nthat Smith was insane at the time of the charged offense. Further, the trial\ncourt could also have reasonably determined that the approximately four-\nmonth period between the time that the People retained Dr. Mohandie and\nthe time that he interviewed Smith was not unduly long in light of litigation\nconcerning the scope of his examination, as well time that Dr. Mohandie\ncould reasonably have been expected to need to prepare for the examination.\nIn addition, the record indicates that Dr. Mohandie completed his report in a\ntimely matter, less than a month after interviewing Smith. In sum, the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying given the absence of any demonstration that\nthe prosecutor violated section 1054.7.\n      We also reject Smith\u2019s Brady claim, given her failure to make any\nshowing that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report was suppressed. (See Lewis, supra,\n240 Cal.App.4th at p. 263 [first element of a Brady claim is that \u201cthe state\nwithholds evidence, either willfully or inadvertently\u201d].) As discussed ante,\nthe prosecutor provided the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report on the same\nday that the prosecutor received it, which was nearly a month prior to\ndefense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Mohandie and presentation of\n                                      55\n\fexpert testimony evaluating Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report. (See Mora and Rangel,\nsupra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 467 [noting that evidence presented at trial is not\nconsidered to have been suppressed, particularly where defendant has not\nmade a showing that any delay in disclosure prevented defense counsel from\neffectively preparing and presenting a defense].) Finally, in light our\nconclusion that the trial court did not err in determining that the prosecutor\nhad not violated California\u2019s statutory discovery law or Brady, and after\nconsideration of Smith\u2019s presentation of a defense during the sanity phase of\nthe trial, including her counsel\u2019s extensive cross-examination of\nDr. Mohandie and presentation of Dr. Berke and Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony with\nrespect to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s psychological testing, we reject Smith\u2019s contention\nthat \u201c[l]ate disclosure also deprived [Smith] of an adequate opportunity to\npresent a complete defense and for counsel to be effective at trial.\u201d35 (Cf.\nPeople v. Thompson (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1043, 1105 [\u201cthe proper exercise of a\ntrial court\u2019s discretion under section 1054.7 does not violate a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s confrontation or due process rights\u201d]; Panah, supra, 35 Cal.4th at\np. 460 [\u201cwe reject the edifice of constitutional error that defendant constructs\nupon his claim of discovery violation\u201d].)\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion or violate Smith\u2019s constitutional rights by refusing to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nprovide Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data.\n\n\n\n\n35    While Smith argues that the \u201cdefense was not prepared\u201d to attack\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s opinion, she fails to address specifically what testimony or\nevidence defense counsel could have presented if Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and\ndata had been provided to the defense earlier.\n                                       56\n\fF. Smith is not entitled to reversal of the sanity verdict pursuant to the\n   cumulative error doctrine\n\n      As with the guilt phase, Smith contends that the cumulative effect of\nthe errors that she alleges occurred during the sanity phase requires reversal\nof the sanity verdict. We have found no errors to cumulate. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the cumulative error doctrine does not require reversal of the\nsanity verdict.\n                                    IV.\n                                DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                              AARON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nO\u2019ROURKE, Acting P.

Code, \u00a7 187)1 and found true a deadly\nweapon enhancement allegation (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)).2 Smith\u2019s mother,\nAnne Smith (Anne), was the victim. During the sanity phase of the trial, the\njury found that Smith was legally sane at the time she committed the offense.\nThe trial court sentenced Smith to a term of 16 years to life in prison,\nconsisting of a 15 years to life term for the murder and a one-year consecutive\nterm for the deadly weapon enhancement.\n      On appeal, with respect to the guilt phase, Smith claims that the trial\ncourt erred in excluding certain evidence pertaining to the severity of her\ndepression at the time of the incident giving rise to the charged offense. In\naddition, Smith contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the\njury sua sponte on involuntary manslaughter as an uncharged lesser\nincluded offense to murder. Smith also maintains that the cumulative error\ndoctrine requires reversal of the guilt-phase verdicts.\n      With respect to the sanity phase, Smith claims that the trial court\nviolated her constitutional right to due process under Doyle v. Ohio (1976)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\">426 U.S. 610</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (Doyle) and its progeny by admitting evidence that she\nclaims amounted to a comment on her exercise of her right to remain silent\npursuant to Miranda v.

Finally, Smith\ncontends that the cumulative error doctrine requires reversal of the sanity\nverdict.\n      In a published portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court\ndid not err in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of\ninvoluntary manslaughter because there is no substantial evidence in the\nrecord to support the giving of the instruction. In another published portion\nof this opinion, we conclude that the trial court did not commit Doyle error.\nWe reject the remainder of Smith\u2019s claims in unpublished portions of this\nopinion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n                                        II.\n                          FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA. Guilt-phase evidence\n      1. Smith\u2019s mental illness\n      Smith suffered from depression for many years. In 1995, Smith began\nto see a psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Brauer, on a somewhat regular basis and\ncontinued to see him until shortly before her commission of the offense.\nDr. Brauer testified that he had diagnosed Smith with both major depressive\ndisorder and dysthymia, with the former being more severe and episodic, and\nthe latter being a milder version of the disorder that was longer lasting.\nDr. Brauer prescribed various psychiatric medications to Smith throughout\nthe time that he treated her. Smith also received care from a different\nphysician, Dr. Schwartley, for a thyroid condition.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      2. Smith\u2019s December 2014 move into Anne\u2019s residence\n      Smith moved into Anne\u2019s residence in December 2014.3 After Smith\nmoved in, Anne became concerned that Smith was sleeping excessively. She\ncalled Dr. Brauer\u2019s office to let him know that Smith was sleeping about\n18 hours per day. Anne was also concerned about the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d that\nSmith owned. Anne\u2019s desire to give away Smith\u2019s clothes was a source of\nconflict between the two.\n      3. The murder\n      On August 12, 2015, during an argument, Smith hit Anne in the head\nrepeatedly with a hammer, killing her.\n      4. Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call4\n      The next afternoon, Smith called 9-1-1 and told the operator that she\nhad killed her mother. Smith told the operator, \u201cWe had a terrible fight, and\nI killed her with a hammer.\u201d After Smith told the operator that the killing\nhad taken place the prior day, the operator asked Smith why she had waited\nso long to call 9-1-1. Smith responded, \u201cI just freaked out, and I was just\ntrying to, I don\u2019t know, I was trying to sleep and pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nWhen asked by the operator what the argument was about, Smith said that\nher mother was \u201cgonna give all my clothes away.\u201d Smith added that she had\n\u201cborrowed a lot of her [mother\u2019s] money,\u201d and also noted that she and her\nmother would both become \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Smith also told the 9-1-1\noperator about her strange sleep patterns, which Smith stated was caused by\nantidepressants that she was taking.\n\n\n3    Smith testified that she had previously lived with Anne for\napproximately 21 days in 2013. According to Smith, she moved out and told\nAnne that she could not live with Anne.\n\n4     The 9-1-1 call was played for the jury during the trial.\n                                       4\n\f      5. The investigation\n      When police arrived, they found Anne\u2019s body in the living room. There\nwas a hammer close to her body. Portions of Anne\u2019s skull were on the\nground, eight to ten feet from her body, and her brain matter was exposed in\nthe areas where the skull was missing. Anne suffered eight lacerations in the\narea above her left ear and behind her forehead, as well as extensive skull\nfractures and injuries to the brain. According to a medical examiner, Anne\u2019s\ncause of death was \u201c[b]lunt force injuries including cranial cerebral injuries\ndue to strikes by [a] hammer.\u201d\n      In addition to fatal head injuries, Anne had a number of defensive\ninjuries consisting of lacerations and contusions on both forearms and on one\nof her hands, as well as fractures to her left wrist and forearm. Smith\nsuffered no physical injuries.\n      Shortly after her arrest, while in a patrol car, Smith told a detective at\nthe scene, \u201cI killed my mom.\u201d\n      6. The defense\n      Smith testified and admitted killing Anne with a hammer. According\nto Smith, on the morning of the killing, she and her mother were packing up\nsome of Smith\u2019s belongings that Anne had insisted Smith donate to charity.\nThis was upsetting to Smith. While they were packing, Anne made several\ndemeaning comments to Smith, and a heated verbal argument ensued.\n      During the argument, Smith picked up a hammer. Anne attempted to\ntake the hammer from Smith and the two began to struggle. Smith hit her\nmother on the head with the hammer four times. Smith testified that she\nthought that the incident was a dream. Smith stated, \u201cAnd I hit her with a\nhammer in the head, and I remember hitting her four times, all in a row, like\nreally fast, and it was like a dream.\u201d\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      After killing her mother, Smith went to bed in the hope that the\n\u201cdream\u201d would end. She called the police the following morning and told the\n9-1-1 operator that she had killed her mother.\n      Dr. Pablo Stewart, a psychiatrist, testified that Smith suffered from\nmajor depressive disorder and hypothyroidism. Dr. Stewart suggested that\nthe evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the killing could have\ncaused Smith to act rashly and out of emotion or passion rather than\njudgment.\nB. Sanity-phase evidence\n      1. The defense\u2019s presentation of evidence of Smith\u2019s insanity\n      The defense presented three mental health experts, each of whom\nopined that Smith was insane at the time of the killing. Two court-appointed\nexperts, Dr. David Berke and Dr. Ashley Cohen, opined that Smith did not\nknow the nature and quality of her acts and she did not appreciate that her\nacts were legally or morally wrong. The third expert, Dr. Stewart,5 testified\nthat, in his opinion, Smith knew the nature and quality of her acts, but did\nnot know that her acts were legally or morally wrong.\n      All three experts diagnosed Smith as suffering major depressive\ndisorder and hypothyroidism. In addition, each of the three experts stated\nthat, in their opinion, Smith had suffered an episode of depersonalization and\nderealization\u2014a mental disorder prompted by stress\u2014at the time of the\nkilling. Dr. Stewart described depersonalization and derealization as \u201csort of\nlooking down at oneself being in some sort of a dream state, not being in full\ncontrol of your body functions and your thought processes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n5      Dr. Stewart was retained by the defense and he testified in both the\nguilt and sanity phases of the trial.\n                                      6\n\f      The doctors each interviewed Smith, and her statements during these\ninterviews formed part of each doctor\u2019s assessment that Smith had suffered a\ndissociative experience at the time of the offense. For example, Dr. Stewart\nstated, \u201cBased on my interview with her, which was confirmed by her\ntestimony where she said she flipped out and that she was in a dream -- felt\nlike she was in a dream, all of that is -- I'm convinced that she was in a period\nof depersonalization at the time of the crime.\u201d Dr. Berke stated that Smith\nhad described herself as being like a passenger in a car and in a dream.\nSimilarly, Dr. Cohen agreed with defense counsel that Smith had described\nher mental state at the time of the offense as \u201calmost being two different\npeople, one, a passenger in a vehicle, and one was driving the vehicle.\u201d\n      2. The People\u2019s presentation of evidence of Smith\u2019s sanity\n      The prosecution presented the testimony of psychologist Dr. Kris\nMohandie. Dr. Mohandie opined that Smith\u2019s claim of being \u201cout of body as if\na passenger . . . in a vehicle,\u201d during the offense was \u201cmalingered,\u201d and\n\u201cmanufactured,\u201d and that Smith\u2019s claim of experiencing that \u201csymptom [was]\nbogus.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\u2019s conclusion was based, in part, on his review of\nSmith\u2019s 9-1-1 call. Specifically, Dr. Mohandie pointed to Smith\u2019s\n\u201cextraordinary sharing of information spontaneously in [the] 9-1-1 call,\u201d and\nthe \u201cemotionality,\u201d that she displayed during the call, both of which\nDr. Mohandie stated, \u201cyou don\u2019t see if a person is out of body, if you will, or\ndistancing themselves from what has happened.\u201d Dr. Mohandie also noted\nthat Smith described the killing during the 9-1-1 call in a manner that\nindicated that she knew that the killing had happened, noting that Smith\nhad said on the 9-1-1- call, \u201c \u2018I tried to pretend that it didn\u2019t happen.\u2019 \u201d\n      In addition, Dr. Mohandie stated that, during his interview of Smith,\nshe used language that was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with an out-of-body\nexperience,\u201d including \u201cus[ing] feeling terms when . . . describ[ing] the\n                                         7\n\fviolence that she inflicted upon her mother.\u201d6 Dr. Mohandie also noted that\nin describing the events surrounding the killing during his interviews with\nher, Smith displayed \u201cno hazing of consciousness,\u201d and that the \u201cgestures\nthat [Smith] ma[de] spontaneously while describing these things, [were] . . .\ninconsistent with some sort of out of body experience.\u201d\n      Another factor that caused Dr. Mohandie to \u201crule[ ] out,\u201d \u201cderealization\nor depersonalization,\u201d was that Smith had not experienced dissociation on a\nrecurrent basis. Dr. Mohandie noted that there was \u201cno evidence of any\ndissociative or depersonalization experiences before or after.\u201d In addition,\nDr. Mohandie noted that episodes of depersonalization and derealization are\nordinarily prompted by \u201can acute stressor,\u201d and observed that \u201c[t]here\u2019s\nnothing about that episode [before the killing] that\u2019s going to cause violence.\u201d\nDr. Mohandie also stated that Smith had engaged in \u201cgoal-directed\u201d behavior\nnear the time of the offense, including retrieving a hammer, that was\ninconsistent with Smith\u2019s claim of having suffered a dissociative experience.\n      Dr. Mohandie supported his opinion that Smith was malingering by\nstating that there was evidence that Smith had engaged in malingering while\nincarcerated after her arrest. Specifically, Dr. Mohandie referred to an\nincident during which \u201c[Smith] exaggerated and made suicidal statements as\na way of trying to get her medications renewed or expedited.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\nalso noted that there was evidence that Smith had reviewed a mental health\nreport while she was undergoing mental health evaluations, which was\n\u201cconcerning,\u201d because it could \u201cpotentially . . . contaminate and educate\n[Smith] further even about how this process works.\u201d Dr. Mohandie did\nacknowledge that Smith had received a score of \u201chonest responding,\u201d on a\n\n\n\n6     During the sanity phase, the People played two video recordings of\nportions of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s interviews of Smith.\n                                      8\n\fpsychological test that he administered to her called the Structured Interview\nof Reported Symptoms (SIRS), which is designed to detecting malingering.7\n      Dr. Mohandie opined that at the time of the murder, Smith knew the\nnature and quality of her actions and knew that her actions were both\nmorally and legally wrong. He believed that Smith was \u201cabsolutely sane.\u201d\n                                       III.\n                                 DISCUSSION\nA. Smith fails to establish any error with respect to either the trial court\u2019s\n   limitation of the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony or the trial court\u2019s\n   exclusion of testimony pertaining to Smith\u2019s journal entries\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court erred in excluding evidence during the\nguilt phase of the trial pertaining to the severity of her depression at the time\nof the incident. Specifically, Smith claims that the trial court erred in\nlimiting the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony concerning her level of\ndepression at the time of the incident and excluding testimony pertaining to\nSmith\u2019s journal entries related to her depression. Smith claims that the\nevidence was relevant to rebut evidence that the People had presented to\nshow that \u201c[her] depression was not severe and [was] improving.\u201d\n      1. The People\u2019s presentation of evidence pertaining to Smith\u2019s\n         statements concerning her level of depression in 2014 and 2015\n\n      Dr. Brauer testified that Smith told him during a July 2014 visit that\nshe was \u201cfeeling better,\u201d and he noted that \u201cshe had low anxiety and mild\ndepression\u201d at that time. Dr. Brauer also stated that he spoke with Smith in\n\n\n7       Dr. Mohandie also administered the Minnesota Multi-Phasic\nPersonality Inventory-II (MMPI-II) psychological test to Smith.\nDr. Mohandie stated that the results of this test showed that there \u201cwas some\ntendency to over-endorse or exaggerate what was going on.\u201d Dr. Mohandie\nalso testified that the MMPI-II was \u201cpicking up depression,\u201d and it \u201cpicked\nup . . . anxiety.\u201d\n                                      9\n\fOctober 2014 and that she \u201cdescribed feeling minimally depressed and\n[having] low-level anxiety.\u201d Dr. Brauer further stated that Smith wrote in\nJanuary 2015 that she was \u201cfeeling better.\u201d Finally, when asked how Smith\nappeared at an April 2015 visit, Dr. Brauer testified:\n          \u201cShe was in pretty good condition. She reported -- in her\n          handwriting again -- \u2018feeling better.\u2019 I judged her stable.\n          She had no complaints. She mentioned that she was living\n          with her mother in Sunnyvale, and my mental status exam,\n          at that point, was unremarkable, you know, she was -- I\n          noted her as being appropriate in appearance, appropriate\n          in behavior, with mild depression and mild anxiety, not\n          tearful, oriented times [three], no side effects, alert, no\n          essential change in her mental status.\u201d\n\n      2. Smith did not preserve her claim that the trial court erroneously\n         limited the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony\n\n             a. Factual and procedural background\n      After the prosecutor called its last witness in the guilt phase, the trial\ncourt held a hearing with counsel outside the presence of the jury. During\nthe hearing, the prosecutor indicated that both parties had \u201csupplemental\n\nmotions,\u201d with respect to Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony.8 The prosecutor indicated\nthat he did not want Dr. Stewart to testify about Smith\u2019s sanity during the\nguilt phase of the trial.\n      In response, defense counsel stated that it was not her intention to\nhave Dr. Stewart testify about \u201canything regarding sanity.\u201d Thereafter, the\ncourt clarified, \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to get into his examination of Ms. Smith,\nright?\u201d\n\n\n8     Although it appears that the People and the defense drafted written\nmotions concerning Dr. Stewart\u2019s prospective testimony, neither party cites\nto such motions in their brief on appeal and no such motions appear in the\nrecord.\n                                      10\n\f      Defense counsel explained that it was her intention \u201cto introduce\ntestimony that [Dr. Stewart] has diagnosed [Smith] with major depressive\ndisorder . . . during his evaluation.\u201d\n      After the court expressed skepticism concerning the relevance of such a\ndiagnosis, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that [Dr. Stewart] can get up\nhere and testify about everything that the defendant told him . . . .\u201d\n      After further discussions among the court, the prosecutor, and defense\ncounsel concerning the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony, the hearing\nconcluded with the following colloquy:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Is the Court concerned that these\n         statements [that Smith made to Dr. Stewart during his\n         interviews with her after her arrest] have not been\n         introduced to the jury during the trial?

What was\n         missing was that the opinion was based on specific\n         information he obtained from evaluating appellant and that\n         this was why he opined her depression continued to be\n         significant up to the time of the incident.

[Citation.][12]\n\n         \u201cAn opinion is only as good as the basis it rests on.\n         [Citation.] A broad statement that Dr. Stewart interviewed\n         appellant did not provide a factual basis for why he opined\n         she was depressed at the time of the incident.

Application\n      During the trial court\u2019s discussion with the prosecutor and defense\ncounsel, the trial court expressed reservations about permitting Dr. Stewart\nto testify to out-of-court statements that Smith made to Dr. Stewart during\nhis evaluation of her. However, the court made clear that its ruling was\nsubject to further consideration; the court stated, \u201cwe can go over it a little\n\n\n12   This citation is to page 976 of the reporter\u2019s transcript, which we\nquoted in part III.A.2.a, ante.

(Smith, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 632.) The defense\u2019s\nfailure to do so at any time during Dr. Stewart\u2019s testimony precludes Smith\nfrom arguing on appeal that the trial court erred in purportedly limiting\nDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony (see ibid.) and precludes this court from reversing on\nthat ground. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.)\n      Accordingly, we conclude that Smith did not adequately preserve her\nclaim that the trial court erroneously limited the scope of Dr. Stewart\u2019s\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n13    Indeed, Smith fails, even in her brief on appeal, to specify what\n\u201cspecific information,\u201d from Dr. Stewart\u2019s evaluation she was purportedly\nimproperly prevented from presenting at trial.\n                                      15\n\f      3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony\n         pertaining to Smith\u2019s journal entries\n\n            a. Factual and procedural background\n      The defense called City of Sunnyvale Detective Matthew Hutchinson as\na witness. Defense counsel asked Detective Hutchinson whether he had had\nthe opportunity to review \u201csome journal entries that were made by Linde\nSmith in this case.\u201d Detective Hutchinson responded in the affirmative.\nShortly thereafter, the following colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Is it true that Ms. Smith had journal\n         entries about feeling depressed?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Objection. Hearsay.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Sustained. Can I see counsel in the\n         hallway[?]\u201d\n\n      After the conference in the hallway, defense counsel indicated that she\nhad no further questions.\n      Subsequently, outside the presence of the jury, the following colloquy\noccurred pertaining to the court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, in regards to Officer -- or\n         Detective Hutchinson\u2019s testimony, the Defense sought to\n         elicit testimony from the detective that he reviewed a\n         journal that Ms. Smith had kept. In the journal, she made\n         entries about feeling depressed, unmotivated, experiencing\n         recurring nausea. I believe the Court -- there was an\n         objection as to hearsay, the Defense believed that this was\n         a prior consistent statement to rebut what Dr. Brauer had\n         said regarding the fact that Ms. Smith had indicated her\n         depression was under control.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Do you want to say anything?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Submitted.\n\n\n                                      16\n\f        \u201c[The court:] All right. As I indicated, the questions had to\n        do with the officer talking about entries in the journal that\n        was found in the defendant\u2019s room, I guess. And at one\n        point, when we were in the hallway, defense counsel said\n        that she believed that these statements were prior\n        consistent statements. If so, there was no intervening prior\n        inconsistent statements such that they would become\n        relevant, and to -- and I didn\u2019t think there was an adequate\n        foundation for the fact that the journal was hers that could\n        be laid by that witness, and so I precluded that testimony.\u201d\n\n            b. Governing law and standard of review\n     Evidence Code sections 1236 and 791 pertain to the admissibility of\nprior consistent statements of a witness. Evidence Code section 1236\nprovides:\n        \u201cEvidence of a statement previously made by a witness is\n        not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement\n        is consistent with his testimony at the hearing and is\n        offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section 791.\u201d\n\n     Evidence Code section 791 provides:\n\n        \u201cEvidence of a statement previously made by a witness that\n        is consistent with his testimony at the hearing is\n        inadmissible to support his credibility unless it is offered\n        after:\n\n        \u201c(a) Evidence of a statement made by him that is\n        inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing\n        has been admitted for the purpose of attacking his\n        credibility, and the statement was made before the alleged\n        inconsistent statement; or\n\n        \u201c(b) An express or implied charge has been made that his\n        testimony at the hearing is recently fabricated or is\n        influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the\n        statement was made before the bias, motive for fabrication,\n        or other improper motive is alleged to have arisen.\u201d\n\n\n                                     17\n\f      Evidence Code section 1202 pertains to evidence offered to attack or\nsupport the credibility of a hearsay declarant and provides in relevant part:\n         \u201cEvidence of a statement or other conduct by a declarant\n         that is inconsistent with a statement by such declarant\n         received in evidence as hearsay evidence is not\n         inadmissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of\n         the declarant though he is not given and has not had an\n         opportunity to explain or to deny such inconsistent\n         statement or other conduct.

Application\n      On appeal, Smith argues that testimony concerning the journal entries\nwas admissible under Evidence Code section 1202 to impeach Dr. Brauer\u2019s\ntestimony that Smith had \u201creported to him only mild depression and she was\n\nfeeling better.\u201d14 In other words, Smith claims that the evidence was\n\n\n14     In her opening brief, Smith also appears to assert that her journal\nentries were admissible pursuant to Evidence Code sections 791 and 1236 as\nevidence of her prior consistent statements.

The court began by outlining the elements of\nmurder, including the element of malice:\n         \u201cMurder is \u2018the unlawful killing of a human being, or a\n         fetus, with malice aforethought.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[M]alice may\n         be express or implied. It is express when there is\n         manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away\n         the life of a fellow creature.\u2019 [Citation.] It is implied when\n         the defendant engages in conduct dangerous to human life,\n         \u2018 \u201cknows that his conduct endangers the life of another\n         and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u201d \u2019\n         [Citation.]\u2019 (Id. at p. 30.)\n\n      The Brothers court explained that \u201cboth voluntary and involuntary\nmanslaughter are lesser included offenses of murder.\u201d (Brothers, supra,\n\n                                        21\n\f236 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.) After describing voluntary manslaughter, the\nBrothers court described involuntary manslaughter as follows:\n         \u201cInvoluntary manslaughter, in contrast, [is the] unlawful\n         killing of a human being without malice. (\u00a7 192.) It is\n         statutorily defined as a killing occurring during the\n         commission of \u2018an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony;\n         or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce\n         death, [accomplished] in an unlawful manner, or without\n         due caution and circumspection.\u2019 (\u00a7 192, subd. (b).)\n         Although the statutory language appears to exclude\n         killings committed in the course of a felony, the Supreme\n         Court has interpreted section 192 broadly to encompass an\n         unintentional killing in the course of a noninherently\n         dangerous felony committed without due caution or\n         circumspection.\u201d (Id. at p. 31.)\n\n      The Brothers court concluded that an instruction on \u201cinvoluntary\nmanslaughter as a lesser included offense must [also] be given when\na rational jury could entertain a reasonable doubt that an unlawful killing\nwas accomplished with implied malice during the course of an inherently\ndangerous assaultive felony.\u201d (Brothers, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 34,\nitalics added.)19\n\n\n\n\n19    The Brothers court reached this conclusion after first explaining that,\nordinarily, \u201cwhen [a] homicide occurs during the commission of an inherently\ndangerous felony, the homicide may be murder under the felony-murder rule,\nirrespective of the presence or absence of malice.\u201d (Brothers, supra,\n236 Cal.App.4th at p. 31, italics added.) However, the Brothers court noted\nthat, under the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d (id. at p. 31, fn. 5), when the underlying\nfelony is an assaultive crime, the assault merges with the homicide, and\napplication of the felony-murder rule is prohibited. (Id. at p. 31.) The\nBrothers court ultimately concluded that \u201can unjustified homicide in the\ncourse of an inherently dangerous assaultive felony (that is, a killing not\namounting to felony murder) and accomplished without malice is . . .\ninvoluntary manslaughter.\u201d (Id. at p. 32.)\n                                       22\n\f                  ii. Mental illness and malice\n      Prior to legislative changes adopted in 1981, a defendant was able to\npresent evidence that she lacked the capacity to form malice. (See People v.\nElmore (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">59 Cal.4th 121</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135 [\u201cDiminished capacity was a judicially\ncreated concept,\u201d that \u201callowed defendants to argue that because of mental\ninfirmity, they lacked \u2018awareness of the obligation to act within the general\nbody of laws regulating society,\u2019 and therefore were incapable of acting with\nmalice\u201d]; see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at p. 138</span><pre class=\"inline\"> [\u201cThe 1981 amendments make clear the Legislature\nintended to eliminate the notion of diminished capacity\u201d].)\n      In People v. McGehee (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">246 Cal.App.4th 1190</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1208 (McGehee), the\ncourt summarized the current state of the law pertaining to the relevance of\nevidence of a defendant\u2019s mental illness and malice:\n         \u201cWhile diminished capacity no longer mitigates an\n         intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter [citation], a\n         defendant \u2018is still free to show that because of his [or her]\n         mental illness or voluntary intoxication, he [or she] did not\n         in fact form the intent unlawfully to kill (i.e., did not have\n         malice aforethought). [Citation.] In a murder case, if this\n         evidence is believed, the only supportable verdict would be\n         involuntary manslaughter or an acquittal. If such a\n         showing gives rise to a reasonable doubt, the killing\n         (assuming there is no implied malice) can be no greater\n         than involuntary manslaughter.\u2019 ([Citation]; see also \u00a7 28,\n         subd. (a) [\u2018Evidence of mental disease, mental defect, or\n         mental disorder is admissible solely on the issue of whether\n         or not the accused actually formed a required specific\n         intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice\n         aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged\u2019].)\n\n         \u201cThus, in a murder case, instructions on involuntary\n         manslaughter are required where there is substantial\n         evidence that may come in the form of evidence of the\n         defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether\n         or not that defendant actually formed the intent to kill.\u201d\n         (Ibid.)\n\n                                      23\n\f                  iii. Assault with a deadly weapon\n      \u201c[A]ssault with a deadly weapon is a general intent crime; the required\nmens rea is \u2018an intentional act and actual knowledge of those facts sufficient\nto establish that the act by its nature will probably and directly result in the\napplication of physical force against another.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Perez (2018)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.5th 1055</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1066 (Perez).)\n      3. Application\n      As discussed in part III.B.2.a, ante, it is well established under\nCalifornia law that in order for a trial court to have a sua sponte duty to\ninstruct on a lesser included offense, there must be \u201c \u2018evidence from which a\njury composed of reasonable persons could conclude \u201cthat the lesser offense,\nbut not the greater, was committed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Wilson (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 Cal.5th\n259</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (Wilson).) Thus, in order for Smith to prevail on her claim that the\ntrial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on involuntary\nmanslaughter based on her commission of an assault with a deadly weapon,\nthere must be evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Smith\ncommitted an assault-based involuntary manslaughter, but not murder based\non express or implied malice. Our review of the evidence presented during\nthe guilt phase reveals no such evidence.\n      With respect to her commission of the homicide, Smith testified that,\njust before the killing, the victim made several comments that Smith\nconsidered to be demeaning. Smith became emotional and picked up a\nhammer. According to Smith, the victim attempted to take the hammer away\nfrom Smith. After a physical struggle, Smith described the events that\nensued:\n          \u201cAnd I still had the hammer in my hand, and she was to my\n          left, and I was right next to her. And I hit her with a\n          hammer in the head, and I remember hitting her four\n                                       24\n\f         times, all in a row, like really fast, and it was like a dream.\n         And I heard the sound, it was her skull cracking. And then\n         I could feel something that it felt like I hit, like, Jello. And\n         something about that, like, snapped me back into, like,\n         what was going on. And I looked down at my mom, and she\n         was bleeding and her head was -- was wounded, and I\n         suddenly realized that I had done this and I started saying,\n         \u2018Mommy, oh my God, Mommy, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 \u201d\n\n      In light of this testimony, we assume for purposes of this opinion that\nthe jury could have found that Smith was in a dream-like state at the time of\nthe killing and lacked express or implied malice while repeatedly striking the\nvictim in the head with a hammer. However, if the jury so found, the jury\ncould not also have found that Smith, while acting in a dream-like state, had\n\nthe intent to commit an assault with a deadly weapon.20 Specifically, a jury\nthat found that Smith was in a dream-like state and without malice while\nhitting her mother in the head with a hammer could not also have found that,\nat the same time, Smith committed an \u201c \u2018intentional act [with] actual\nknowledge of those facts sufficient to establish that the act by its nature will\nprobably and directly result in the application of physical force against\nanother.\u2019 \u201d (Perez, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 1066, italics added.) That is because\nthere is no evidence in the record from which the jury could reasonably find\nthat Smith, while acting in a dream-like state, was, at the same time, acting\n\n\n\n\n20     In her brief on appeal, Smith asserts, without citation to any evidence\nin the record, that \u201c[w]hile she had the intent to assault, it was not so clear in\nlight of her mental illness, she had malice or the intent to kill.\u201d (Italics\nadded.) As discussed in the text, our review of the record reveals no evidence\nupon which a trier of fact could find that she lacked malice but \u201chad the\nintent to assault.\u201d\n\n                                        25\n\fintentionally.21 Further, because the commission of an assault requires an\nintentional act, a reasonable jury could not find that Smith was in a dream-\nlike state and also find that she was acting in an intentional manner\nsufficient to commit an assault. Because there was no evidence that would\nhave supported a conclusion that Smith committed the lesser offense of an\nassault-based involuntary manslaughter, but not the greater offense of\nmurder, no lesser included offense instruction on involuntary manslaughter\nwas warranted. In short, Smith either committed murder, voluntary\nmanslaughter,22 or no offense at all.\n      We acknowledge that there are broad statements in case law\nsuggesting that, when a defendant is charged with murder, an instruction on\ninvoluntary manslaughter is required whenever the jury could find that the\ndefendant lacked an intent to kill. (See McGehee, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1208 [\u201c[I]n a murder case, instructions on involuntary manslaughter are\nrequired where there is substantial evidence that may come in the form of\nevidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether or\n\n\n21    At oral argument, Smith\u2019s counsel argued that, although Smith knew\nthat she was hitting her mother in the head repeatedly with a hammer and\nthus had the intent to commit an assault, because of her mental illness and\nemotional state, she did not appreciate the dangerousness of such act.\nHowever, we see no evidence in the record, including Smith\u2019s testimony\nrecounted above, from which a reasonable jury could make such a finding.\nStated differently, there is no evidence that any dissociative state under\nwhich Smith was acting at the time of the offense operated in this peculiar\nmanner, i.e., there is no evidence that Smith\u2019s mental state was such that\nthat she maintained an understanding that she was hitting her mother in the\nhead repeatedly with a hammer, but lacked sufficient cognition to \u201c \u2018 \u201cknow[ ]\nthat [her] conduct endanger[ed] the life of another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Brothers, supra,\n236 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.)\n\n22    The trial court instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter based on\nheat of passion.\n                                       26\n\fnot that defendant actually formed the intent to kill\u201d]; People v. Rogers (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633651/people-v-rogers/\">39 Cal.4th 826</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 884 (Rogers) [\u201cAn instruction on involuntary manslaughter is\nrequired whenever there is substantial evidence indicating the defendant did\n\nnot actually form the intent to kill\u201d].)23 However, we understand the law to\nbe that, in order for a trial court to have a sua sponte duty to instruct on\ninvoluntary manslaughter, there must be substantial evidence from which\nthe jury could find that the defendant lacked express or implied malice, but\ncommitted the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. (People v.\nAbilez (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599854\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599854/people-v-abilez/\">41 Cal.4th 472</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 [\u201c \u2018If the evidence presents a material issue\nof whether a killing was committed without malice, and if there is substantial\nevidence the defendant committed involuntary manslaughter, failing to\ninstruct on involuntary manslaughter would violate the defendant\u2019s\nconstitutional right to have the jury determine every material issue\u2019 \u201d].) To\nconclude that an involuntary manslaughter instruction is required in every\ncase in which a jury could find that a defendant committed a killing but\nlacked malice would do away with the bedrock principle that an uncharged\nlesser included offense instruction is required only if there is substantial\nevidence upon which a jury could find both that the defendant did not commit\nthe greater offense, but did commit the lesser. (See, e.g., Wilson, supra,\n11 Cal.5th at p. 298.) We aware of no authority that would support such a\nconclusion and decline to reach it here.\n\n\n\n\n23    The formulations in McGehee and Rogers also should not be read to\nsuggest that murder requires proof an \u201cintent to kill,\u201d (McGehee, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">246 Cal.App.4th 1208</span><pre class=\"inline\">; Rogers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633651/people-v-rogers/\">supra, 39</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Cal.4th at p. 884), since implied\nmalice murder does not require proof of such intent. (See, e.g., People v.\nFontenot (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">8 Cal.5th 57</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 [\u201cmurder . . . requires an act causing the\ndeath of another, but not the intent to kill, as implied malice will suffice\u201d];\nPeople v. Gonzalez (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">54 Cal.4th 643</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 [same].)\n                                       27\n\f      We also are not persuaded by Smith\u2019s contention that there was\nsubstantial evidence supporting an involuntary manslaughter instruction\nbased on her having acted with criminal negligence. (Citing People v. Glenn\n(1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">229 Cal.App.3d 1461</span><pre class=\"inline\">.) In Glenn, the Court of Appeal concluded that\nan involuntary manslaughter instruction was required because \u201c[p]art of [the\ndefendant\u2019s] testimony suggests the stabbing [that resulted in a homicide]\nwas accidental.\u201d (Id. at p. 1465.) The testimony from which the Court of\nAppeal reached this conclusion was the following:\n         \u201cGlenn [the defendant] testified he removed the knife from\n         his waistband and placed it in his lap while he sat at the\n         counter. When he got up from the counter and started\n         walking toward the door he tried, at the same time, to put\n         the knife back in his pants. As he was walking and trying\n         to slip the foot-long knife back into his pants he heard the\n         victim coming up behind him. The victim appeared about\n         to grab Glenn and, in a reflex action, Glenn turned with the\n         knife in his hand and the knife entered the victim\u2019s chest\n         causing a fatal wound. Glenn stated, \u2018I didn\u2019t try to stick it.\n         It\u2019s just that when he turned--when I turned and he is\n         coming, and it just happened like at the same time.\u2019 \u201d (Id.\n         at pp. 1465\u20131466.)\n\n      There was no comparable evidence in this case from which a jury could\nhave reasonably found that Smith\u2019s acts in striking the victim in the head\nrepeatedly with a hammer was accidental.\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to\ninstruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter,\nbecause there is no substantial evidence to support the giving of the\n\ninstruction.24\n\n\n\n24    In the alternative, Smith argues that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance in failing to request an instruction on involuntary\nmanslaughter. Given our conclusion that there is no substantial evidence to\n                                        28\n\fC. Smith is not entitled to reversal of the guilt phase verdict pursuant to the\n   cumulative error doctrine\n\n      Smith contends that the cumulative effect of the errors that she alleges\noccurred during the guilt phase requires reversal of the guilt-phase verdict.\n\u201cUnder the \u2018cumulative error\u2019 doctrine, errors that are individually harmless\nmay nevertheless have a cumulative effect that is prejudicial.\u201d (In re Avena\n(1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1250805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1250805/in-re-avena/\">12 Cal.4th 694</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 772, fn. 32.) We have found no errors to cumulate.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the cumulative error doctrine does not require\nreversal of the guilt-phase verdict.\nD.

However, the People indicated\nthat they did not intend to introduce in evidence during their case in chief\n\n\n\n25     Smith also contends that \u201c[a]t the very least, the evidence should have\nbeen excluded under Evidence Code section 352.\u201d She also appears to\ncontend that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence because it was\nirrelevant. Smith did not assert Evidence Code section 352 or relevancy\nobjections in the trial court and as a result, her appellate claims on these\ngrounds are forfeited. (See Evid.

Dr. Stewart responded:\n         \u201cI asked her if she had planned to kill her mother and she\n         said no, she was in this dream-like state where she didn\u2019t\n         have control over her mental processes or control of her\n         body, and had a hammer in her hand and then she was in\n         this state, observing herself hitting her mother and that\n         during the course of the hitting, she -- as she has testified\n         to and as she told me, she said she snapped out of it when\n         she felt the hammer going into her mother\u2019s head. That\u2019s\n         what she said.\u201d\n\n      Shortly thereafter, the following colloquy occurred during which the\ntrial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s Doyle objections:\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] All right. Now, you talked to [Smith] in\n         May of 2017; is that correct, thereabouts?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] September of \u201916.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. But your report was May of 2017?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Correct.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. So you talked to her in\n         September?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] And January of \u201917.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] January of \u201917. Okay. Was that the first\n         time, to your knowledge, that [Smith] mentioned this idea\n         of depersonalization and derealization?\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Objection, Your Honor. Doyle error.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Overruled.\n\n\n                                       32\n\f         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] She never mentioned depersonalization or\n         derealization.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] She didn\u2019t use those words because that\u2019s\n         not in her vocabulary, but was that the first time, to your\n         knowledge -- and granted, this jury already knows that you\n         reviewed all the jail records and you reviewed all the police\n         records and so you reviewed all the statements of everyone\n         concerned, okay -- was that the first time that she\n         mentioned, when you met with her, this idea of being\n         outside of herself or being in a car or not acting within\n         herself?\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Same objection, Your Honor.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Overruled.\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] In my review of the police records, I don\u2019t\n         remember her describing that exact -- using those exact\n         terms of being in a dream state. I believe she said she got\n         in an argument with her mother and ended up hitting her\n         with a hammer. But to answer your question, I\u2019m unaware\n         of if [or] when she told me that, that that was the first time.\n         She may have said it to someone else that I\u2019m not aware\n         of.\u201d\n\n      Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor asked Dr. Stewart whether\nSmith had suggested having been in a state of derealization at the time of the\noffense during either the 9-1-1 call or during her conversation with a\ndetective immediately after her arrest:\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] All right. You heard the 9-1-1 call in this\n         case --\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] -- as part of the materials that were\n         provided to you?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n                                       33\n\f\u201c[The prosecutor:] She doesn\u2019t mention in that call any sort\nof comments that would lead you to believe that she was in\na state of derealization; right?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] In the call, no.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] Okay. And you\u2019ve heard also the patrol -\n- we\u2019re calling it an interview, but there\u2019s a colloquy\nbetween her and one of the detectives in the patrol car\nimmediately after the arrest. Do you know what I\u2019m\ntalking about?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] I believe she voluntary says something\nabout killing her mother.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] They said, \u2018It\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 and she\nsaid, \u2018It\u2019s not okay. I killed my mother.\u2019 Do you remember\nthat?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Yes.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] And there\u2019s no mention there of any sort\nof being outside of a body or anything of that sort; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Correct.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] You would agree that those statements\ncame much closer in time to the murder than your\nconversation with her; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Absolutely.\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] So at the time, the events would have\nbeen fresh in her mind; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Stewart:] Well, it certainly was closer in time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f            d. The discussion of Smith\u2019s Doyle objection among the court and\n               counsel outside the presence of the jury\n\n      During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart, the trial\ncourt excused the jury for a recess. During the recess, the following\ndiscussion of Smith\u2019s Doyle objection occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] I do want to put my objection on the\n         record in regards to questioning of Dr. Stewart about the\n         fact that the first time my client made statements\n         regarding the offense, that went to depersonalization and\n         derealization was when Dr. Stewart talked to her, I believe.\n         It\u2019s an error on the prosecution\u2019s part to ask questions\n         regarding her assertion of her Fifth Amendment right to\n         remain silent and not talk to the police at the time of the\n         incident, and so asking questions that are posed in that\n         manner opens the door now to, unfortunately, the Defense\n         might having to go into that area.\n\n         \u201c[The court:] Okay.\n\n         \u201c[The prosecutor:] Your Honor, I do not specifically recall --\n         I don\u2019t believe there is a mention in that -- and I know that\n         Counsel\u2019s referring to the questioning of the defendant by\n         Detective [DiGiovanna], in which she invoked and which\n         the People agreed we were not going to use. I don\u2019t believe\n         that she says anything about depersonalization or\n         derealization in that conversation. But in any event, I\n         certainly was not referring to that at all. I was specifically\n         referring to the statements that had been admitted here in\n         court which include the 9-1-1 call and the patrol [car]\n         questioning, as well as the defendant\u2019s own testimony. I\n         was not making any reference at all to that particular piece\n         of evidence.\n\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, I think posing questions\n         such as, \u2018This is the first time that Ms. Smith made\n         statements to you in regards to being in a dream-like state,\u2019\n         you know, \u2018not having control of her mental processes,\u2019 that\n         line of questioning, I think, is improper, given the fact that\n         she invoked with the police. I think if those questions were\n                                      35\n\f-- if she was interviewed by the police and those questions\nwere posed of her and she hadn\u2019t invoked then, she might\nhave made those statements. But the fact that she\ninvoked --\n\n\u201c[The court:] No. I understand your objection. [Dr. Stewart]\nsaid that he looked at the police reports. Did the police\nreports contain the statement that is not -- that the People\nhave indicated they\u2019re not using, the one that was made\nwhere she did invoke?\n\n\u201c[The prosecutor:] Yes. There is, I think, a summary by\nDetective [DiGiovanna] in there.\n\n\u201c[The court:] Okay. So [Dr. Stewart] looked in there. And\nmy recollection is that he didn\u2019t see any mention of these\nstatements in the police reports or in the 9-1-1 call or her\ntestimony, or -- but he specifically said he did not -- he says,\n\u2018I don\u2019t remember them in these other things, but I don\u2019t\nknow whether or not she has ever made those statements\nbefore.\u2019\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Your Honor, I think making any\ncomment on a person\u2019s invocation of their Fifth\nAmendment right, the fact that she previously didn\u2019t make\na statement when they have invoked, is error. Whether\nthey made any kind of statement during that limited\ninterview by Detective [DiGiovanna], just the reference to\nit, I believe, is error, and that was the basis for both my\nobjections during the time of questioning.\n\n\u201c[The court:] And I overruled it.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Yes.\n\n\u201c[The court:] Okay. I still think they should be overruled.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\f             e. Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony\n      Dr. Mohandie testified that the first time Smith described being in a\nstate of depersonalization or derealization was several months after the\n\noffense.27\n      During defense counsel\u2019s cross examination of Dr. Mohandie, the\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Do you have any evidence in the\n         discovery that you\u2019ve received indicating that [Smith]\n         checked out some books on mental disorders, specifically\n         depersonalization or derealization or any other mental\n         disorders?\n\n         \u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] I don\u2019t know anything about that, no.\n\n\n27    Although not material to Smith\u2019s claim, there is some ambiguity in the\nrecord as to the amount of time that Dr. Mohandie stated had passed from\nthe commission of the offense to Smith\u2019s first disclosure of dissociation.\nDuring direct examination, the prosecutor asked Dr. Mohandie to discuss\ninconsistencies between \u201cinformation that you learned versus the\ninvestigative documents . . . .\u201d Dr. Mohandie responded:\n         \u201cRight. Well, basically, the 9-1-1 call in particular, there\u2019s\n         a very clear discussion, in my opinion, of a statement, if you\n         will, by Ms. Smith about what happened. There was no\n         evidence whatsoever of any kind of dissociative experience\n         or depersonalization, which is what she\u2019s going to say later,\n         the first time nearly three months later, and certainly in the\n         interview with me on May 2nd of this year; so that\u2019s a very\n         significant inconsistency, that particular fact.\n         \u201cAnd there\u2019s no behavioral evidence of it during that 9-1-1\n         call, no references to anything that would be like that;\n         rather, it was quite the opposite, sort of lucid, it was very\n         present, it was very emotion-laden, which is not what you\n         would see.\u201d (Italics added.)\n       However, on cross-examination, Dr. Mohandie indicated that Smith\u2019s\nfirst disclosure had occurred a \u201cyear and three months,\u201d after the offense.\n(Italics added.)\n                                       37\n\f\u201c[Defense counsel:] So you don\u2019t have any basis for your\nclaim that you think she made this up afterwards?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] Well, the basis is -- I do have a basis. The\nbasis is that she\u2019s reporting a disorder that is not\nrealistically being reported in terms of how these things\nhappen, that is inconsistent with the behavioral and\nemotional evidence, as I see it, and that there was no\ncontemporaneous -- that is at the time or around the time --\nevidence of it, and it doesn\u2019t appear until the year and\nthree months later. That is the basis of my finding.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] And you\u2019re aware that that\u2019s the first\ntime that she speaks to a psychiatrist; is that correct, about\nher case?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] It may be.\n\n\u201c[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. And when she\u2019s arrested and she\nis charged with a crime and provided an attorney, at that\npoint, she\u2019s not allowed to be interviewed, is that fair to\nsay, without the consent of her attorney?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] You mean after she invoked?\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] If an individual is arrested, charged\nwith a crime, and given an attorney, no one is allowed to\ninterview her at that point; correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] True.\n\n\u201c[Defense counsel:] And so between that time and the time\nthat Dr. Stewart met with her, there was no opportunity for\nher to provide a statement to anyone except her attorney; is\nthat correct?\n\n\u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] In terms of an official statement, sure.\nAgreed.\u201d\n\n                              38\n\f            f. Smith\u2019s request for a pinpoint instruction and motion for a\n               mistrial\n\n      During a hearing outside the presence of the jury the following day, the\ntrial court indicated that defense counsel had stated in chambers that she\nbelieved that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith having invoked her right to\ncounsel was a violation of a court order because, just prior to having made\nthat statement, Dr. Mohandie had been admonished by counsel outside the\npresence of the jury not to refer to Smith\u2019s statements to the police after she\n\nhad invoked her right to counsel.28 Defense counsel stated the following:\n         \u201cI\u2019m asking the Court specifically for a pinpoint instruction\n         indicating that the witness for the prosecution intentionally\n         violated instructions from the judge. I didn\u2019t indicate \u2018court\n         order,\u2019 and that was the instructions you gave us in the\n         hallway to go outside, talk to him, let him know not to\n\n28    Specifically, the trial court stated that defense counsel believed that\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith\u2019s invocation violated a court order as\nfollows:\n         \u201cYou believe that that was a violation of a court order\n         because prior to that time, we had a discussion in the\n         hallway where we reaffirmed that the statements that\n         Ms. Smith made to police officers at the police station, not\n         the one that was referred to in the car at the scene, but\n         those statements were potentially a violation of Miranda.\n         We didn\u2019t really necessarily get to that because both\n         counsel agreed that the [prosecutor] agreed he was not\n         going to try and introduce that. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] So I don\u2019t know\n         that there was a specific ruling on it, but I\u2019m satisfied that\n         both the parties believe that it was a violation of Miranda.\n         And we reaffirmed in the hallway that he would not refer to\n         that, and then I came out, told [Dr. Mohandie] to go out\n         into the hallway with counsel, and I wasn\u2019t present, but\n         apparently that was told to [Dr. Mohandie], and then he\n         came back and it was after that that [Dr. Mohandie] made\n         this statement,\u201d about Smith invoking.\n                                       39\n\f         discuss anything in regards to the statements that\n         Ms. Smith made to the police because it was a violation of\n         her right when she invoked.\n\n         \u201cI also asked the Court to -- well, let me read the statement\n         in its entirety. \u2018The witness for the prosecution\n         intentionally violated instructions from the judge. You can\n         consider that fact when evaluating what weight to give to\n         this witness\u2019s credibility and testimony in this case. And,\n         furthermore, you should not consider any evidence\n         regarding Linde Smith\u2019s timing of her disclosures of\n         depersonalization and derealization episode.\u2019\n\n         \u201cAnd in regards to the last point, Your Honor, we\u2019ve had\n         multiple conversations regarding statements that have\n         been made -- or questions that have been asked in cross-\n         examination of my witnesses as well as statements made\n         by the prosecution witness that her -- Linde Smith\u2019s\n         reported symptoms regarding depersonalization and\n         derealization were actually a year and three months later,\n         and therefore, they\u2019re suspect. I believe, as I had\n         previously indicated to the Court, that that was a Doyle\n         error, and it is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n         due process rights of my client, as well as the Doyle case,\n         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\">426 U.S. 610</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n         \u201cI am requesting that the Court consider a mistrial, given\n         the fact that Dr. Mohandie made a statement regarding\n         invocation, and made several statements regarding the fact\n         that Linde Smith disclosed the statement a year and three\n         months later when she had, in fact, invoked her right to\n         remain silent.\u201d\n\n      The prosecutor objected to the giving of the instruction and argued that\nthere had been no Doyle violation. After further discussion from the\nprosecutor and the defense, the trial court ruled as follows:\n         \u201cAll right. Couple things. No. 1, with regard to the request\n         for a pinpoint instruction, and that instruction which is\n         Court Exhibit 1, I denied it as written, and for [a] number\n         of reasons, one of which being that I do not believe that I\n                                       40\n\f         have sufficient proof that the witness intentionally violated\n         an instruction from the judge.\n\n         \u201cAlso, the instruction says that you should not consider any\n         evidence regarding Linde Smith\u2019s timing of her disclosures\n         of depersonalization and derealization episode as part of\n         that instruction, and I think that\u2019s contrary to the evidence\n         and goes far beyond what he said.\n\n         \u201cI did propose that I would read the following, quote, \u2018When\n         Dr. Mohandie, in response to a question by defense counsel,\n         asked, quote, \u201cyou mean after she invoked,\u201d end quote, that\n         comment was an improper reference to the defendant\u2019s\n         actions and contrary to an agreement by the parties after a\n         discussion with the Court. You may not consider, for any\n         purpose, whether the defendant invoked any right, and you\n         may not consider the doctor\u2019s comment for any reason.\u2019\n\n         \u201cCounsel opted not to allow that -- or not to have that read\n         to the jury.\u201d\n\n      Defense counsel responded that the reason she had rejected the trial\ncourt\u2019s offer to provide its proposed instruction was that the court\u2019s proposed\ninstruction highlighted the issue of invocation, while the defense\u2019s proposed\ninstruction was \u201cmore vague.\u201d\n      The court interjected:\n         \u201cThat\u2019s fine. That was another reason for denying the\n         pinpoint instruction[,] the fact that it has no context. It\n         simply says, \u2018The witness for the prosecution intentionally\n         violated instructions from the judge.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t tell the jury\n         what particular instructions of the Court were violated, and\n         I think that is misleading as well.\u201d\n\n      The court also denied the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial.\n            g. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\n      During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor argued that it\nwas important for the jury to view Smith\u2019s interview with Dr. Mohandie in\n\n                                       41\n\fpart because \u201cit shows [the jury] the progression of her made-up story, okay?\u201d\nThe prosecutor continued:\n         \u201cWhen [Smith] first tells 9-1-1 what happened, she hasn\u2019t\n         yet thought of this idea of being outside a car and not being\n         in her own body, okay? She only adds that later when she\n         meets Dr. Stewart, okay?\n\n         \u201cBy the time the defendant got to court here and testified\n         before you, the day that she was examined and was cross-\n         examined by me, the story was complete.

Application\n      Smith argues, \u201cIn violation of Doyle, the prosecution\u2019s questions and\nthe resulting testimony, as well as Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony, suggested that\n[Smith\u2019s] claim of depersonalization or derealization was fabricated because\nshe did not mention it after invoking her right to silence under the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments,\u201d until speaking with mental health experts more\nthan a year after the offense. We are not persuaded.\n      We first consider the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Stewart.\nDr. Stewart testified on direct examination that he relied on \u201c[p]olice\nreports . . . [and] the Santa Clara County Jail medical and psychiatric\nrecords,\u201d in conducting his psychiatric evaluation of Smith. Dr. Stewart also\ntestified at length about the content of Smith\u2019s jail psychiatric records. Given\nDr. Stewart\u2019s testimony that he relied on \u201cpolice reports,\u201d and \u201cjail records,\u201d it\nwas not Doyle error for the prosecutor to ask Dr. Stewart whether there were\nany statements in the \u201cjail records\u201d and \u201cpolice reports\u201d indicating that Smith\nhad referenced \u201cthis idea of being outside of herself or being in a car or not\nacting within herself.\u201d Doyle is based on the idea that it is \u201cfundamentally\nunfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence\nto be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d (Doyle,\nsupra, 426 U.S. at p. 618.) However, the fundamental fairness concerns\n\n                                       44\n\fanimating Doyle and its progeny do not prohibit a prosecutor from cross-\nexamining a defense expert about whether there are statements to support\nhis opinion in the documents on which the defense expert has expressly\nstated that he relied. To conclude otherwise would be to allow the defendant\nto use \u201c \u2018the right to remain silent . . . [as] a \u201csword\u201d . . . to \u201ccut off the\nprosecution\u2019s \u2018fair response\u2019 to the evidence or argument of the defendant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(Champion, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1448.) Doyle is not to be applied in\nsuch an instance.\n      This is particularly so given that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not\nmake any specific reference to the police interview during which Smith\n\napparently invoked her right to remain silent.29 Instead, and in considering\nthe \u201ccontext of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry\u201d (Champion, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1448), we note that the specific statements of Smith that the prosecutor\ndid reference were Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call and her conversation with a detective\nimmediately after her arrest. The prosecutor did not violate Doyle by asking\nDr. Stewart whether Smith had mentioned depersonalization when making\nthese statements. (See Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\">supra, 447</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> U.S. at p. 408 [\u201cDoyle does not\napply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent\nstatements\u201d].)\n      Similarly, the gist of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s\nclosing argument that Smith references on appeal was that Smith\u2019s claim of\ndepersonalization lacked believability because her claim was inconsistent\nwith voluntary statements that she made near the time of the offense. (See\npt. III.D.1.e. and pt. III.D.1.g, ante.) For example, Dr. Mohandie noted that\nthere was \u201cno evidence whatsoever of any kind of dissociative experience or\ndepersonalization,\u201d in Smith\u2019s 9-1-1 call. Similarly, during his closing\n\n\n29    A transcript of the interview is not in the record.\n                                       45\n\fargument, the prosecutor argued that when Smith \u201cfirst tells 9-1-1 what\nhappened, she hasn\u2019t yet thought of this idea of being outside a car and not\nbeing in her own body,\u201d and that Smith \u201conly adds that later when she meets\nDr. Stewart . . . .\u201d Arguing such inconsistencies does not constitute Doyle\nerror. (See Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\">supra, 447</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> U.S. at p. 408.) Further, neither\nDr. Mohandie nor the prosecutor ever stated or suggested that Smith\u2019s\ntestimony was unbelievable because she had invoked her right to remain\nsilent during a police interview.\n      In addition, Dr. Mohandie\u2019s mention of Smith\u2019s invocation of her\nMiranda rights during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination did not constitute\nDoyle error or warrant the granting of a mistrial. While defense counsel\nargued that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s reference constituted an intentional violation of\nthe trial court\u2019s instructions, the record does not contain the precise\nadmonishment that Dr. Mohandie received prior to providing this testimony.\n(See fn. 28, ante.) Further, the trial court could have reasonably found that\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s reference to Smith\u2019s invocation reflected a good faith attempt\n\nto answer defense counsel\u2019s question.30 In sum, the trial court reasonably\ndetermined that it lacked \u201csufficient proof that the witness intentionally\nviolated an instruction from the judge.\u201d Further, the trial court\u2019s offer to\nprovide an admonishment to the jury was a reasonable approach to cure any\npotential prejudice from Dr. Mohandie\u2019s statement. And, while defense\n\n\n30    As noted in part III.D.1.e, ante, Dr. Mohandie referenced Smith\u2019s\ninvocation of her Miranda rights during the following colloquy:\n         \u201c[Defense counsel:] Okay. And when she\u2019s arrested and she\n         is charged with a crime and provided an attorney, at that\n         point, she\u2019s not allowed to be interviewed, is that fair to\n         say, without the consent of her attorney?\n         \u201c[Dr. Mohandie:] You mean after she invoked?\u201d\n                                    46\n\fcounsel acted reasonably in making the tactical decision to decline the trial\ncourt\u2019s offer to provide such admonishment, the trial court was not obligated\nto grant a mistrial based on Dr. Mohandie\u2019s mere mention of Smith\u2019s having\n\u201cinvoked.\u201d This is particularly true given that Dr. Mohandie agreed with\ndefense counsel that Smith had not had an opportunity to make an \u201cofficial\nstatement\u201d between the time she was provided with an attorney and the time\nthat Dr. Stewart interviewed her. Finally, the trial court provided a reasoned\nexplanation for denying defense counsel\u2019s requested pinpoint instruction, i.e.,\nthe instruction was vague and unsupported by the evidence.\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not violate Smith\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process under Doyle and its progeny.\nE. The trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate Smith\u2019s\n   constitutional rights by refusing to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\n   during the sanity phase due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\n   provide the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data\n\n      Smith claims that the trial court abused its discretion and violated her\nconstitutional rights in denying her request to preclude Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying during the sanity phase due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nprovide the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data.\n      A trial court\u2019s discovery rulings, including its resolution of claims\npertaining to the prosecution\u2019s alleged failure to timely comply with its\ndiscovery obligations, are reviewed for abuse of discretion.

Factual and procedural background\n            a. General background\n      Smith was arrested on August 13, 2015. She pled not guilty and not\nguilty by reason of insanity in May of 2017, at which time the trial court\nappointed two doctors, Drs. Cohen and Burke, to evaluate her. Dr. Cohen\nsubmitted a report to the court in November 2017. The following month,\nDr. Berke submitted a report to the court. In their reports, both doctors\nopined that Smith was insane at the time of the offense.\n      The People retained Dr. Mohandie in January 2018. On April 18,\nSmith withdrew her time waiver and the matter was set for trial, to\ncommence on May 21, 2018.\n      Dr. Mohandie interviewed Smith on May 2 and 7.\n      On May 21, and on several dates thereafter, the matter was continued.\nOn June 1, the matter was set for trial to commence on June 6.\n      Dr. Mohandie e-mailed the prosecutor his report on June 1. The\nprosecutor provided Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report to defense counsel that same day.\n      b. Smith\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\n      Smith filed a motion in limine on June 6 requesting that the trial court\nprohibit the prosecution from calling Dr. Mohandie as a witness. Smith\nrecounted the background of the case, including the facts pertaining to\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s retention by the prosecution, and Dr. Mohandie\u2019s interview of\nSmith on May 2 and 7. Defense counsel requested that the court preclude\n\nDr. Mohandie from testifying pursuant to section 1054.5, subdivision (b).31\n\n\n\n\n31    Section 1054.5, subdivision (b) provides a list of possible remedies for\nfailure to comply with California statutory discovery provisions, including\n\u201cdelaying or prohibiting the testimony of a witness or the presentation of real\nevidence.\u201d\n                                       48\n\f      On June 8, defense counsel filed a declaration in support of her motion\nto preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying. Defense counsel stated that on\nJune 4 and June 5, she had contacted three psychologists to potentially\nretain to review Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and data from the psychological\ntesting that he had performed. Defense counsel indicated that two of the\npsychologists had been unable to assist the defense, given time constraints\ndue to the imminence of the pending trial. One psychologist stated that he\nwould be unable to assist because he was on vacation. Defense counsel stated\nthat Dr. Mohandie still had not released the \u201craw data\u201d related to the\npsychological testing and noted that Dr. Mohandie would release the data\nonly to a defense retained psychologist.\n      The People filed a motion and supporting declaration pertaining to\ntheir request that Dr. Mohandie be allowed to testify. In the supporting\ndeclaration, the prosecutor provided a timeline of the events between\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s retention in January 2018 to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s production of his\nreport on June 1, 2018. The timeline noted that the manner by which\nDr. Mohandie would be permitted to examine Smith was litigated throughout\nearly 2018, including whether the examination would be videotaped, the\ntypes of psychological testing that would be permitted, and whether defense\ncounsel would be allowed to be present for the examination. The prosecutor\nalso noted that Dr. Mohandie had examined Smith on May 2 and 7, 2018, and\nthat it had taken Dr. Mohandie \u201c24 days to complete a 57-page report,\u201d which\nwas provided to the defense on June 1. The People contended that they had\n\u201cacted diligently and Dr. Mohandie acted diligently and reasonably, in\ncompleting the examination of defendant Smith.\u201d\n      The trial court held a hearing on the motion. At the June 8 hearing,\ndefense counsel acknowledged that the prosecutor had \u201cforward[ed] the\ninformation [from Dr. Mohandie] as soon as they received it,\u201d but argued that\n                                      49\n\fthe production \u201cwas not only untimely but extremely prejudicial.\u201d Defense\ncounsel emphasized that she had not been able to retain a psychologist to\nreview the psychological testing performed by Dr. Mohandie. Counsel also\nargued that the People had delayed too long in hiring Dr. Mohandie.\n      The prosecutor responded by arguing that it was not until two court\nappointed doctors, Drs. Cohen and Berke, had completed their reports in late\n2017 that the People retained a psychologist. The prosecutor argued \u201cwe\nwere waiting for the . . . appointed doctors to come back with their\nrecommendations,\u201d which the prosecutor characterized as \u201cnormal.\u201d\nThereafter, the prosecutor recounted various proceedings that were required\nin order for Dr. Mohandie to perform his evaluation, and argued, \u201c[B]ottom\nline . . . is that in my opinion Dr. Mohandie acted diligently and reasonably in\nsetting up the interviews, conducting the examination of the defendant, and\nproducing the report, and that was provided to the defense just as [defense\ncounsel] stated.\u201d\n      The court stated that it had discussed the case in chambers with\ncounsel, including the fact that the matter had \u201cproceed[ed] [on] a time\nwaived basis until April of 2018, and at that time[,] the time waiver was\nwithdrawn.\u201d However, the court noted that after the withdrawal of the time\nwaiver, the defense had agreed to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s examinations. The court\nultimately denied the motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying. The\ncourt also ruled that Dr. Mohandie would be permitted to rely on the results\nof the psychological testing that he had performed and ordered the prosecutor\nto tell Dr. Mohandie to provide the raw data from the psychological testing to\nany psychologist identified by the defense. The court further noted that it\nhad offered to continue the trial to give the defense time to retain a\npsychologist, but the defense had indicated that it wished to proceed.\n\n\n                                       50\n\f      After the trial court ruled, defense counsel stated that she wanted to\npreserve her objection, raised in chambers, that failing to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying would deny Smith the effective assistance of\ncounsel. Defense counsel, added, \u201cI also wanted the Court to know that I\nbelieve it\u2019s a violation of . . . both her state and federal due process rights.\u201d\n             c. Relevant trial proceedings\n\n      During the sanity phase of the trial, Dr. Cohen testified32 that she was\nfamiliar with two psychological tests that Dr. Mohandie had administered to\nSmith\u2014the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS) and the\nMinnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI-II). She explained\nthe ways in which the SIRS test functions and the ways in which it is used to\ndetect malingering. She was \u201cvery familiar\u201d with the MMPI-II, and discussed\nits use, scoring, and functions at length. In addition, Dr. Cohen testified that\nDr. Mohandie had sent her Smith\u2019s MMPI-II and SIRS test data and she had\nreviewed in detail Smith\u2019s scores on various components of the MMPI-II.\nDr. Berke also testified and explained that Smith had no scores in either the\n\u201cdefinite\u201d or \u201cprobable feigning\u201d range on the SIRS test.\n\n      The defense also cross-examined Dr. Mohandie33 at length pertaining\nto both the SIRS and the MMPI-II tests. Dr. Mohandie agreed with defense\ncounsel that Smith\u2019s SIRS test \u201ccame back as her being honest.\u201d\nDr. Mohandie also stated that the MMPI-II test validated his diagnosis of\n\u201cmajor depression.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n32     Dr. Cohen testified on July 3, 2018, nearly one month after the court\u2019s\nJune 8, 2018 hearing on Smith\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying.\n\n33    The cross-examination occurred on July 5, 2018.\n                                    51\n\f         At the conclusion of the sanity phase of the trial, outside the presence\nof the jury, the trial court stated that it was denying a defense request for a\njury instruction pertaining to the untimely disclosure of evidence. The court\nsaid that the primary reason that it was denying the request was because the\ncourt had offered to continue the trial to permit the defense additional time to\nrespond to Dr, Mohandie\u2019s report and the defense had declined the court\u2019s\noffer.\n         2. Governing law\n         Section 1054.1 outlines a prosecutor\u2019s discovery obligations and\nprovides in relevant part:\n            \u201cThe prosecuting attorney shall disclose to the defendant or\n            his or her attorney all of the following materials and\n            information, if it is in the possession of the prosecuting\n            attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the\n            possession of the investigating agencies:\n\n            \u201c[\u00b6] . . .

Lewis (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">240 Cal.App.4th 257</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Lewis), the Court of\nAppeal summarized the relevant law governing a claim under Brady v.\nMaryland (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\">373 U.S. 83</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Brady):\n         \u201cUnder Brady, the prosecution violates a defendant\u2019s\n         federal due process rights when it suppresses evidence\n         material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment, regardless\n         of the good faith belief of the prosecution. (Brady, supra,\n         373 U.S. at p. 87.) Prosecutors have a duty to disclose\n         \u2018material exculpatory evidence whether the defendant\n         makes a specific request [citation], a general request, or\n         none at all [citation].\u2019 [Citation.] There are three elements\n         to a Brady violation: (1) the state withholds evidence,\n         either willfully or inadvertently, (2) the evidence at issue is\n         favorable to the defendant, either because it is exculpatory\n\n                                       53\n\f         or impeaching, and (3) the evidence is material. [Citation.]\u201d\n         (Lewis, supra, at p. 263.)\n\n      \u201cEvidence actually presented at trial is not considered suppressed for\nBrady purposes, even if that evidence had not been previously disclosed\nduring discovery.\u201d (Mora and Rangel, supra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 467.)\n      3. Application\n      It is undisputed that the prosecutor disclosed Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report to\n\ndefense counsel on the same day that the prosecutor received the report.34\nThus, the prosecutor complied with section 1054.7. (See \u00a7 1054.7 [\u201cIf the\nmaterial and information becomes known to, or comes into the possession of,\na party within 30 days of trial, disclosure shall be made immediately\u201d].)\nWhile Smith asserts that Dr. Mohandie was \u201can auxiliary service for the\nprosecutor, and thus part of the prosecution,\u201d she fails to cite any case law\nsupporting the proposition that a retained expert is considered a component\nof the prosecution for purposes of section 1054.7. Further, even assuming\nthat Dr. Mohandie could be considered \u201ca party\u201d for purposes of section\n1054.7, Smith makes no showing that Dr. Mohandie failed to disclose the\nreport as soon as he prepared it. Thus, we see no basis for concluding that\nthe trial court erred in refusing to preclude Dr. Mohandie from testifying\nbased on the failure to timely disclose his report. (See, e.g., People v. Panah\n\n\n\n34    In addition, although Smith appears to base her claim in part on the\nalleged late disclosure of Dr. Mohandie\u2019s test data, Smith does not point to\nany evidence in the record indicating precisely when Dr. Cohen received the\ndata. However, Dr. Cohen testified at trial about her review of the \u201craw data\nthat was sent to [her] by [Dr. Mohandie],\u201d and she testified that \u201c[l]ooking at\nthe MMPI[-II] -- really, you know, looking at it in detail, confirmed my\nopinion.\u201d In short, Smith fails to demonstrate on appeal that any delay in\nsending the data to Dr. Cohen impeded Dr. Cohen\u2019s ability to conduct an\nanalysis of the data.\n                                      54\n\f(2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2509294\"><a href=\"/opinion/2509294/people-v-panah/\">35 Cal.4th 395</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (Panah) [concluding that prosecution\u2019s disclosure\nof coroner\u2019s report prepared within 30 days of trial was timely under\ndiscovery statutes].)\n      We are similarly unpersuaded by Smith\u2019s assertion that the trial court\nshould have employed the drastic sanction of precluding Dr. Mohandie from\ntestifying because the late discovery of the report was allegedly based on the\nprosecution\u2019s delay in retaining Dr. Mohandie and \u201cpermitting such a\ndeliberate evaluation process.\u201d The trial court could have reasonably\ndetermined that the prosecution retained Dr. Mohandie in a timely matter,\nshortly after the court appointed experts had submitted their reports opining\nthat Smith was insane at the time of the charged offense. Further, the trial\ncourt could also have reasonably determined that the approximately four-\nmonth period between the time that the People retained Dr. Mohandie and\nthe time that he interviewed Smith was not unduly long in light of litigation\nconcerning the scope of his examination, as well time that Dr. Mohandie\ncould reasonably have been expected to need to prepare for the examination.\nIn addition, the record indicates that Dr. Mohandie completed his report in a\ntimely matter, less than a month after interviewing Smith. In sum, the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying given the absence of any demonstration that\nthe prosecutor violated section 1054.7.\n      We also reject Smith\u2019s Brady claim, given her failure to make any\nshowing that Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report was suppressed. (See Lewis, supra,\n240 Cal.App.4th at p. 263 [first element of a Brady claim is that \u201cthe state\nwithholds evidence, either willfully or inadvertently\u201d].) As discussed ante,\nthe prosecutor provided the defense with Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report on the same\nday that the prosecutor received it, which was nearly a month prior to\ndefense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Mohandie and presentation of\n                                      55\n\fexpert testimony evaluating Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report. (See Mora and Rangel,\nsupra, 5 Cal.5th at p. 467 [noting that evidence presented at trial is not\nconsidered to have been suppressed, particularly where defendant has not\nmade a showing that any delay in disclosure prevented defense counsel from\neffectively preparing and presenting a defense].) Finally, in light our\nconclusion that the trial court did not err in determining that the prosecutor\nhad not violated California\u2019s statutory discovery law or Brady, and after\nconsideration of Smith\u2019s presentation of a defense during the sanity phase of\nthe trial, including her counsel\u2019s extensive cross-examination of\nDr. Mohandie and presentation of Dr. Berke and Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony with\nrespect to Dr. Mohandie\u2019s psychological testing, we reject Smith\u2019s contention\nthat \u201c[l]ate disclosure also deprived [Smith] of an adequate opportunity to\npresent a complete defense and for counsel to be effective at trial.\u201d35 (Cf.\nPeople v. Thompson (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1 Cal.5th 1043</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1105 [\u201cthe proper exercise of a\ntrial court\u2019s discretion under section 1054.7 does not violate a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s confrontation or due process rights\u201d]; Panah, supra, 35 Cal.4th at\np. 460 [\u201cwe reject the edifice of constitutional error that defendant constructs\nupon his claim of discovery violation\u201d].)\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion or violate Smith\u2019s constitutional rights by refusing to preclude\nDr. Mohandie from testifying due to the People\u2019s alleged failure to timely\nprovide Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and testing data.\n\n\n\n\n35    While Smith argues that the \u201cdefense was not prepared\u201d to attack\nDr. Mohandie\u2019s opinion, she fails to address specifically what testimony or\nevidence defense counsel could have presented if Dr. Mohandie\u2019s report and\ndata had been provided to the defense earlier.\n                                       56\n\fF. Smith is not entitled to reversal of the sanity verdict pursuant to the\n   cumulative error doctrine\n\n      As with the guilt phase, Smith contends that the cumulative effect of\nthe errors that she alleges occurred during the sanity phase requires reversal\nof the sanity verdict. We have found no errors to cumulate. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the cumulative error doctrine does not require reversal of the\nsanity verdict.\n                                    IV.\n                                DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                              AARON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nO\u2019ROURKE, Acting P.

M.B. is the father of Mother\u2019s\n\ntwo younger children, G.B. and L.B. The father of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) is deceased. R.R.\n\nand T.R. (\u201cCustodians\u201d) are the paternal aunt and uncle of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2).\n\n      {\u00b63}   On May 10, 2018, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and\n\nG.B. were dependent, neglected, and abused children. The complaint alleged as follows:\n\nSCDJFS received multiple referrals regarding the family dating back to October of 2017;\n\nthere were concerns about domestic violence in the home and concerns about substance\n\nabuse by both Mother and M.B.; there were reports that K.R.(1) was acting as the primary\n\ncaretaker for the younger children; school officials reported several incidents of concern;\n\nK.R.(1) sent a group text indicating she was going to commit suicide; SCDJFS contacted\n\nMobile Youth Crisis for K.R.(1); SCDJFS observed multiple adults coming out of the home\n\nwith large black trash bags; Mother denied substance abuse concerns, but refused to\n\ntake a drug test; K.R.(2) and G.B. had multiple observable scratches and bruises; Mother\n\nwas recently charged with OVI and possession of a controlled substance; M.B. was\n\nrecently convicted of domestic violence against Mother; both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) made\n\nmultiple concerning statements regarding events and inappropriate circumstances that\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                     3\n\n\noccurred while living with Mother and M.B.; and K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) repeatedly expressed\n\nconcern of returning to their prior home environment.\n\n      {\u00b64}   The magistrate held a shelter care hearing on May 11, 2018. On the same\n\nday, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. The trial\n\ncourt issued a judgment entry on August 1, 2018, finding K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\ndependent. Further, the court found \u201cMother was not available to care for the children as\n\nshe has absconded law enforcement and there are warrants out for Mother\u2019s arrest.\u201d The\n\ncase then proceeded to disposition. The disposition entry, also filed on August 1, 2018,\n\nplaced K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. in the legal custody of Custodians.\n\n      {\u00b65}   Mother filed a motion for change of custody and/or motion for visitation with\n\nregards to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. on December 28, 2018. SCDJFS filed a complaint\n\nwith regards to L.B. in February of 2019 a week after her birth. Mother tested positive for\n\nvarious substances during her pregnancy with L.B., including cocaine, marijuana, and\n\nmethamphetamines.\n\n      {\u00b66}   The trial court conducted a trial on Mother and Custodians\u2019 motions on\n\nSeptember 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020. The trial court also held an in-camera\n\ninterview of K.R.(2), as requested by Mother, on November 12, 2020.\n\n      {\u00b67}   Mother testified she lost her children in 2018 when her oldest child\n\nthreatened suicide.   Mother admitted she was addicted to methamphetamines from\n\nNovember of 2017 to March of 2018. She also admitted that, at the beginning of the case,\n\nshe misrepresented her substance abuse issues to SCDJFS. In 2017, M.B. pushed her\n\nand yelled at a lot. Both she and M.B. were abusing drugs. M.B. has a brain injury and\n\nsuffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from being the military. After Mother lost the\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      4\n\n\nchildren, she went to Florida to be with her mother. She used cocaine in July of 2018.\n\nWhen her brother overdosed in Ohio, she returned for several months, but then returned\n\nto Florida. Mother returned to Ohio to stay in February of 2019.\n\n       {\u00b68}   Mother began counseling in 2018 and remains in counseling today for\n\ngrief/trauma issues and drug abuse. Mother completed drug screens several times per\n\nweek and stated she was negative every time. Mother described her Vyvanse and\n\nAdderall medications, and stated she informed SCDJFS when those prescriptions\n\nchanged.\n\n       {\u00b69}   Mother stated she has complied with her case plan. Mother testified she is\n\ncurrently working, taking care of a hospice patient. Mother completed the Goodwill\n\nparenting program and is going through the home-based visitation program. She believes\n\nshe has done everything SCDJFS has asked of her to make the home appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b610} Mother also attends counseling with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2). Mother knows\n\nthat K.R.(1) is angry at her; however, Mother believes this anger is misplaced. Mother\n\nstated she is now clean and sober, and she has made significant changes in her life since\n\nshe lost custody of the children. She believes it is in the best interest of the children to\n\nbe returned to her care.\n\n       {\u00b611} On cross-examination, Mother confirmed there was a no-contact order\n\nbetween her and M.B. when she got pregnant with L.B.\n\n       {\u00b612} Jennifer Fire (\u201cFire\u201d) is the supervisor of the Goodwill parenting program.\n\nFire testified that Mother successfully completed the Goodwill parenting program;\n\nhowever, Mother failed on the individual goals portion of the program. Mother\u2019s home\n\nwas appropriate and, when Fire visited, Mother was utilizing the safety plan put in place\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    5\n\n\nby SCDJFS. Fire had concerns regarding Mother\u2019s substance abuse issues because,\n\nthroughout the program, Mother vacillated from accepting responsibility of that to\n\nminimizing it; Fire stated Mother never accepted full responsibility for her substance\n\nabuse problems, and blamed it on her ADHD and childhood trauma. Fire testified that\n\nMother minimized the impact that her substance abuse and domestic violence had on her\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b613} Nicole Hadden (\u201cHadden\u201d) is the ongoing caseworker for L.B. For both\n\nMother and M.B., their case plans required they complete parenting assessments,\n\ncomplete assessments at CommQuest, and follow any recommendations. M.B. complied\n\nwith the recommendations from his parenting evaluation, as he had to continue\n\ncounseling and medication services through the VA; comply with the orders of his\n\nprobation from his domestic violence conviction; and complete substance abuse\n\ntreatment. There were ongoing concerns with M.B. because his memory and mood\n\ndysregulation, and his questionable judgment related to a traumatic brain injury.\n\n       {\u00b614} Mother was required to comply with Summit Psychology for her medication\n\nand counseling, complete parenting classes, and attend joint counseling with M.B.\n\nMother initially was set up for the color code for approximately six months to monitor her\n\nfor illegal substances. Mother completed the parenting class, is in counseling each week,\n\nand completed the color code drug screens when asked.\n\n       {\u00b615} While Mother testified that she notified Hadden as soon as the doctor\n\nincreased her medication, Hadden stated that Mother advised her on June 9th by email\n\nthat she had a change in medication only after the aide had drug tested her that day. This\n\nconcerned Hadden with regards to Mother\u2019s long-term sobriety.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                       6\n\n\n       {\u00b616} When the home-based visits started, L.B. visited alone. However, when\n\nG.B. was added to the visits, Hadden testified that the clutter and things in the home that\n\nthey previously worked on getting rid of started to come back and it was difficult for Mother\n\nand M.B. to manage both children. Hadden knew the visits were difficult because of her\n\ninteractions with Mother and because Hadden supervised some of the visits herself. For\n\nexample, Mother\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic during the visits when both G.B.\n\nand L.B. were there.\n\n       {\u00b617} The GAL contacted Hadden after the review hearing in July of 2020,\n\nexpressing concern about Mother\u2019s appearance and behavior in court. Hadden wrote a\n\nletter to Mother\u2019s doctor about her concerns with Mother\u2019s medication. Based upon\n\nHadden\u2019s review of her notes and the records she received after Mother signed a release\n\nof information, it appeared that Mother was asking her doctor for Adderall. Mother\u2019s\n\ndoctor provided a letter to Hadden stating she is compliant with medication and he did not\n\nsee a concern prescribing Adderall.\n\n       {\u00b618} While Hadden believes the primary goal is reunification, she has concerns\n\nthat need to be addressed. Her concern for Mother\u2019s sobriety still remains, as does her\n\nconcern about Mother\u2019s dishonesty. Hadden testified that Mother has a history of being\n\ndishonest with her throughout the proceedings.\n\n       {\u00b619} Kristin Guardado is the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for all four children.\n\n       {\u00b620} K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) described to Guardado a life of chaos and anxiety,\n\nincluding watching Mother and M.B. do drugs and M.B. physically abuse Mother. K.R.(1)\n\nfelt it was her responsibility to care for G.B.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    7\n\n\n      {\u00b621} When Guardado first met K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), they were very thin, had\n\nextreme anxiety, and were very fearful Custodians would leave them. Both children talk\n\na lot about domestic violence between Mother and M.B. and their continual drug use.\n\nBoth children were very afraid to talk to anyone because Mother told them if they talked\n\nto people, Mother would go to jail. When K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) lived with Mother and M.B.\n\nprior to their removal, the house was filthy and the children were taking care of\n\nthemselves.    K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) had issues with school attendance.        K.R.(1) told\n\nGuardado that Mother permitted her half-brother to live in the home, despite K.R.(1)\u2019s\n\nreporting to Mother that the half-brother abused her.\n\n      {\u00b622} K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) are doing very well with Custodians. When Mother\n\nstopped her visitation with them, their anxiety and physical issues substantially\n\ndecreased. They are doing well in school. Both have expressed fear at being returned\n\nto Mother\u2019s care, and they do not trust her. Both are afraid of M.B. due to his past acts\n\nof domestic violence against Mother. Guardado testified it would be detrimental for\n\nK.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to be returned to Mother. Guardado believes Custodians continue to\n\nfacilitate a relationship between Mother and the children. However, Guardado believes\n\nthe two children should not be around M.B. until the counselor feels it is appropriate.\n\nGuardado thinks legal custody to Custodians is in the best interest of both children.\n\n      {\u00b623} On cross-examination, Guardado confirmed Mother has completed portions\n\nof her case plan. However, Guardado stated the children still have issues, and some of\n\nthe concerns arising at the beginning of the case with regards to Mother and M.B. still\n\ncontinue on.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                       8\n\n\n       {\u00b624} The trial court also admitted Guardado\u2019s August 2020 report into evidence.\n\nShe believes it is in the best interest of the children for: (1) Custodians to maintain legal\n\ncustody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.; (2) Custodians to be granted legal custody of L.B.;\n\n(3) Mother\u2019s motions to terminate and return to be denied; (4) Mother to continue to\n\nparticipate in therapeutic visits with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2); (5) K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to not be\n\naround M.B. until their counselor feels it is appropriate; (6) Mother and M.B. to have\n\nweekly 2-hour visits with L.B. and G.B.; and (7) M.B. not to be left unsupervised with the\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b625} Guardado reports that the children are thriving in their current home. They\n\nare all very close.\n\n       {\u00b626} Guardado included many details in her report, but concluded that she has\n\nconcerns about returning any of the children to Mother. This is due to Mother and M.B.\u2019s\n\ndishonesty throughout the case and their inability to take responsibility for their actions\n\nand instead blame others. Guardado stated the parties failed to alleviate the risks that\n\nwere present at the time of the removal.\n\n       {\u00b627} Amanda Van Buren (\u201cVan Buren\u201d) is a family coach at Goodwill parenting\u2019s\n\nhome-based parenting program. She works with Mother and M.B. weekly.\n\n       {\u00b628} Van Buren stated the visits with G.B. and L.B. are inconsistent. While some\n\nvisits go smoothly, sometimes Mother would rather discuss her own issues instead of\n\nspending time with the children. Initially, Van Buren and Mother addressed some safety\n\nconcerns in the home. Van Buren recently had to address some issues in the home in\n\nJuly. Van Burden also stated there are times where Mother and M.B. failed to adequately\n\nsupervise the children. Van Buren testified Mother\u2019s behavior is inconsistent, and has\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                        9\n\n\nbecome more erratic since July. Her main concerns regarding the safety of the children\n\nare: consistent demeanor, ability to supervise the children, and substance abuse.\n\n       {\u00b629} Jessica Skrzypiec (\u201cSkrzypiec\u201d) is a licensed clinician who did an\n\nassessment on Mother and continues to be her counselor.                Her diagnoses were\n\nadjustment disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Mother was not truthful\n\nduring her initial assessment about her substance abuse. However, during treatment in\n\nMarch of 2019, Mother admitted abusing her prescription Adderall. Skrzypiec stated\n\nMother\u2019s treatment has progressed well and she is not currently worried about Mother\n\nabusing medication because Mother has done well and has done everything Skrzypiec\n\nhas asked her to do.\n\n       {\u00b630} On cross-examination, Skrzypiec confirmed that on August 28, 2020 Mother\n\nwas very upset because she lost her job. However, Mother testified on September 1,\n\n2020 that she was still employed; thus, Mother lied to the court.\n\n       {\u00b631} R.R. is the current custodian of the children and has been since February\n\nof 2018. R.R. will follow any orders of the court with regards to this case. R.R. believes\n\nit is in the best interest of the children for R.R. and her husband to have legal custody of\n\nthe children, but also believes that Mother should have a relationship with G.B. and L.B.\n\nWith regards to visitation with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), R.R. defers to the children\u2019s counselor\n\nas to when that is appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b632} The trial court issued an extensive judgment entry on March 15, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b633} The trial court found the GAL\u2019s testimony credible and noted it took her\n\nreport into consideration in its decision. Additionally, the trial court stated it agreed with\n\nthe concerns reported by the GAL.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    10\n\n\n       {\u00b634} The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony questionable. As the first day of\n\ntrial progressed, \u201cMother\u2019s testimony became more garbled and lacking in a clear\n\ndirection. It was as if Mother placed some marbles or cotton in her mouth during the\n\nbreak session. Her recollection of events, especially as to time, degraded throughout\n\ncross-examination.\u201d The trial court cited several specific portions of Mother\u2019s direct and\n\ncross-examination to illustrate its point.\n\n       {\u00b635} The trial court found the credible testimony and the in-camera interview with\n\nK.R.(2) clearly establish that K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. were subjected to extremely\n\ntraumatic events while living with Mother, including missing meals, witnessing domestic\n\nviolence, witnessing drug abuse, suffering sexual abuse, and having their educational\n\nneeds neglected. However, Mother continues to deny or downplay this trauma, and even\n\ntestified that her children\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d changed, questioning their credibility.\n\n       {\u00b636} The trial court found the credible evidence bolstered the following concerns\n\nof the GAL: that Mother has not been truthful throughout the case; that Mother does not\n\naccept responsibility for the traumatic experiences of her children; and Mother continues\n\nto use excuses. Though Mother testified she is \u201cin a different place completely\u201d than\n\nbefore, the trial court stated the balance of the testimony does not support Mother\u2019s\n\nassertion.\n\n       {\u00b637} The trial court determined the evidence demonstrates Mother is not\n\nadequately able to supervise the children. For example, Fire testified Mother failed in her\n\nindividual goals and she still had concerns about Mother because of her drug use.\n\nFurther, Van Buren gave credible testimony that M.B. continues to have issues in\n\ndiscussing his triggers, and the visits with Mother and M.B. were inconsistent, and during\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      11\n\n\none visit, G.B. escaped from the home because the door was not locked and she was not\n\nbeing adequately watched. The trial court also noted Skrzypiec\u2019s testimony that Mother\n\nwas dishonest about her substance abuse, and that Mother is frequently overwhelmed.\n\n       {\u00b638} The trial court found Mother is not suitable to care for any of the children at\n\nthis time. Further, the credible evidence establishes that R.R. and T.R. are capable and\n\nwilling to care for and support all four of the children, and put the best interest of the\n\nchildren ahead of their own interests.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court then did an extensive review of the relevant best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a-j), and addressed them as follows: (a) Mother\n\ntestified she wants legal custody of all four children; however, the court questioned the\n\nsincerity of this request; (b) the interview with K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of the GAL\n\nand did not support Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wanted to live with her; (c) the children\n\nare bonded with each other and bonded to R.R. and T.R., while there is no healthy bond\n\nbetween the children and Mother; (d) the children are doing well in the home of\n\nCustodians, as this is a safe, loving, and healthy environment; however, Mother could not\n\nmeet the emotional, educational, or basic needs of the children and there is a legitimate\n\nconcern that the return of any of the children to her would place them at risk physically\n\nand emotionally; (e) M.B. is 100% disabled due to a traumatic brain injury, is not able to\n\ncare for any of the children, and has committed acts against Mother in the past; Mother\n\nand M.B. have used drugs; Mother\u2019s presentation in court was \u201coff\u201d and she appeared to\n\nbe suffering from some physical or mental ailment; Mother struggles with mental health\n\nstability and has trouble telling the truth; (f) Custodians appear most likely to facilitate\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      12\n\n\nvisitation; Mother did not follow orders in other cases and was not truthful with the GAL;\n\nand (g) Mother indicated child support is not current.\n\n       {\u00b640} The trial court concluded, upon review of the testimony presented and\n\nreview of the above-factors, it is in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) for Custodians\n\nto be granted legal custody. Further, it would not be in the best interest of K.R.(1) or\n\nK.R.(2) for Mother to be named their legal custodian.\n\n       {\u00b641} The trial court named R.R. and T.R. the legal custodians of K.R.(1) and\n\nK.R.(2), and denied Mother\u2019s motion for custody.\n\n       {\u00b642} Mother appeals the March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and assigns the following as error.\n\n       {\u00b643} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT\u2019S\n\nMOTION FOR A CHANGE OF LEGAL CUSTODY AND FOR A MOTION TO RETURN\n\nAND TERMINATE.\n\n       {\u00b644} \u201cII. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST\n\nWEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE AND VIOLATED MOTHER\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS.\u201d\n\n                                          Legal Custody\n\n       {\u00b645} The award of legal custody is \u201cnot as drastic a remedy as permanent\n\ncustody.\u201d In re L.D., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-985, 2013-Ohio-3214. This is because\n\nthe award of legal custody does not divest parents of their residual rights, privileges, and\n\nresponsibilities. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188.\n\n       {\u00b646} Before awarding legal custody to a non-parent, a trial court must ordinarily\n\nmake a finding that each parent is unsuitable. In re L.P., 5th Dist. Muskingum No.\n\nCT2016-0045, 2017-Ohio-52, citing In re Hockstock, 98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    13\n\n\nThis requirement does not apply, however, in cases involving abuse, neglect, or\n\ndependency. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that, \u201c[a] juvenile court adjudication\n\nof abuse, neglect, or dependency is a determination about the care and condition of a\n\nchild and implicitly involves a determination of the unsuitability of the child\u2019s custodial\n\nand/or noncustodial parents.\u201d In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843\n\nN.E.2d 1188. Thus, \u201c[w]hen a juvenile court adjudicates a child to be abused, neglected,\n\nor dependent, it has no duty to make a separate finding at the dispositional hearing that\n\na noncustodial parent is unsuitable before awarding legal custody to a nonparent.\u201d Id.\n\n      {\u00b647} In this case, both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) were adjudicated dependent.\n\n      {\u00b648} R.C. 2151.353(A) states, in pertinent part,\n\n      If a child is adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the court\n\n      may make any of the following orders of disposition:\n\n                                           ***\n\n      (3) Award legal custody of the child to either parent or to any other person\n\n      who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal\n\n      custody of the child or is identified as a proposed legal custodian in a\n\n      complaint or motion filed prior to the dispositional hearing by any party to\n\n      the proceedings * * *.\n\n      {\u00b649} A trial court \u201cmust have wide latitude in considering all the evidence\u201d and a\n\ncustody decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Davis v. Flickinger,\n\n77 Ohio St.3d 415, 674 N.E.2d 1159, citing Miller v. Miller, 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 523 N.E.2d\n\n846 (1988). As an appellate court, we neither weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility\n\nof the witnesses. Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                     14\n\n\ncredible evidence upon which the finder of fact could base its judgment. Cross Truck\n\nEquip. Co. v. The Joseph A. Jeffries Co., 5th Dist. Stark No. CA5758, 1982 WL 2911\n\n(Feb. 10, 1982). Accordingly, judgments supported by some competent and credible\n\nevidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed as being\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr., 54 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 279, 376 N.E.2d 578 (1978).\n\n       {\u00b650} Unlike in a permanent custody proceeding where a juvenile court\u2019s standard\n\nof review is by clear and convincing evidence, the standard of review in legal custody\n\nproceedings is a preponderance of the evidence.          In re S.D., 5th Dist. Stark Nos.\n\n2013CA0081, 2013CA0082, 2013-Ohio-5752.\n\n       {\u00b651} Issues relating to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given\n\nto the evidence are primarily for the trier of fact. Seasons Coal v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 77, 461 N.E.2d 1273 (1984). Deferring to the trial court on matters of credibility \u201cis\n\ncrucial in a child custody case, where there may be as much evidence in the parties\u2019\n\ndemeanor and attitude that does not translate to the record well.\u201d Davis v.

Mother argues she completed her case plan services, has\n\nemployment, and is medically compliant. She also contends the trial court\u2019s finding it was\n\nin the best interest of the children for Custodians to be awarded custody was against the\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                          15\n\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence because she was bonded to the children and completed\n\nher case plan.\n\n       {\u00b653} We disagree with Mother.\n\n       {\u00b654} The statutory scheme regarding an award of legal custody does not include\n\na specific test or set of criteria, and a trial court must base its decision on the best interest\n\nof the child. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188; In re\n\nP.S., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00007, 2012-Ohio-3431. When determining the issue of\n\nlegal custody, the trial court should consider the totality of the circumstances. In re D.T.,\n\n5th Dist. Stark No. 2013CA00252, 2014-Ohio-2495. Trial courts should consider all\n\nfactors relevant to the best interest of the child. Id. This may include the best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 2151.414(D) and/or R.C. 3109.4(F), including: the wishes of\n\nthe child (expressed to the court or through the GAL) and the child\u2019s parents; the child\u2019s\n\ninteractions and interrelationship with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, and any other person\n\nwho may significantly affect the child; the custodial history of the child; the child\u2019s need\n\nfor a legally secure placement; the child\u2019s adjustment to their home, school, and\n\ncommunity; the mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation; and\n\nthe person more likely facilitate court-approved parenting time rights or visitation.\n\n       {\u00b655} Mother contends she has completed all her case plan requirements.\n\nHowever, the successful completion of a case plan is not dispositive on the issue of\n\nreunification. In re W.A.J., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99813, 2014-Ohio-604. While it may\n\nbe in Mother\u2019s best interest to complete the case plan, this is only one factor for a trial\n\ncourt to consider what is in the best interest of the child, and, \u201cin legal custody cases, trial\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      16\n\n\ncourts should consider all factors relevant to the best interest of the child.\u201d In the Matter\n\nof D.P. and G.P., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2010CA00348, 2011-Ohio-1907.\n\n       {\u00b656} Where a parent has participated in his or her case plan and completed most\n\nor all of the plan requirements, a trial court may still properly determine that such parent\n\nhas not substantially remedied the problems leading to agency involvement. In the Matter\n\nof A.L. and J.L., 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 11 CA 23, 2012-Ohio-481. In this case, the GAL\n\ntestified that while Mother has substantially completed her case plan, Mother failed to\n\nalleviate the risks present at the time of removal and the same concerns present at the\n\nbeginning of the case still continue today.\n\n       {\u00b657} The issue in this case is whether the preponderance of the evidence\n\ndemonstrated it was in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians. The trial court issued a detailed, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis as to\n\nwhy it determined it was in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to grant legal custody\n\nto Custodians and deny Mother\u2019s motions.          Further, though Mother contends she\n\nsubstantially remedied any problems leading to agency involvement, the testimony and\n\nevidence presented at the hearing do not support this conclusion.\n\n       {\u00b658} We find the determination by the trial court is supported by competent and\n\ncredible evidence.\n\n       {\u00b659} Mother had no contact with K.R.(1) or K.R.(2) for an extended period of\n\ntime while she was in Florida. Fire has continued concerns about Mother\u2019s substance\n\nabuse because she never accepted responsibility, and instead blamed it on her medical\n\nconditions and/or childhood trauma. Hadden similarly has concerns that remain about\n\nMother\u2019s long-term sobriety, particularly due to the Mother\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      17\n\n\nthroughout the proceedings. The GAL also has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s\n\nsobriety because of her recent jumpy and inappropriate appearance.              Van Buren\n\ndescribed Mother\u2019s behavior as inconsistent throughout the case, and more erratic since\n\nJuly. Van Buren has concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse. The trial court found\n\nMother\u2019s testimony about her remedying of concerns to not be credible and stated\n\nMother\u2019s testimony was garbled, lacked direction, and her recollection was not clear.\n\n       {\u00b660} Hadden and the GAL testified to Mother\u2019s dishonesty and inability to take\n\nresponsibility for her actions throughout the proceedings, and stated she had not\n\nremedied these concerns. Skrzypiec confirmed Mother initially lied to her about her\n\nsubstance abuse and lied to the court about her employment.\n\n       {\u00b661} Additionally, multiple witnesses had concerns about the visits K.R.(1) and\n\nK.R.(2)\u2019s younger siblings had with Mother. Hadden stated it was difficult for Mother to\n\nmanage both children. The GAL stated Mother could do short visits with G.B. and L.B.,\n\nbut could not manage them full-time. Van Buren stated the visits were inconsistent, and\n\nshe had concerns about both Mother and M.B.\u2019s ability to supervise the children.\n\n       {\u00b662} The GAL testified it is in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) for legal\n\ncustody to be granted to Custodians. Both have expressed fear about being returned to\n\nMother\u2019s care, and they do not trust her. When Mother stopped her visitation with them,\n\ntheir anxiety and physical issues substantially decreased. Both are afraid of M.B. due to\n\nhis past acts of domestic violence against Mother.          Guardado stated it would be\n\ndetrimental for K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to be returned to Mother, and believes Custodians will\n\ncontinue to facilitate a relationship between Mother and the children. However, Guardado\n\nbelieves the two children should not around M.B. until the counselor feels it is appropriate.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                         18\n\n\nGuardado testified that while Mother has worked hard, she is unable to appropriately\n\nparent. The interview of K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of Guardado and does not\n\nsupport Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wants to live with her.\n\n       {\u00b663} Guardado testified K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) are doing very well with Custodians.\n\nHadden describes Custodians as loving, cooperative, attentive, and bonded to the\n\nchildren. Further, G.B., L.B., K.R.(1), and K.R.(2) are very bonded to each other.\n\n       {\u00b664} Mother also claims the trial court did not consider the testimony about her\n\ngood visits, her continued counseling, and case plan compliance in its decision. However,\n\nwhile there was testimony about her case plan compliance and several good visits, there\n\nwas also testimony by multiple witnesses that the visits were inconsistent and many\n\nconcerns still remained. As this Court has previously stated, the trial court may believe\n\nall, part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it. Rogers v. Hill,\n\n124 Ohio App.3d 468, 706 N.E.2d 438 (4th Dist. 1998). Further, as discussed above,\n\nMother\u2019s compliance with her case plan is only one factor to consider in the best interest\n\ndetermination.\n\n                                            Due Process\n\n       {\u00b665} In the title of her second assignment of error, Mother asserts the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision violated her due process rights. However, Mother makes no argument in the\n\nbody of her brief as to how or why her due process rights were violated.\n\n       {\u00b666} \u201cIf an argument exists that can support [an] assignment of error, it is not this\n\ncourt\u2019s duty to root it out.\u201d Thomas v. Harmon, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 08CA17, 2009-\n\nOhio-3299, quoting State v. Carman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90512, 2008-Ohio-4368. \u201cIt\n\nis not the function of this court to construct a foundation for [an appellant\u2019s] claims; failure\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      19\n\n\nto comply with the rules governing practice in the appellate courts is a tactic which is\n\nordinarily fatal.\u201d Catanzarite v. Boswell, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24184, 2009-Ohio-1211.\n\nTherefore, \u201c[w]e may disregard any assignment of error that fails to present any citations\n\nto case law or statutes in support of its assertions.\u201d Frye v. Holzer Clinic, Inc., 4th Dist.\n\nGallia No. 07CA4, 2008-Ohio-2194; See also App.R. 16(A)(7); App.R. 12(A)(2); State v.\n\nNorman, 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 2010-CA-22, 2011-Ohio-596; State v. Untied, 5th Dist.\n\nMuskingum No. CT2006005, 2007-Ohio-1804.\n\n       {\u00b667} As pointed out by SCDJFS, Mother has made no argument to support this\n\nassertion, nor has she supported her allegations with references to the record or citations\n\nto authority to support a finding that the trial court violated her due process rights.\n\nAppellate Rule 16(A)(7) requires an appellant to include in his or her briefs, \u201c* * * [a]n\n\nargument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of\n\nerror presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions * * *.\u201d We may\n\nnot create an argument for Mother as to why her due process rights were violated. See\n\nState v. Carter, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2020-CA-0031, 2021-Ohio-358.\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b668} Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not commit error in\n\nawarding legal custody of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to Custodians or in denying Mother\u2019s\n\nmotion for custody.\n\n       {\u00b669} Accordingly, Mother\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                           20\n\n\n       {\u00b670} The March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common\n\nPleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.\n\nBy Gwin, P.J.,\n\nWise, John, J. and\n\nWise, Earle, J. concur\n\f",

M.B. is the father of Mother\u2019s\n\ntwo younger children, G.B. and L.B. The father of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) is deceased. R.R.\n\nand T.R. (\u201cCustodians\u201d) are the paternal aunt and uncle of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2).\n\n      {\u00b63}   On May 10, 2018, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and\n\nG.B. were dependent, neglected, and abused children. The complaint alleged as follows:\n\nSCDJFS received multiple referrals regarding the family dating back to October of 2017;\n\nthere were concerns about domestic violence in the home and concerns about substance\n\nabuse by both Mother and M.B.; there were reports that K.R.(1) was acting as the primary\n\ncaretaker for the younger children; school officials reported several incidents of concern;\n\nK.R.(1) sent a group text indicating she was going to commit suicide; SCDJFS contacted\n\nMobile Youth Crisis for K.R.(1); SCDJFS observed multiple adults coming out of the home\n\nwith large black trash bags; Mother denied substance abuse concerns, but refused to\n\ntake a drug test; K.R.(2) and G.B. had multiple observable scratches and bruises; Mother\n\nwas recently charged with OVI and possession of a controlled substance; M.B. was\n\nrecently convicted of domestic violence against Mother; both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) made\n\nmultiple concerning statements regarding events and inappropriate circumstances that\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                     3\n\n\noccurred while living with Mother and M.B.; and K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) repeatedly expressed\n\nconcern of returning to their prior home environment.\n\n      {\u00b64}   The magistrate held a shelter care hearing on May 11, 2018. On the same\n\nday, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. The trial\n\ncourt issued a judgment entry on August 1, 2018, finding K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\ndependent. Further, the court found \u201cMother was not available to care for the children as\n\nshe has absconded law enforcement and there are warrants out for Mother\u2019s arrest.\u201d The\n\ncase then proceeded to disposition. The disposition entry, also filed on August 1, 2018,\n\nplaced K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. in the legal custody of Custodians.\n\n      {\u00b65}   Mother filed a motion for change of custody and/or motion for visitation with\n\nregards to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. on December 28, 2018. SCDJFS filed a complaint\n\nwith regards to L.B. in February of 2019 a week after her birth. Mother tested positive for\n\nvarious substances during her pregnancy with L.B., including cocaine, marijuana, and\n\nmethamphetamines.\n\n      {\u00b66}   The trial court conducted a trial on Mother and Custodians\u2019 motions on\n\nSeptember 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020. The trial court also held an in-camera\n\ninterview of K.R.(2), as requested by Mother, on November 12, 2020.\n\n      {\u00b67}   Mother testified she lost her children in 2018 when her oldest child\n\nthreatened suicide.   Mother admitted she was addicted to methamphetamines from\n\nNovember of 2017 to March of 2018. She also admitted that, at the beginning of the case,\n\nshe misrepresented her substance abuse issues to SCDJFS. In 2017, M.B. pushed her\n\nand yelled at a lot. Both she and M.B. were abusing drugs. M.B. has a brain injury and\n\nsuffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from being the military. After Mother lost the\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      4\n\n\nchildren, she went to Florida to be with her mother. She used cocaine in July of 2018.\n\nWhen her brother overdosed in Ohio, she returned for several months, but then returned\n\nto Florida. Mother returned to Ohio to stay in February of 2019.\n\n       {\u00b68}   Mother began counseling in 2018 and remains in counseling today for\n\ngrief/trauma issues and drug abuse. Mother completed drug screens several times per\n\nweek and stated she was negative every time. Mother described her Vyvanse and\n\nAdderall medications, and stated she informed SCDJFS when those prescriptions\n\nchanged.\n\n       {\u00b69}   Mother stated she has complied with her case plan. Mother testified she is\n\ncurrently working, taking care of a hospice patient. Mother completed the Goodwill\n\nparenting program and is going through the home-based visitation program. She believes\n\nshe has done everything SCDJFS has asked of her to make the home appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b610} Mother also attends counseling with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2). Mother knows\n\nthat K.R.(1) is angry at her; however, Mother believes this anger is misplaced. Mother\n\nstated she is now clean and sober, and she has made significant changes in her life since\n\nshe lost custody of the children. She believes it is in the best interest of the children to\n\nbe returned to her care.\n\n       {\u00b611} On cross-examination, Mother confirmed there was a no-contact order\n\nbetween her and M.B. when she got pregnant with L.B.\n\n       {\u00b612} Jennifer Fire (\u201cFire\u201d) is the supervisor of the Goodwill parenting program.\n\nFire testified that Mother successfully completed the Goodwill parenting program;\n\nhowever, Mother failed on the individual goals portion of the program. Mother\u2019s home\n\nwas appropriate and, when Fire visited, Mother was utilizing the safety plan put in place\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    5\n\n\nby SCDJFS. Fire had concerns regarding Mother\u2019s substance abuse issues because,\n\nthroughout the program, Mother vacillated from accepting responsibility of that to\n\nminimizing it; Fire stated Mother never accepted full responsibility for her substance\n\nabuse problems, and blamed it on her ADHD and childhood trauma. Fire testified that\n\nMother minimized the impact that her substance abuse and domestic violence had on her\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b613} Nicole Hadden (\u201cHadden\u201d) is the ongoing caseworker for L.B. For both\n\nMother and M.B., their case plans required they complete parenting assessments,\n\ncomplete assessments at CommQuest, and follow any recommendations. M.B. complied\n\nwith the recommendations from his parenting evaluation, as he had to continue\n\ncounseling and medication services through the VA; comply with the orders of his\n\nprobation from his domestic violence conviction; and complete substance abuse\n\ntreatment. There were ongoing concerns with M.B. because his memory and mood\n\ndysregulation, and his questionable judgment related to a traumatic brain injury.\n\n       {\u00b614} Mother was required to comply with Summit Psychology for her medication\n\nand counseling, complete parenting classes, and attend joint counseling with M.B.\n\nMother initially was set up for the color code for approximately six months to monitor her\n\nfor illegal substances. Mother completed the parenting class, is in counseling each week,\n\nand completed the color code drug screens when asked.\n\n       {\u00b615} While Mother testified that she notified Hadden as soon as the doctor\n\nincreased her medication, Hadden stated that Mother advised her on June 9th by email\n\nthat she had a change in medication only after the aide had drug tested her that day. This\n\nconcerned Hadden with regards to Mother\u2019s long-term sobriety.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                       6\n\n\n       {\u00b616} When the home-based visits started, L.B. visited alone. However, when\n\nG.B. was added to the visits, Hadden testified that the clutter and things in the home that\n\nthey previously worked on getting rid of started to come back and it was difficult for Mother\n\nand M.B. to manage both children. Hadden knew the visits were difficult because of her\n\ninteractions with Mother and because Hadden supervised some of the visits herself. For\n\nexample, Mother\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic during the visits when both G.B.\n\nand L.B. were there.\n\n       {\u00b617} The GAL contacted Hadden after the review hearing in July of 2020,\n\nexpressing concern about Mother\u2019s appearance and behavior in court. Hadden wrote a\n\nletter to Mother\u2019s doctor about her concerns with Mother\u2019s medication. Based upon\n\nHadden\u2019s review of her notes and the records she received after Mother signed a release\n\nof information, it appeared that Mother was asking her doctor for Adderall. Mother\u2019s\n\ndoctor provided a letter to Hadden stating she is compliant with medication and he did not\n\nsee a concern prescribing Adderall.\n\n       {\u00b618} While Hadden believes the primary goal is reunification, she has concerns\n\nthat need to be addressed. Her concern for Mother\u2019s sobriety still remains, as does her\n\nconcern about Mother\u2019s dishonesty. Hadden testified that Mother has a history of being\n\ndishonest with her throughout the proceedings.\n\n       {\u00b619} Kristin Guardado is the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for all four children.\n\n       {\u00b620} K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) described to Guardado a life of chaos and anxiety,\n\nincluding watching Mother and M.B. do drugs and M.B. physically abuse Mother. K.R.(1)\n\nfelt it was her responsibility to care for G.B.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    7\n\n\n      {\u00b621} When Guardado first met K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), they were very thin, had\n\nextreme anxiety, and were very fearful Custodians would leave them. Both children talk\n\na lot about domestic violence between Mother and M.B. and their continual drug use.\n\nBoth children were very afraid to talk to anyone because Mother told them if they talked\n\nto people, Mother would go to jail. When K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) lived with Mother and M.B.\n\nprior to their removal, the house was filthy and the children were taking care of\n\nthemselves.    K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) had issues with school attendance.        K.R.(1) told\n\nGuardado that Mother permitted her half-brother to live in the home, despite K.R.(1)\u2019s\n\nreporting to Mother that the half-brother abused her.\n\n      {\u00b622} K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) are doing very well with Custodians. When Mother\n\nstopped her visitation with them, their anxiety and physical issues substantially\n\ndecreased. They are doing well in school. Both have expressed fear at being returned\n\nto Mother\u2019s care, and they do not trust her. Both are afraid of M.B. due to his past acts\n\nof domestic violence against Mother. Guardado testified it would be detrimental for\n\nK.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to be returned to Mother. Guardado believes Custodians continue to\n\nfacilitate a relationship between Mother and the children. However, Guardado believes\n\nthe two children should not be around M.B. until the counselor feels it is appropriate.\n\nGuardado thinks legal custody to Custodians is in the best interest of both children.\n\n      {\u00b623} On cross-examination, Guardado confirmed Mother has completed portions\n\nof her case plan. However, Guardado stated the children still have issues, and some of\n\nthe concerns arising at the beginning of the case with regards to Mother and M.B. still\n\ncontinue on.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                       8\n\n\n       {\u00b624} The trial court also admitted Guardado\u2019s August 2020 report into evidence.\n\nShe believes it is in the best interest of the children for: (1) Custodians to maintain legal\n\ncustody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.; (2) Custodians to be granted legal custody of L.B.;\n\n(3) Mother\u2019s motions to terminate and return to be denied; (4) Mother to continue to\n\nparticipate in therapeutic visits with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2); (5) K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to not be\n\naround M.B. until their counselor feels it is appropriate; (6) Mother and M.B. to have\n\nweekly 2-hour visits with L.B. and G.B.; and (7) M.B. not to be left unsupervised with the\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b625} Guardado reports that the children are thriving in their current home. They\n\nare all very close.\n\n       {\u00b626} Guardado included many details in her report, but concluded that she has\n\nconcerns about returning any of the children to Mother. This is due to Mother and M.B.\u2019s\n\ndishonesty throughout the case and their inability to take responsibility for their actions\n\nand instead blame others. Guardado stated the parties failed to alleviate the risks that\n\nwere present at the time of the removal.\n\n       {\u00b627} Amanda Van Buren (\u201cVan Buren\u201d) is a family coach at Goodwill parenting\u2019s\n\nhome-based parenting program. She works with Mother and M.B. weekly.\n\n       {\u00b628} Van Buren stated the visits with G.B. and L.B. are inconsistent. While some\n\nvisits go smoothly, sometimes Mother would rather discuss her own issues instead of\n\nspending time with the children. Initially, Van Buren and Mother addressed some safety\n\nconcerns in the home. Van Buren recently had to address some issues in the home in\n\nJuly. Van Burden also stated there are times where Mother and M.B. failed to adequately\n\nsupervise the children. Van Buren testified Mother\u2019s behavior is inconsistent, and has\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                        9\n\n\nbecome more erratic since July. Her main concerns regarding the safety of the children\n\nare: consistent demeanor, ability to supervise the children, and substance abuse.\n\n       {\u00b629} Jessica Skrzypiec (\u201cSkrzypiec\u201d) is a licensed clinician who did an\n\nassessment on Mother and continues to be her counselor.                Her diagnoses were\n\nadjustment disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Mother was not truthful\n\nduring her initial assessment about her substance abuse. However, during treatment in\n\nMarch of 2019, Mother admitted abusing her prescription Adderall. Skrzypiec stated\n\nMother\u2019s treatment has progressed well and she is not currently worried about Mother\n\nabusing medication because Mother has done well and has done everything Skrzypiec\n\nhas asked her to do.\n\n       {\u00b630} On cross-examination, Skrzypiec confirmed that on August 28, 2020 Mother\n\nwas very upset because she lost her job. However, Mother testified on September 1,\n\n2020 that she was still employed; thus, Mother lied to the court.\n\n       {\u00b631} R.R. is the current custodian of the children and has been since February\n\nof 2018. R.R. will follow any orders of the court with regards to this case. R.R. believes\n\nit is in the best interest of the children for R.R. and her husband to have legal custody of\n\nthe children, but also believes that Mother should have a relationship with G.B. and L.B.\n\nWith regards to visitation with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), R.R. defers to the children\u2019s counselor\n\nas to when that is appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b632} The trial court issued an extensive judgment entry on March 15, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b633} The trial court found the GAL\u2019s testimony credible and noted it took her\n\nreport into consideration in its decision. Additionally, the trial court stated it agreed with\n\nthe concerns reported by the GAL.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    10\n\n\n       {\u00b634} The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony questionable. As the first day of\n\ntrial progressed, \u201cMother\u2019s testimony became more garbled and lacking in a clear\n\ndirection. It was as if Mother placed some marbles or cotton in her mouth during the\n\nbreak session. Her recollection of events, especially as to time, degraded throughout\n\ncross-examination.\u201d The trial court cited several specific portions of Mother\u2019s direct and\n\ncross-examination to illustrate its point.\n\n       {\u00b635} The trial court found the credible testimony and the in-camera interview with\n\nK.R.(2) clearly establish that K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. were subjected to extremely\n\ntraumatic events while living with Mother, including missing meals, witnessing domestic\n\nviolence, witnessing drug abuse, suffering sexual abuse, and having their educational\n\nneeds neglected. However, Mother continues to deny or downplay this trauma, and even\n\ntestified that her children\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d changed, questioning their credibility.\n\n       {\u00b636} The trial court found the credible evidence bolstered the following concerns\n\nof the GAL: that Mother has not been truthful throughout the case; that Mother does not\n\naccept responsibility for the traumatic experiences of her children; and Mother continues\n\nto use excuses. Though Mother testified she is \u201cin a different place completely\u201d than\n\nbefore, the trial court stated the balance of the testimony does not support Mother\u2019s\n\nassertion.\n\n       {\u00b637} The trial court determined the evidence demonstrates Mother is not\n\nadequately able to supervise the children. For example, Fire testified Mother failed in her\n\nindividual goals and she still had concerns about Mother because of her drug use.\n\nFurther, Van Buren gave credible testimony that M.B. continues to have issues in\n\ndiscussing his triggers, and the visits with Mother and M.B. were inconsistent, and during\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      11\n\n\none visit, G.B. escaped from the home because the door was not locked and she was not\n\nbeing adequately watched. The trial court also noted Skrzypiec\u2019s testimony that Mother\n\nwas dishonest about her substance abuse, and that Mother is frequently overwhelmed.\n\n       {\u00b638} The trial court found Mother is not suitable to care for any of the children at\n\nthis time. Further, the credible evidence establishes that R.R. and T.R. are capable and\n\nwilling to care for and support all four of the children, and put the best interest of the\n\nchildren ahead of their own interests.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court then did an extensive review of the relevant best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a-j), and addressed them as follows: (a) Mother\n\ntestified she wants legal custody of all four children; however, the court questioned the\n\nsincerity of this request; (b) the interview with K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of the GAL\n\nand did not support Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wanted to live with her; (c) the children\n\nare bonded with each other and bonded to R.R. and T.R., while there is no healthy bond\n\nbetween the children and Mother; (d) the children are doing well in the home of\n\nCustodians, as this is a safe, loving, and healthy environment; however, Mother could not\n\nmeet the emotional, educational, or basic needs of the children and there is a legitimate\n\nconcern that the return of any of the children to her would place them at risk physically\n\nand emotionally; (e) M.B. is 100% disabled due to a traumatic brain injury, is not able to\n\ncare for any of the children, and has committed acts against Mother in the past; Mother\n\nand M.B. have used drugs; Mother\u2019s presentation in court was \u201coff\u201d and she appeared to\n\nbe suffering from some physical or mental ailment; Mother struggles with mental health\n\nstability and has trouble telling the truth; (f) Custodians appear most likely to facilitate\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      12\n\n\nvisitation; Mother did not follow orders in other cases and was not truthful with the GAL;\n\nand (g) Mother indicated child support is not current.\n\n       {\u00b640} The trial court concluded, upon review of the testimony presented and\n\nreview of the above-factors, it is in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) for Custodians\n\nto be granted legal custody. Further, it would not be in the best interest of K.R.(1) or\n\nK.R.(2) for Mother to be named their legal custodian.\n\n       {\u00b641} The trial court named R.R. and T.R. the legal custodians of K.R.(1) and\n\nK.R.(2), and denied Mother\u2019s motion for custody.\n\n       {\u00b642} Mother appeals the March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and assigns the following as error.\n\n       {\u00b643} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT\u2019S\n\nMOTION FOR A CHANGE OF LEGAL CUSTODY AND FOR A MOTION TO RETURN\n\nAND TERMINATE.\n\n       {\u00b644} \u201cII. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST\n\nWEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE AND VIOLATED MOTHER\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS.\u201d\n\n                                          Legal Custody\n\n       {\u00b645} The award of legal custody is \u201cnot as drastic a remedy as permanent\n\ncustody.\u201d In re L.D., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-985, 2013-Ohio-3214. This is because\n\nthe award of legal custody does not divest parents of their residual rights, privileges, and\n\nresponsibilities. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188.\n\n       {\u00b646} Before awarding legal custody to a non-parent, a trial court must ordinarily\n\nmake a finding that each parent is unsuitable. In re L.P., 5th Dist. Muskingum No.\n\nCT2016-0045, 2017-Ohio-52, citing In re Hockstock, 98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    13\n\n\nThis requirement does not apply, however, in cases involving abuse, neglect, or\n\ndependency. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that, \u201c[a] juvenile court adjudication\n\nof abuse, neglect, or dependency is a determination about the care and condition of a\n\nchild and implicitly involves a determination of the unsuitability of the child\u2019s custodial\n\nand/or noncustodial parents.\u201d In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843\n\nN.E.2d 1188. Thus, \u201c[w]hen a juvenile court adjudicates a child to be abused, neglected,\n\nor dependent, it has no duty to make a separate finding at the dispositional hearing that\n\na noncustodial parent is unsuitable before awarding legal custody to a nonparent.\u201d Id.\n\n      {\u00b647} In this case, both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) were adjudicated dependent.\n\n      {\u00b648} R.C. 2151.353(A) states, in pertinent part,\n\n      If a child is adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the court\n\n      may make any of the following orders of disposition:\n\n                                           ***\n\n      (3) Award legal custody of the child to either parent or to any other person\n\n      who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal\n\n      custody of the child or is identified as a proposed legal custodian in a\n\n      complaint or motion filed prior to the dispositional hearing by any party to\n\n      the proceedings * * *.\n\n      {\u00b649} A trial court \u201cmust have wide latitude in considering all the evidence\u201d and a\n\ncustody decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.

As an appellate court, we neither weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility\n\nof the witnesses. Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                     14\n\n\ncredible evidence upon which the finder of fact could base its judgment. Cross Truck\n\nEquip. Co. v. The Joseph A. Jeffries Co., 5th Dist. Stark No. CA5758, 1982 WL 2911\n\n(Feb. 10, 1982). Accordingly, judgments supported by some competent and credible\n\nevidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed as being\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr., 54 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 279, 376 N.E.2d 578 (1978).\n\n       {\u00b650} Unlike in a permanent custody proceeding where a juvenile court\u2019s standard\n\nof review is by clear and convincing evidence, the standard of review in legal custody\n\nproceedings is a preponderance of the evidence.          In re S.D., 5th Dist. Stark Nos.\n\n2013CA0081, 2013CA0082, 2013-Ohio-5752.\n\n       {\u00b651} Issues relating to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given\n\nto the evidence are primarily for the trier of fact.

Deferring to the trial court on matters of credibility \u201cis\n\ncrucial in a child custody case, where there may be as much evidence in the parties\u2019\n\ndemeanor and attitude that does not translate to the record well.\u201d Davis v.

Mother argues she completed her case plan services, has\n\nemployment, and is medically compliant. She also contends the trial court\u2019s finding it was\n\nin the best interest of the children for Custodians to be awarded custody was against the\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                          15\n\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence because she was bonded to the children and completed\n\nher case plan.\n\n       {\u00b653} We disagree with Mother.\n\n       {\u00b654} The statutory scheme regarding an award of legal custody does not include\n\na specific test or set of criteria, and a trial court must base its decision on the best interest\n\nof the child. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188; In re\n\nP.S., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00007, 2012-Ohio-3431. When determining the issue of\n\nlegal custody, the trial court should consider the totality of the circumstances. In re D.T.,\n\n5th Dist. Stark No. 2013CA00252, 2014-Ohio-2495. Trial courts should consider all\n\nfactors relevant to the best interest of the child. Id. This may include the best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 2151.414(D) and/or R.C. 3109.4(F), including: the wishes of\n\nthe child (expressed to the court or through the GAL) and the child\u2019s parents; the child\u2019s\n\ninteractions and interrelationship with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, and any other person\n\nwho may significantly affect the child; the custodial history of the child; the child\u2019s need\n\nfor a legally secure placement; the child\u2019s adjustment to their home, school, and\n\ncommunity; the mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation; and\n\nthe person more likely facilitate court-approved parenting time rights or visitation.\n\n       {\u00b655} Mother contends she has completed all her case plan requirements.\n\nHowever, the successful completion of a case plan is not dispositive on the issue of\n\nreunification. In re W.A.J., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99813, 2014-Ohio-604. While it may\n\nbe in Mother\u2019s best interest to complete the case plan, this is only one factor for a trial\n\ncourt to consider what is in the best interest of the child, and, \u201cin legal custody cases, trial\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      16\n\n\ncourts should consider all factors relevant to the best interest of the child.\u201d In the Matter\n\nof D.P. and G.P., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2010CA00348, 2011-Ohio-1907.\n\n       {\u00b656} Where a parent has participated in his or her case plan and completed most\n\nor all of the plan requirements, a trial court may still properly determine that such parent\n\nhas not substantially remedied the problems leading to agency involvement. In the Matter\n\nof A.L. and J.L., 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 11 CA 23, 2012-Ohio-481. In this case, the GAL\n\ntestified that while Mother has substantially completed her case plan, Mother failed to\n\nalleviate the risks present at the time of removal and the same concerns present at the\n\nbeginning of the case still continue today.\n\n       {\u00b657} The issue in this case is whether the preponderance of the evidence\n\ndemonstrated it was in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians. The trial court issued a detailed, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis as to\n\nwhy it determined it was in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to grant legal custody\n\nto Custodians and deny Mother\u2019s motions.          Further, though Mother contends she\n\nsubstantially remedied any problems leading to agency involvement, the testimony and\n\nevidence presented at the hearing do not support this conclusion.\n\n       {\u00b658} We find the determination by the trial court is supported by competent and\n\ncredible evidence.\n\n       {\u00b659} Mother had no contact with K.R.(1) or K.R.(2) for an extended period of\n\ntime while she was in Florida. Fire has continued concerns about Mother\u2019s substance\n\nabuse because she never accepted responsibility, and instead blamed it on her medical\n\nconditions and/or childhood trauma. Hadden similarly has concerns that remain about\n\nMother\u2019s long-term sobriety, particularly due to the Mother\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      17\n\n\nthroughout the proceedings. The GAL also has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s\n\nsobriety because of her recent jumpy and inappropriate appearance.              Van Buren\n\ndescribed Mother\u2019s behavior as inconsistent throughout the case, and more erratic since\n\nJuly. Van Buren has concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse. The trial court found\n\nMother\u2019s testimony about her remedying of concerns to not be credible and stated\n\nMother\u2019s testimony was garbled, lacked direction, and her recollection was not clear.\n\n       {\u00b660} Hadden and the GAL testified to Mother\u2019s dishonesty and inability to take\n\nresponsibility for her actions throughout the proceedings, and stated she had not\n\nremedied these concerns. Skrzypiec confirmed Mother initially lied to her about her\n\nsubstance abuse and lied to the court about her employment.\n\n       {\u00b661} Additionally, multiple witnesses had concerns about the visits K.R.(1) and\n\nK.R.(2)\u2019s younger siblings had with Mother. Hadden stated it was difficult for Mother to\n\nmanage both children. The GAL stated Mother could do short visits with G.B. and L.B.,\n\nbut could not manage them full-time. Van Buren stated the visits were inconsistent, and\n\nshe had concerns about both Mother and M.B.\u2019s ability to supervise the children.\n\n       {\u00b662} The GAL testified it is in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) for legal\n\ncustody to be granted to Custodians. Both have expressed fear about being returned to\n\nMother\u2019s care, and they do not trust her. When Mother stopped her visitation with them,\n\ntheir anxiety and physical issues substantially decreased. Both are afraid of M.B. due to\n\nhis past acts of domestic violence against Mother.          Guardado stated it would be\n\ndetrimental for K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to be returned to Mother, and believes Custodians will\n\ncontinue to facilitate a relationship between Mother and the children. However, Guardado\n\nbelieves the two children should not around M.B. until the counselor feels it is appropriate.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                         18\n\n\nGuardado testified that while Mother has worked hard, she is unable to appropriately\n\nparent. The interview of K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of Guardado and does not\n\nsupport Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wants to live with her.\n\n       {\u00b663} Guardado testified K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) are doing very well with Custodians.\n\nHadden describes Custodians as loving, cooperative, attentive, and bonded to the\n\nchildren. Further, G.B., L.B., K.R.(1), and K.R.(2) are very bonded to each other.\n\n       {\u00b664} Mother also claims the trial court did not consider the testimony about her\n\ngood visits, her continued counseling, and case plan compliance in its decision. However,\n\nwhile there was testimony about her case plan compliance and several good visits, there\n\nwas also testimony by multiple witnesses that the visits were inconsistent and many\n\nconcerns still remained. As this Court has previously stated, the trial court may believe\n\nall, part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it. Rogers v. Hill,\n\n124 Ohio App.3d 468, 706 N.E.2d 438 (4th Dist. 1998). Further, as discussed above,\n\nMother\u2019s compliance with her case plan is only one factor to consider in the best interest\n\ndetermination.\n\n                                            Due Process\n\n       {\u00b665} In the title of her second assignment of error, Mother asserts the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision violated her due process rights. However, Mother makes no argument in the\n\nbody of her brief as to how or why her due process rights were violated.\n\n       {\u00b666} \u201cIf an argument exists that can support [an] assignment of error, it is not this\n\ncourt\u2019s duty to root it out.\u201d Thomas v.

Cuyahoga No. 90512, 2008-Ohio-4368. \u201cIt\n\nis not the function of this court to construct a foundation for [an appellant\u2019s] claims; failure\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      19\n\n\nto comply with the rules governing practice in the appellate courts is a tactic which is\n\nordinarily fatal.\u201d Catanzarite v.

M.B. is the father of Mother\u2019s\n\ntwo younger children, G.B. and L.B. The father of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) is deceased. R.R.\n\nand T.R. (\u201cCustodians\u201d) are the paternal aunt and uncle of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2).\n\n      {\u00b63}   On May 10, 2018, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and\n\nG.B. were dependent, neglected, and abused children. The complaint alleged as follows:\n\nSCDJFS received multiple referrals regarding the family dating back to October of 2017;\n\nthere were concerns about domestic violence in the home and concerns about substance\n\nabuse by both Mother and M.B.; there were reports that K.R.(1) was acting as the primary\n\ncaretaker for the younger children; school officials reported several incidents of concern;\n\nK.R.(1) sent a group text indicating she was going to commit suicide; SCDJFS contacted\n\nMobile Youth Crisis for K.R.(1); SCDJFS observed multiple adults coming out of the home\n\nwith large black trash bags; Mother denied substance abuse concerns, but refused to\n\ntake a drug test; K.R.(2) and G.B. had multiple observable scratches and bruises; Mother\n\nwas recently charged with OVI and possession of a controlled substance; M.B. was\n\nrecently convicted of domestic violence against Mother; both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) made\n\nmultiple concerning statements regarding events and inappropriate circumstances that\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                     3\n\n\noccurred while living with Mother and M.B.; and K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) repeatedly expressed\n\nconcern of returning to their prior home environment.\n\n      {\u00b64}   The magistrate held a shelter care hearing on May 11, 2018. On the same\n\nday, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. The trial\n\ncourt issued a judgment entry on August 1, 2018, finding K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\ndependent. Further, the court found \u201cMother was not available to care for the children as\n\nshe has absconded law enforcement and there are warrants out for Mother\u2019s arrest.\u201d The\n\ncase then proceeded to disposition. The disposition entry, also filed on August 1, 2018,\n\nplaced K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. in the legal custody of Custodians.\n\n      {\u00b65}   Mother filed a motion for change of custody and/or motion for visitation with\n\nregards to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. on December 28, 2018. SCDJFS filed a complaint\n\nwith regards to L.B. in February of 2019 a week after her birth. Mother tested positive for\n\nvarious substances during her pregnancy with L.B., including cocaine, marijuana, and\n\nmethamphetamines.\n\n      {\u00b66}   The trial court conducted a trial on Mother and Custodians\u2019 motions on\n\nSeptember 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020. The trial court also held an in-camera\n\ninterview of K.R.(2), as requested by Mother, on November 12, 2020.\n\n      {\u00b67}   Mother testified she lost her children in 2018 when her oldest child\n\nthreatened suicide.   Mother admitted she was addicted to methamphetamines from\n\nNovember of 2017 to March of 2018. She also admitted that, at the beginning of the case,\n\nshe misrepresented her substance abuse issues to SCDJFS. In 2017, M.B. pushed her\n\nand yelled at a lot. Both she and M.B. were abusing drugs. M.B. has a brain injury and\n\nsuffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from being the military. After Mother lost the\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      4\n\n\nchildren, she went to Florida to be with her mother. She used cocaine in July of 2018.\n\nWhen her brother overdosed in Ohio, she returned for several months, but then returned\n\nto Florida. Mother returned to Ohio to stay in February of 2019.\n\n       {\u00b68}   Mother began counseling in 2018 and remains in counseling today for\n\ngrief/trauma issues and drug abuse. Mother completed drug screens several times per\n\nweek and stated she was negative every time. Mother described her Vyvanse and\n\nAdderall medications, and stated she informed SCDJFS when those prescriptions\n\nchanged.\n\n       {\u00b69}   Mother stated she has complied with her case plan. Mother testified she is\n\ncurrently working, taking care of a hospice patient. Mother completed the Goodwill\n\nparenting program and is going through the home-based visitation program. She believes\n\nshe has done everything SCDJFS has asked of her to make the home appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b610} Mother also attends counseling with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2). Mother knows\n\nthat K.R.(1) is angry at her; however, Mother believes this anger is misplaced. Mother\n\nstated she is now clean and sober, and she has made significant changes in her life since\n\nshe lost custody of the children. She believes it is in the best interest of the children to\n\nbe returned to her care.\n\n       {\u00b611} On cross-examination, Mother confirmed there was a no-contact order\n\nbetween her and M.B. when she got pregnant with L.B.\n\n       {\u00b612} Jennifer Fire (\u201cFire\u201d) is the supervisor of the Goodwill parenting program.\n\nFire testified that Mother successfully completed the Goodwill parenting program;\n\nhowever, Mother failed on the individual goals portion of the program. Mother\u2019s home\n\nwas appropriate and, when Fire visited, Mother was utilizing the safety plan put in place\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    5\n\n\nby SCDJFS. Fire had concerns regarding Mother\u2019s substance abuse issues because,\n\nthroughout the program, Mother vacillated from accepting responsibility of that to\n\nminimizing it; Fire stated Mother never accepted full responsibility for her substance\n\nabuse problems, and blamed it on her ADHD and childhood trauma. Fire testified that\n\nMother minimized the impact that her substance abuse and domestic violence had on her\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b613} Nicole Hadden (\u201cHadden\u201d) is the ongoing caseworker for L.B. For both\n\nMother and M.B., their case plans required they complete parenting assessments,\n\ncomplete assessments at CommQuest, and follow any recommendations. M.B. complied\n\nwith the recommendations from his parenting evaluation, as he had to continue\n\ncounseling and medication services through the VA; comply with the orders of his\n\nprobation from his domestic violence conviction; and complete substance abuse\n\ntreatment. There were ongoing concerns with M.B. because his memory and mood\n\ndysregulation, and his questionable judgment related to a traumatic brain injury.\n\n       {\u00b614} Mother was required to comply with Summit Psychology for her medication\n\nand counseling, complete parenting classes, and attend joint counseling with M.B.\n\nMother initially was set up for the color code for approximately six months to monitor her\n\nfor illegal substances. Mother completed the parenting class, is in counseling each week,\n\nand completed the color code drug screens when asked.\n\n       {\u00b615} While Mother testified that she notified Hadden as soon as the doctor\n\nincreased her medication, Hadden stated that Mother advised her on June 9th by email\n\nthat she had a change in medication only after the aide had drug tested her that day. This\n\nconcerned Hadden with regards to Mother\u2019s long-term sobriety.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                       6\n\n\n       {\u00b616} When the home-based visits started, L.B. visited alone. However, when\n\nG.B. was added to the visits, Hadden testified that the clutter and things in the home that\n\nthey previously worked on getting rid of started to come back and it was difficult for Mother\n\nand M.B. to manage both children. Hadden knew the visits were difficult because of her\n\ninteractions with Mother and because Hadden supervised some of the visits herself. For\n\nexample, Mother\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic during the visits when both G.B.\n\nand L.B. were there.\n\n       {\u00b617} The GAL contacted Hadden after the review hearing in July of 2020,\n\nexpressing concern about Mother\u2019s appearance and behavior in court. Hadden wrote a\n\nletter to Mother\u2019s doctor about her concerns with Mother\u2019s medication. Based upon\n\nHadden\u2019s review of her notes and the records she received after Mother signed a release\n\nof information, it appeared that Mother was asking her doctor for Adderall. Mother\u2019s\n\ndoctor provided a letter to Hadden stating she is compliant with medication and he did not\n\nsee a concern prescribing Adderall.\n\n       {\u00b618} While Hadden believes the primary goal is reunification, she has concerns\n\nthat need to be addressed. Her concern for Mother\u2019s sobriety still remains, as does her\n\nconcern about Mother\u2019s dishonesty. Hadden testified that Mother has a history of being\n\ndishonest with her throughout the proceedings.\n\n       {\u00b619} Kristin Guardado is the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for all four children.\n\n       {\u00b620} K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) described to Guardado a life of chaos and anxiety,\n\nincluding watching Mother and M.B. do drugs and M.B. physically abuse Mother. K.R.(1)\n\nfelt it was her responsibility to care for G.B.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    7\n\n\n      {\u00b621} When Guardado first met K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), they were very thin, had\n\nextreme anxiety, and were very fearful Custodians would leave them. Both children talk\n\na lot about domestic violence between Mother and M.B. and their continual drug use.\n\nBoth children were very afraid to talk to anyone because Mother told them if they talked\n\nto people, Mother would go to jail. When K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) lived with Mother and M.B.\n\nprior to their removal, the house was filthy and the children were taking care of\n\nthemselves.    K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) had issues with school attendance.        K.R.(1) told\n\nGuardado that Mother permitted her half-brother to live in the home, despite K.R.(1)\u2019s\n\nreporting to Mother that the half-brother abused her.\n\n      {\u00b622} K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) are doing very well with Custodians. When Mother\n\nstopped her visitation with them, their anxiety and physical issues substantially\n\ndecreased. They are doing well in school. Both have expressed fear at being returned\n\nto Mother\u2019s care, and they do not trust her. Both are afraid of M.B. due to his past acts\n\nof domestic violence against Mother. Guardado testified it would be detrimental for\n\nK.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to be returned to Mother. Guardado believes Custodians continue to\n\nfacilitate a relationship between Mother and the children. However, Guardado believes\n\nthe two children should not be around M.B. until the counselor feels it is appropriate.\n\nGuardado thinks legal custody to Custodians is in the best interest of both children.\n\n      {\u00b623} On cross-examination, Guardado confirmed Mother has completed portions\n\nof her case plan. However, Guardado stated the children still have issues, and some of\n\nthe concerns arising at the beginning of the case with regards to Mother and M.B. still\n\ncontinue on.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                       8\n\n\n       {\u00b624} The trial court also admitted Guardado\u2019s August 2020 report into evidence.\n\nShe believes it is in the best interest of the children for: (1) Custodians to maintain legal\n\ncustody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.; (2) Custodians to be granted legal custody of L.B.;\n\n(3) Mother\u2019s motions to terminate and return to be denied; (4) Mother to continue to\n\nparticipate in therapeutic visits with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2); (5) K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to not be\n\naround M.B. until their counselor feels it is appropriate; (6) Mother and M.B. to have\n\nweekly 2-hour visits with L.B. and G.B.; and (7) M.B. not to be left unsupervised with the\n\nchildren.\n\n       {\u00b625} Guardado reports that the children are thriving in their current home. They\n\nare all very close.\n\n       {\u00b626} Guardado included many details in her report, but concluded that she has\n\nconcerns about returning any of the children to Mother. This is due to Mother and M.B.\u2019s\n\ndishonesty throughout the case and their inability to take responsibility for their actions\n\nand instead blame others. Guardado stated the parties failed to alleviate the risks that\n\nwere present at the time of the removal.\n\n       {\u00b627} Amanda Van Buren (\u201cVan Buren\u201d) is a family coach at Goodwill parenting\u2019s\n\nhome-based parenting program. She works with Mother and M.B. weekly.\n\n       {\u00b628} Van Buren stated the visits with G.B. and L.B. are inconsistent. While some\n\nvisits go smoothly, sometimes Mother would rather discuss her own issues instead of\n\nspending time with the children. Initially, Van Buren and Mother addressed some safety\n\nconcerns in the home. Van Buren recently had to address some issues in the home in\n\nJuly. Van Burden also stated there are times where Mother and M.B. failed to adequately\n\nsupervise the children. Van Buren testified Mother\u2019s behavior is inconsistent, and has\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                        9\n\n\nbecome more erratic since July. Her main concerns regarding the safety of the children\n\nare: consistent demeanor, ability to supervise the children, and substance abuse.\n\n       {\u00b629} Jessica Skrzypiec (\u201cSkrzypiec\u201d) is a licensed clinician who did an\n\nassessment on Mother and continues to be her counselor.                Her diagnoses were\n\nadjustment disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Mother was not truthful\n\nduring her initial assessment about her substance abuse. However, during treatment in\n\nMarch of 2019, Mother admitted abusing her prescription Adderall. Skrzypiec stated\n\nMother\u2019s treatment has progressed well and she is not currently worried about Mother\n\nabusing medication because Mother has done well and has done everything Skrzypiec\n\nhas asked her to do.\n\n       {\u00b630} On cross-examination, Skrzypiec confirmed that on August 28, 2020 Mother\n\nwas very upset because she lost her job. However, Mother testified on September 1,\n\n2020 that she was still employed; thus, Mother lied to the court.\n\n       {\u00b631} R.R. is the current custodian of the children and has been since February\n\nof 2018. R.R. will follow any orders of the court with regards to this case. R.R. believes\n\nit is in the best interest of the children for R.R. and her husband to have legal custody of\n\nthe children, but also believes that Mother should have a relationship with G.B. and L.B.\n\nWith regards to visitation with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), R.R. defers to the children\u2019s counselor\n\nas to when that is appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b632} The trial court issued an extensive judgment entry on March 15, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b633} The trial court found the GAL\u2019s testimony credible and noted it took her\n\nreport into consideration in its decision. Additionally, the trial court stated it agreed with\n\nthe concerns reported by the GAL.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                    10\n\n\n       {\u00b634} The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony questionable. As the first day of\n\ntrial progressed, \u201cMother\u2019s testimony became more garbled and lacking in a clear\n\ndirection. It was as if Mother placed some marbles or cotton in her mouth during the\n\nbreak session. Her recollection of events, especially as to time, degraded throughout\n\ncross-examination.\u201d The trial court cited several specific portions of Mother\u2019s direct and\n\ncross-examination to illustrate its point.\n\n       {\u00b635} The trial court found the credible testimony and the in-camera interview with\n\nK.R.(2) clearly establish that K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. were subjected to extremely\n\ntraumatic events while living with Mother, including missing meals, witnessing domestic\n\nviolence, witnessing drug abuse, suffering sexual abuse, and having their educational\n\nneeds neglected. However, Mother continues to deny or downplay this trauma, and even\n\ntestified that her children\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d changed, questioning their credibility.\n\n       {\u00b636} The trial court found the credible evidence bolstered the following concerns\n\nof the GAL: that Mother has not been truthful throughout the case; that Mother does not\n\naccept responsibility for the traumatic experiences of her children; and Mother continues\n\nto use excuses. Though Mother testified she is \u201cin a different place completely\u201d than\n\nbefore, the trial court stated the balance of the testimony does not support Mother\u2019s\n\nassertion.\n\n       {\u00b637} The trial court determined the evidence demonstrates Mother is not\n\nadequately able to supervise the children. For example, Fire testified Mother failed in her\n\nindividual goals and she still had concerns about Mother because of her drug use.\n\nFurther, Van Buren gave credible testimony that M.B. continues to have issues in\n\ndiscussing his triggers, and the visits with Mother and M.B. were inconsistent, and during\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      11\n\n\none visit, G.B. escaped from the home because the door was not locked and she was not\n\nbeing adequately watched. The trial court also noted Skrzypiec\u2019s testimony that Mother\n\nwas dishonest about her substance abuse, and that Mother is frequently overwhelmed.\n\n       {\u00b638} The trial court found Mother is not suitable to care for any of the children at\n\nthis time. Further, the credible evidence establishes that R.R. and T.R. are capable and\n\nwilling to care for and support all four of the children, and put the best interest of the\n\nchildren ahead of their own interests.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court then did an extensive review of the relevant best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a-j), and addressed them as follows: (a) Mother\n\ntestified she wants legal custody of all four children; however, the court questioned the\n\nsincerity of this request; (b) the interview with K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of the GAL\n\nand did not support Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wanted to live with her; (c) the children\n\nare bonded with each other and bonded to R.R. and T.R., while there is no healthy bond\n\nbetween the children and Mother; (d) the children are doing well in the home of\n\nCustodians, as this is a safe, loving, and healthy environment; however, Mother could not\n\nmeet the emotional, educational, or basic needs of the children and there is a legitimate\n\nconcern that the return of any of the children to her would place them at risk physically\n\nand emotionally; (e) M.B. is 100% disabled due to a traumatic brain injury, is not able to\n\ncare for any of the children, and has committed acts against Mother in the past; Mother\n\nand M.B. have used drugs; Mother\u2019s presentation in court was \u201coff\u201d and she appeared to\n\nbe suffering from some physical or mental ailment; Mother struggles with mental health\n\nstability and has trouble telling the truth; (f) Custodians appear most likely to facilitate\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                      12\n\n\nvisitation; Mother did not follow orders in other cases and was not truthful with the GAL;\n\nand (g) Mother indicated child support is not current.\n\n       {\u00b640} The trial court concluded, upon review of the testimony presented and\n\nreview of the above-factors, it is in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) for Custodians\n\nto be granted legal custody. Further, it would not be in the best interest of K.R.(1) or\n\nK.R.(2) for Mother to be named their legal custodian.\n\n       {\u00b641} The trial court named R.R. and T.R. the legal custodians of K.R.(1) and\n\nK.R.(2), and denied Mother\u2019s motion for custody.\n\n       {\u00b642} Mother appeals the March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and assigns the following as error.\n\n       {\u00b643} \u201cI.

In this case, the GAL\n\ntestified that while Mother has substantially completed her case plan, Mother failed to\n\nalleviate the risks present at the time of removal and the same concerns present at the\n\nbeginning of the case still continue today.\n\n       {\u00b657} The issue in this case is whether the preponderance of the evidence\n\ndemonstrated it was in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians. The trial court issued a detailed, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis as to\n\nwhy it determined it was in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to grant legal custody\n\nto Custodians and deny Mother\u2019s motions.          Further, though Mother contends she\n\nsubstantially remedied any problems leading to agency involvement, the testimony and\n\nevidence presented at the hearing do not support this conclusion.\n\n       {\u00b658} We find the determination by the trial court is supported by competent and\n\ncredible evidence.\n\n       {\u00b659} Mother had no contact with K.R.(1) or K.R.(2) for an extended period of\n\ntime while she was in Florida.

The GAL also has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s\n\nsobriety because of her recent jumpy and inappropriate appearance.              Van Buren\n\ndescribed Mother\u2019s behavior as inconsistent throughout the case, and more erratic since\n\nJuly. Van Buren has concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse. The trial court found\n\nMother\u2019s testimony about her remedying of concerns to not be credible and stated\n\nMother\u2019s testimony was garbled, lacked direction, and her recollection was not clear.\n\n       {\u00b660} Hadden and the GAL testified to Mother\u2019s dishonesty and inability to take\n\nresponsibility for her actions throughout the proceedings, and stated she had not\n\nremedied these concerns. Skrzypiec confirmed Mother initially lied to her about her\n\nsubstance abuse and lied to the court about her employment.\n\n       {\u00b661} Additionally, multiple witnesses had concerns about the visits K.R.(1) and\n\nK.R.(2)\u2019s younger siblings had with Mother. Hadden stated it was difficult for Mother to\n\nmanage both children. The GAL stated Mother could do short visits with G.B. and L.B.,\n\nbut could not manage them full-time. Van Buren stated the visits were inconsistent, and\n\nshe had concerns about both Mother and M.B.\u2019s ability to supervise the children.\n\n       {\u00b662} The GAL testified it is in the best interest of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) for legal\n\ncustody to be granted to Custodians. Both have expressed fear about being returned to\n\nMother\u2019s care, and they do not trust her. When Mother stopped her visitation with them,\n\ntheir anxiety and physical issues substantially decreased. Both are afraid of M.B. due to\n\nhis past acts of domestic violence against Mother.          Guardado stated it would be\n\ndetrimental for K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to be returned to Mother, and believes Custodians will\n\ncontinue to facilitate a relationship between Mother and the children. However, Guardado\n\nbelieves the two children should not around M.B. until the counselor feels it is appropriate.\n\fStark County, Case No. 2021 CA 00037 & 2021 CA 00038                                         18\n\n\nGuardado testified that while Mother has worked hard, she is unable to appropriately\n\nparent. The interview of K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of Guardado and does not\n\nsupport Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wants to live with her.\n\n       {\u00b663} Guardado testified K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) are doing very well with Custodians.\n\nHadden describes Custodians as loving, cooperative, attentive, and bonded to the\n\nchildren. Further, G.B., L.B., K.R.(1), and K.R.(2) are very bonded to each other.\n\n       {\u00b664} Mother also claims the trial court did not consider the testimony about her\n\ngood visits, her continued counseling, and case plan compliance in its decision. However,\n\nwhile there was testimony about her case plan compliance and several good visits, there\n\nwas also testimony by multiple witnesses that the visits were inconsistent and many\n\nconcerns still remained.

(\u201cMother\u201d) is the Mother of four children. Father M.B. (\u201cM.B.\u201d) is the\n\nFather of G.B., born on August 31, 2015, and L.B., born on February 18, 2019. The father\n\nof Mother\u2019s two older children, K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), is deceased.            R.R. and T.R.\n\n(\u201cCustodians\u201d) are the paternal aunt and uncle of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2).\n\n       {\u00b63}   On May 10, 2018, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and\n\nG.B. were dependent, neglected, and abused children. The complaint alleged as follows:\n\nSCDJFS received multiple referrals regarding the family dating back to October of 2017;\n\nthere were concerns about domestic violence in the home and substance abuse by both\n\nparents; there were reports that K.R.(1) was acting as the primary caretaker for the\n\nyounger children; school officials reported several incidents of concern; K.R.(1) sent a\n\ngroup text indicating she was going to commit suicide; SCDJFS contacted Mobile Youth\n\nCrisis for K.R.(1); SCDJFS observed multiple adults coming out of the home with large\n\nblack trash bags; Mother denied substance abuse concerns, but refused to take a drug\n\ntest; K.R.(2) and G.B. had multiple observable scratches and bruises; Mother was\n\nrecently charged with OVI and possession of a controlled substance; Father was recently\n\nconvicted of domestic violence against Mother; both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) made multiple\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      3\n\n\nconcerning statements regarding events and inappropriate circumstances that occurred\n\nwhile living with Mother and Father; and K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) repeatedly expressed\n\nconcern of returning to their prior home environment.\n\n       {\u00b64}   The magistrate held a shelter care hearing on May 11, 2018. On the same\n\nday, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. The trial\n\ncourt issued a judgment entry on August 1, 2018, finding K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\ndependent. Further, the court found \u201cMother was not available to care for the children as\n\nshe has absconded law enforcement and there are warrants out for Mother\u2019s arrest.\u201d The\n\ncase then proceeded to disposition. The disposition entry, also filed on August 1, 2018,\n\nplaced K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. in the legal custody of Custodians.\n\n       {\u00b65}   Mother filed a motion for change of custody and/or motion for visitation with\n\nregards to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. on December 28, 2018.\n\n       {\u00b66}   On February 25, 2019, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging L.B. was a\n\ndependent and neglected child. The complaint alleged, in part, as follows: G.B., K.R.(1),\n\nand K.R.(2) are in the legal custody of relatives; the older children witnessed substance\n\nabuse by the parents and domestic violence between the parents; Mother tested positive\n\nfor various substances during her pregnancy with L.B., including cocaine, marijuana, and\n\nmethamphetamines; Mother stated at the hospital that she was going to live with her\n\ngrandfather, however, the number she provided to SCDJFS was not a working number;\n\nSCDJFS was unable to make contact with Mother again; and both Mother and Father\n\nhave a criminal history. On February 27, 2019, L.B. was placed in the temporary custody\n\nof SCDJFS.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       4\n\n\n       {\u00b67}   On March 20, 2019, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of L.B. Both\n\nMother and Father stipulated to a finding of dependency as to L.B.; SCDJFS deleted the\n\nallegations of neglect. The trial court issued a judgment entry on May 28, 2019, finding\n\nL.B. was a dependent child. L.B. was placed in the temporary custody of SCDJFS and\n\nSCDJFS placed her with Custodians.\n\n       {\u00b68}   SCDJFS filed a motion to extend temporary custody as to L.B. on both\n\nDecember 10, 2019 and July 21, 2020. Mother filed a motion to return L.B. to her and\n\nterminate the case with respect to L.B. on August 13, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b69}   The trial court conducted a trial on Mother and Custodians\u2019 motions on\n\nSeptember 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020. The trial court also held an in-camera\n\ninterview of K.R.(2), as requested by Mother, on November 12, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b610} Mother testified she lost her children in 2018 when her oldest daughter\n\nthreatened suicide.    Mother admitted she was addicted to methamphetamines from\n\nNovember of 2017 to March of 2018. She also admitted that, at the beginning of the case,\n\nshe misrepresented her substance abuse issues to SCDJFS. In 2017, Father pushed\n\nher and yelled at a lot. Both she and Father were abusing drugs. Father has a brain\n\ninjury and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from being the military. After Mother\n\nlost the children, she went to Florida to be with her mother. She used cocaine in July of\n\n2018. When her brother overdosed in Ohio, she returned for several months, but then\n\nreturned to Florida. Mother returned to Ohio to stay in February of 2019.\n\n       {\u00b611} Mother began counseling in 2018 and remains in counseling today for\n\ngrief/trauma issues and drug abuse. Mother completed drug screens several times per\n\nweek and stated she was negative every time. Mother described her Vyvanse and\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      5\n\n\nAdderall medications, and stated she informed SCDJFS when those prescriptions\n\nchanged.\n\n       {\u00b612} Mother stated she has complied with her case plan. Mother testified she is\n\ncurrently working, taking care of a hospice patient. Mother completed the Goodwill\n\nparenting program and is going through the home-based visitation program. She believes\n\nshe has done everything SCDJFS has asked of her to make the home appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b613} Mother also attends counseling with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2). Mother knows\n\nthat K.R.(1) is angry at her; however, Mother believes this anger is misplaced. Mother\n\nstated she is now clean and sober, and has made significant changes in her life since she\n\nlost custody of the children. She believes it is in the best interest of the children to be\n\nreturned to her care.\n\n       {\u00b614} On cross-examination, Mother confirmed there was a no-contact order\n\nbetween her and Father when she got pregnant with L.B.\n\n       {\u00b615} Jennifer Fire (\u201cFire\u201d) is the supervisor of the Goodwill parenting program.\n\nFire testified that Mother successfully completed the Goodwill parenting program;\n\nhowever, Mother failed on the individual goals portion of the program. Mother\u2019s home\n\nwas appropriate and, when Fire visited, Mother was utilizing the safety plan put in place\n\nby SCDJFS. Fire had concerns regarding Mother\u2019s substance abuse issues because,\n\nthroughout the program, Mother vacillated from accepting responsibility of that to\n\nminimizing it; Fire stated Mother never accepted full responsibility for her substance\n\nabuse problems, and blamed it on her ADHD and childhood trauma. Fire testified that\n\nMother minimized the impact that her substance abuse and domestic violence had on her\n\nchildren.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        6\n\n\n       {\u00b616} Rosemary Diamond (\u201cDiamond\u201d) supervised Mother\u2019s visits on September\n\n15 and February 29th between Mother and G.B. She felt the visits went well and Mother\n\nwas appropriate with G.B.\n\n       {\u00b617} K.M. is Father\u2019s mother. She supervised a visit between G.B., L.B., and\n\nMother and Father. She testified that Mother and Father were able to manage the\n\nchildren and G.B. did not want to leave. K.M. has not had any problem with access to\n\neither G.B. or L.B. while they have been in Custodians\u2019 care.\n\n       {\u00b618} Nicole Hadden (\u201cHadden\u201d) is the ongoing caseworker for L.B. For both\n\nMother and Father, their case plans required they complete parenting assessments,\n\ncomplete assessments at CommQuest, and follow any recommendations.                    Father\n\ncomplied with the recommendations from his parenting evaluation, as he had to continue\n\ncounseling and medication services through the VA; comply with the orders of his\n\nprobation from his domestic violence conviction; and complete substance abuse\n\ntreatment. Father was recommended for supervised visitation because of the ongoing\n\nconcerns with his memory and mood dysregulation, and his questionable judgment\n\nrelated to a traumatic brain injury.\n\n       {\u00b619} Mother was required to comply with Summit Psychology for her medication\n\nand counseling, complete parenting classes, and attend joint counseling with Father.\n\nMother initially was set up for the color code for approximately six months to monitor her\n\nfor illegal substances. Mother completed the parenting class, is in counseling each week,\n\nand completed the color code drug screens when asked.\n\n       {\u00b620} While Mother testified that she notified Hadden as soon as the doctor\n\nincreased her medication, Hadden stated that Mother advised her on June 9th by email\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        7\n\n\nthat she had a change in medication only after the aide had drug tested her that day. This\n\nconcerned Hadden with regards to Mother\u2019s long-term sobriety.\n\n       {\u00b621} When the home-based visits started, L.B. visited alone. However, when\n\nG.B. was added to the visits, Hadden testified that the clutter and things in the home that\n\nthey previously worked on getting rid of started to come back and it was difficult for Mother\n\nand Father to manage both children. Hadden knew the visits were difficult because of\n\nher interactions with Mother and because Hadden supervised some of the visits herself.\n\nFor example, Mother\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic during the visits when both\n\nG.B. and L.B. were there.\n\n       {\u00b622} The GAL contacted Hadden after the review hearing in July of 2020,\n\nexpressing concern about Mother\u2019s appearance and behavior in court. Hadden wrote a\n\nletter to Mother\u2019s doctor about her concerns with Mother\u2019s medication. Based upon\n\nHadden\u2019s review of her notes and the records she received after Mother signed a release\n\nof information, it appeared that Mother was asking her doctor for Adderall. Mother\u2019s\n\ndoctor provided a letter to Hadden stating she is compliant with medication and he did not\n\nsee a concern prescribing Adderall.\n\n       {\u00b623} While Hadden believes the primary goal is reunification, she has concerns\n\nthat need to be addressed. Her concern for Mother\u2019s sobriety still remains, as does her\n\nconcern about Mother\u2019s dishonesty. With regards to a six-month extension in custody,\n\nwhich would be the last one permissible, Hadden is concerned that would not be enough\n\ntime for her concerns about Mother to be eliminated, particularly due to the lack of\n\nrigorous and intensive substance abuse treatment. Hadden testified that Mother has a\n\nhistory of being dishonest with her throughout the proceedings.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      8\n\n\n       {\u00b624} Hadden believes it is in the best interest for Custodians to be granted legal\n\ncustody of L.B. Hadden has seen L.B. in their home. The home is busy, but Custodians\n\nare very attentive to the children and are meeting all of their needs. Custodians have\n\nbeen very cooperative with visitation for Mother and Father. L.B. is very bonded and\n\nattached to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\n       {\u00b625} Kristin Guardado is the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for all four children.\n\n       {\u00b626} Older siblings K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) described to the GAL a life of chaos and\n\nanxiety, including watching Mother and Father do drugs and Father physically abuse\n\nMother. K.R.(1) felt it was her responsibility to care for G.B. When Guardado first met\n\nG.B., G.B. would constantly scream. Guardado felt this happened because it was the\n\nonly way G.B. could get someone to take care of her. Guardado believes it would be\n\ndetrimental to G.B. to be returned to Mother and Father.\n\n       {\u00b627} As to L.B., Guardado recommends custody to Custodians, with short weekly\n\nvisits with Mother and Father. Her concerns about L.B. and G.B. being returned to Mother\n\nand Father include Mother continuing to lie and Mother\u2019s recent jumpy and inappropriate\n\nappearance.    Guardado testified Mother has worked hard; however, she unable to\n\nappropriately parent. For example, Mother suggested she would take L.B. to work with\n\nher all day instead of finding daycare or a babysitter. As to Father, he is unable to\n\nindependently parent.     Further, Mother and Father have \u201clied so many times and\n\nmisrepresented things it is hard to believe anything they say.\u201d Both of Mother\u2019s older\n\nchildren are afraid of Father due to his history of domestic violence against Mother. While\n\nGuardado thinks Mother can supervise L.B. for a short period of time, she cannot parent\n\nher full-time. Father cannot independently parent due to his PTSD and brain injury.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        9\n\n\n       {\u00b628} During the Goodwill parenting program, Mother and Father had visits with\n\nG.B. and L.B.     However, those were suspended in July of 2020 based upon the\n\nrecommendation of Guardado and because of the concerns expressed by the individuals\n\nsupervising the Goodwill parenting program.\n\n       {\u00b629} Guardado believes Custodians will continue to facilitate a relationship\n\nbetween Mother and the children. She believes it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B.\n\nfor Custodians to have legal custody, with Mother and Father having short weekly visits.\n\n       {\u00b630} On cross-examination, Guardado confirmed Mother has completed portions\n\nof her case plan. However, Guardado stated the children still have issues, and some of\n\nthe concerns present with Mother and Father at the beginning of the case still continue\n\non.\n\n       {\u00b631} The trial court also admitted Guardado\u2019s August 2020 report into evidence.\n\nShe believes it is in the best interest of the children for: (1) Custodians to maintain legal\n\ncustody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.; (2) Custodians to be granted legal custody of L.B.;\n\n(3) Mother\u2019s motions to terminate and return to be denied; (4) Mother to continue to\n\nparticipate in therapeutic visits with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2); (5) K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to not be\n\naround Father until their counselor feels it is appropriate; (6) Mother and Father to have\n\nweekly 2-hour visits with L.B. and G.B.; and (7) Father not to be left unsupervised with\n\nthe children.\n\n       {\u00b632} Guardado reports that the children are thriving in their current home. They\n\nare all very close.\n\n       {\u00b633} Guardado included many details in her report, but concluded that she has\n\nconcerns about returning any of the children to Mother. This is due to Mother and Father\u2019s\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     10\n\n\ndishonesty throughout the case and their inability to take responsibility for their actions\n\nand instead blame others. Guardado stated the parties failed to alleviate the risks that\n\nwere present at the time of the removal.\n\n       {\u00b634} Amanda Van Buren (\u201cVan Buren\u201d) is a family coach at Goodwill parenting\u2019s\n\nhome-based parenting program. She works with Mother and Father weekly. One of the\n\ngoals in the program to promote safety was for Mother and Father to move their bedroom\n\nup by L.B. Van Buren stated this was not Mother\u2019s idea, despite Mother\u2019s testimony that\n\nit was. Mother recently has been acknowledging her past triggers; however, Father has\n\nnot.\n\n       {\u00b635} Van Buren stated the visits are inconsistent. While some visits go smoothly,\n\nsometimes the parents would rather discuss their own issues instead of spending time\n\nwith the children. Initially, Van Buren and the parents addressed some safety concerns\n\nin the home. Van Buren recently had to address these same issues in the home in July.\n\nVan Burden also stated there are times where Mother and Father failed to adequately\n\nsupervise the children. Van Buren testified Mother\u2019s behavior is inconsistent, and has\n\nbecome more erratic since July. Her main concerns regarding the safety of the children\n\nare: consistent demeanor, ability to supervise the children, and substance abuse.\n\n       {\u00b636} Jessica Skrzypiec (\u201cSkrzypiec\u201d) is a licensed clinician who did an\n\nassessment on Mother and continues to be her counselor.               Her diagnoses were\n\nadjustment disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Mother was not truthful\n\nduring her initial assessment about her substance abuse. However, during treatment in\n\nMarch of 2019, Mother admitted abusing her prescription Adderall. Skrzypiec stated\n\nMother\u2019s treatment has progressed well and she is not currently worried about Mother\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        11\n\n\nabusing medication because Mother has done well and has done everything Skrzypiec\n\nhas asked her to do.\n\n       {\u00b637} On cross-examination, Skrzypiec confirmed that on August 28, 2020,\n\nMother was very upset because she lost her job. However, Mother testified on September\n\n1, 2020 that she was still employed; thus, Mother lied to the court.\n\n       {\u00b638} R.R. is the current custodian of the children and has been since February\n\nof 2018. R.R. will follow any orders of the court with regards to this case. R.R. believes\n\nit is in the best interest of the children for R.R. and her husband to have legal custody of\n\nthe children, but also believes that Mother should have a relationship with G.B. and L.B.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court issued an extensive judgment entry on March 15, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b640} The trial court found the GAL\u2019s testimony credible and noted it took her\n\nreport into consideration in its decision. Additionally, the trial court stated it agreed with\n\nthe concerns reported by the GAL.\n\n       {\u00b641} The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony questionable. As the first day of\n\ntrial progressed, \u201cMother\u2019s testimony became more garbled and lacking in a clear\n\ndirection. It was as if Mother placed some marbles or cotton in her mouth during the\n\nbreak session. Her recollection of events, especially as to time, degraded throughout\n\ncross-examination.\u201d The trial court cited several specific portions of Mother\u2019s direct and\n\ncross-examination to illustrate its point.\n\n       {\u00b642} The trial court found the credible testimony and the in-camera interview with\n\nK.R.(2) clearly establish that K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. were subjected to extremely\n\ntraumatic events while living with Mother, including missing meals, witnessing domestic\n\nviolence, witnessing drug abuse, suffering sexual abuse, and having their educational\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044         12\n\n\nneeds neglected. However, Mother continues to deny or downplay this trauma, and even\n\ntestified that her children\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d changed, questioning their credibility.\n\n       {\u00b643} The trial court found the credible evidence bolstered the following concerns\n\nof the GAL: that Mother has not been truthful throughout the case; that Mother does not\n\naccept responsibility for the traumatic experiences of her children; and Mother continues\n\nto use excuses. Though Mother testified she is \u201cin a different place completely\u201d than\n\nbefore, the trial court stated the balance of the testimony does not support Mother\u2019s\n\nassertion.\n\n       {\u00b644} The trial court determined the evidence demonstrates Mother and Father\n\nare not adequately able to supervise the children. For example, Fire testified Mother\n\nfailed in her individual goals and she still had concerns about Mother because of her drug\n\nuse and Father because of the domestic violence. Further, Van Buren gave credible\n\ntestimony that Father continues to have issues in discussing his triggers, and the visits\n\nwith Mother and Father were inconsistent, and during one visit, G.B. escaped from the\n\nhome because the door was not locked and she was not being adequately watched. The\n\ntrial court also noted Skrzypiec\u2019s testimony that Mother was dishonest about her\n\nsubstance abuse, and that Mother is frequently overwhelmed.\n\n       {\u00b645} The trial court found neither Mother nor Father are suitable to care for any\n\nof the children at this time, and the motion to extend is not in L.B.\u2019s best interest. Further,\n\nthe credible evidence establishes that R.R. and T.R. are capable and willing to care for\n\nand support all four of the children, and put the best interest of the children ahead of their\n\nown interests.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       13\n\n\n       {\u00b646} The trial court then did an extensive review of the relevant best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a-j), and addressed them as follows: (a) Mother\n\ntestified she wants legal custody of all four children; however, the court questioned the\n\nsincerity of this request; (b) the interview with K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of the GAL\n\nand did not support Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wanted to live with her; (c) the children\n\nare bonded with each other and bonded to R.R. and T.R., while there is no healthy bond\n\nbetween the children and either Mother or Father; (d) the children are doing well in the\n\nhome of Custodians, as this is a safe, loving, and healthy environment; however, neither\n\nMother and Father could meet the emotional, educational, or basic needs of the children\n\nand there is a legitimate concern that the return of any of the children to them would place\n\nthem at risk physically and emotionally; (e) Father is 100% disabled due to a traumatic\n\nbrain injury, is not able to care for any of the children, and has committed acts against\n\nMother in the past; Mother and Father have used drugs; Mother\u2019s presentation in court\n\nwas \u201coff\u201d and she appeared to be suffering from some physical or mental ailment; Mother\n\nstruggles with mental health stability and has trouble telling the truth; (f) Custodians\n\nappear most likely to facilitate visitation; Mother did not follow orders in other cases and\n\nwas not truthful with the GAL; and (g) Mother indicated child support is not current.\n\n       {\u00b647} The trial court concluded, upon review of the testimony presented and\n\nreview of the above-factors, it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to be\n\ngranted legal custody.\n\n       {\u00b648} Further, it would not be in the best interest of G.B. or L.B. for Mother to be\n\nnamed their legal custodian. Finally, it would not be in the best interest of L.B. to grant\n\nthe motion to extend.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044   14\n\n\n       {\u00b649} As to visitation, the trial court found it would be detrimental to allow any\n\nadditional visits with the children for Mother or Father other than as recommended by the\n\nGAL in her report.\n\n       {\u00b650} The trial court named R.R. and T.R. the legal custodians of G.B. and L.B.,\n\nand denied Mother\u2019s motions. The trial court also denied SCDJFS\u2019 motion to extend with\n\nregard to L.B.\n\n       {\u00b651} Mother appeals the March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and assigns the following as error.\n\n       {\u00b652} \u201cI.

THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST\n\nWEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE AND VIOLATED MOTHER\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b654} Father also appeals the March 15, 2021 judgment entry and assigns the\n\nfollowing as error:\n\n       {\u00b655} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN AWARDING LEGAL\n\nCUSTODY TO A NON-PARENT IN VIOLATION OF THE DICTATES OF IN RE\n\nPERALES, 52 OHIO ST.2D 89; O.R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) AND/OR 2151.414(D).\n\nTHEREFORE, SUCH DECISION WAS CONTRARY TO THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF\n\nTHE EVIDENCE.\u201d\n\n                                          Legal Custody\n\n       {\u00b656} The award of legal custody is \u201cnot as drastic a remedy as permanent\n\ncustody.\u201d In re L.D., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-985, 2013-Ohio-3214. This is because\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      15\n\n\nthe award of legal custody does not divest parents of their residual rights, privileges, and\n\nresponsibilities. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188.\n\n       {\u00b657} Before awarding legal custody to a non-parent, a trial court must ordinarily\n\nmake a finding that each parent is unsuitable. In re L.P., 5th Dist. Muskingum No.\n\nCT2016-0045, 2017-Ohio-52, citing In re Hockstock, 98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208.\n\nThis requirement does not apply, however, in cases involving abuse, neglect, or\n\ndependency. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that, \u201c[a] juvenile court adjudication\n\nof abuse, neglect, or dependency is a determination about the care and condition of a\n\nchild and implicitly involves a determination of the unsuitability of the child\u2019s custodial\n\nand/or noncustodial parents.\u201d In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843\n\nN.E.2d 1188. Thus, \u201c[w]hen a juvenile court adjudicates a child to be abused, neglected,\n\nor dependent, it has no duty to make a separate finding at the dispositional hearing that\n\na noncustodial parent is unsuitable before awarding legal custody to a nonparent.\u201d Id.\n\n       {\u00b658} In this case, both G.B. and L.B. were adjudicated dependent.\n\n       {\u00b659} R.C. 2151.353(A) states, in pertinent part,\n\n       If a child is adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the court\n\n       may make any of the following orders of disposition:\n\n              ***\n\n       (3) Award legal custody of the child to either parent or to any other person\n\n       who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal\n\n       custody of the child or is identified as a proposed legal custodian in a\n\n       complaint or motion filed prior to the dispositional hearing by any party to\n\n       the proceedings * * *.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      16\n\n\n       {\u00b660} A trial court \u201cmust have wide latitude in considering all the evidence\u201d and a\n\ncustody decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.

As an appellate court, we neither weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility\n\nof the witnesses. Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and\n\ncredible evidence upon which the finder of fact could base its judgment. Cross Truck\n\nEquip. Co. v. The Joseph A. Jeffries Co., 5th Dist. Stark No. CA5758, 1982 WL 2911\n\n(Feb. 10, 1982). Accordingly, judgments supported by some competent and credible\n\nevidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed as being\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr., 54 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 279, 376 N.E.2d 578 (1978).\n\n       {\u00b661} Unlike in a permanent custody proceeding where a juvenile court\u2019s standard\n\nof review is by clear and convincing evidence, the standard of review in legal custody\n\nproceedings is a preponderance of the evidence.          In re S.D., 5th Dist. Stark Nos.\n\n2013CA0081, 2013CA0082, 2013-Ohio-5752.\n\n       {\u00b662} Issues relating to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given\n\nto the evidence are primarily for the trier of fact.

Deferring to the trial court on matters of credibility \u201cis\n\ncrucial in a child custody case, where there may be as much evidence in the parties\u2019\n\ndemeanor and attitude that does not translate to the record well.\u201d Davis v.

Mother argues she completed her case plan services, has\n\nemployment, and is medically compliant. She also contends the trial court\u2019s finding it was\n\nin the best interest of the children for Custodians to be awarded custody was against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence because she was bonded to the children and completed\n\nher case plan. Father similarly argues the trial court\u2019s determination was against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence because Mother completed her case plan, and because\n\nboth Mother and Father made progress in remedying the conditions that led to the\n\nremoval of the children.\n\n       {\u00b664} We disagree with Mother and Father.\n\n       {\u00b665} The statutory scheme regarding an award of legal custody does not include\n\na specific test or set of criteria, and a trial court must base its decision on the best interest\n\nof the child. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188; In re\n\nP.S., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00007, 2012-Ohio-3431. When determining the issue of\n\nlegal custody, the trial court should consider the totality of the circumstances. In re D.T.,\n\n5th Dist. Stark No. 2013CA00252, 2014-Ohio-2495. Trial courts should consider all\n\nfactors relevant to the best interest of the child. Id. This may include the best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 2151.414(D) and/or R.C. 3109.4(F), including: the wishes of\n\nthe child (expressed to the court or through the GAL) and the child\u2019s parents; the child\u2019s\n\ninteractions and interrelationship with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, and any other person\n\nwho may significantly affect the child; the custodial history of the child; the child\u2019s need\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044         18\n\n\nfor a legally secure placement; the child\u2019s adjustment to their home, school, and\n\ncommunity; the mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation; and\n\nthe person more likely facilitate court-approved parenting time rights or visitation.\n\n       {\u00b666} Mother and Father contend that Mother has completed all her case plan\n\nrequirements. However, the successful completion of a case plan is not dispositive on\n\nthe issue of reunification. In re W.A.J., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99813, 2014-Ohio-604.\n\nWhile it may be in Mother\u2019s best interest to complete the case plan, this is only one factor\n\nfor a trial court to consider what is in the best interest of the child, and, \u201cin legal custody\n\ncases, trial courts should consider all factors relevant to the best interest of the child.\u201d In\n\nthe Matter of D.P. and G.P., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2010CA00348, 2011-Ohio-1907.\n\n       {\u00b667} Where a parent has participated in his or her case plan and completed most\n\nor all of the plan requirements, a trial court may still properly determine that such parent\n\nhas not substantially remedied the problems leading to agency involvement. In the Matter\n\nof A.L. and J.L., 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 11 CA 23, 2012-Ohio-481. In this case, the GAL\n\ntestified that while Mother has substantially completed her case plan, Mother failed to\n\nalleviate the risks present at the time of removal and the same concerns present at the\n\nbeginning of the case still continue today.\n\n       {\u00b668} The issue in this case is whether the preponderance of the evidence\n\ndemonstrated it was in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians. The trial court issued a detailed, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis as to\n\nwhy it determined it was in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians and deny Mother\u2019s motions. Further, though Mother and Father contend they\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044   19\n\n\nsubstantially remedied any problems leading to agency involvement, the testimony and\n\nevidence presented at the hearing do not support this conclusion.\n\n       {\u00b669} We find the determination by the trial court is supported by competent and\n\ncredible evidence.\n\n       {\u00b670} Mother had no contact with G.B. for an extended period of time while she\n\nwas in Florida. Fire has continued concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse because\n\nshe never accepted responsibility, and instead blamed it on her medical conditions and/or\n\nchildhood trauma. Hadden similarly has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s long-term\n\nsobriety, particularly due to the Mother\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior throughout the\n\nproceedings. The GAL also has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s sobriety because\n\nof her recent jumpy and inappropriate appearance.          Van Buren described Mother\u2019s\n\nbehavior as inconsistent throughout the case, and more erratic since July. Van Buren\n\nhas concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse. The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony\n\nabout her remedying of concerns to not be credible and stated Mother\u2019s testimony was\n\ngarbled, lacked direction, and her recollection was not clear.\n\n       {\u00b671} Hadden and the GAL testified to Mother\u2019s dishonesty and inability to take\n\nresponsibility for her actions throughout the proceedings, and stated she had not\n\nremedied these concerns. Skrzypiec confirmed Mother initially lied to her about her\n\nsubstance abuse and lied to the court about her employment.\n\n       {\u00b672} Additionally, multiple witnesses had concerns about the visits G.B. and L.B.\n\nhad with Mother and Father. Hadden stated it was difficult for Mother and Father to\n\nmanage both children. The GAL stated Mother could do short visits with G.B. and L.B.,\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       20\n\n\nbut could not manage them full-time. Van Buren stated the visits were inconsistent, and\n\nshe had concerns about both Mother and Father\u2019s ability to supervise the children.\n\n       {\u00b673} Father is 100% disabled, with a traumatic brain injury. The undisputed and\n\nunrebutted evidence from all witnesses in this case is that he cannot be left alone to\n\nparent the children.\n\n       {\u00b674} Hadden testified it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to\n\nbe granted legal custody. Hadden describes Custodians as loving, cooperative, attentive,\n\nand bonded to the children. Further, both G.B. and L.B. are very bonded to each other,\n\nand to their half-siblings, who also live with Custodians. The GAL testified that while\n\nMother has worked hard, she is unable to appropriately parent. G.B. and L.B. are thriving\n\nin Custodians\u2019 home, and they, along with their half-siblings, are very close. Thus, it is in\n\nthe best interest of both G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to be awarded legal custody, with\n\nMother and Father having short weekly visits.\n\n       {\u00b675} Mother also claims the trial court did not consider the testimony about her\n\ngood visits, her continued counseling, and case plan compliance in its decision. However,\n\nwhile there was testimony about her case plan compliance and several good visits, there\n\nwas also testimony by multiple witnesses that the visits were inconsistent and many\n\nconcerns still remained. As this Court has previously stated, the trial court may believe\n\nall, part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it. Rogers v. Hill,\n\n124 Ohio App.3d 468, 706 N.E.2d 438 (4th Dist. 1998). Further, as discussed above,\n\nMother\u2019s compliance with her case plan is only one factor to consider in the best interest\n\ndetermination.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     21\n\n\n                                       Six-Month Extension\n\n       {\u00b676} Mother argues the trial court committed error in denying SCDJFS\u2019 motion\n\nfor six-month extension. We disagree.\n\n       {\u00b677} A trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an extension of temporary custody\n\nis a discretionary one.       See R.C. 2151.415(D)(1) and (2).           Pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.415(D)(1), a trial court can extend temporary custody for six months only if it finds,\n\nby clear and convincing evidence, (1) that such extension is in the best interests of the\n\nchild, (2) that there has been significant progress on the case plan, and (3) that there is\n\nreasonable cause to believe that the child will be reunified with a parent or otherwise\n\npermanently placed within the period of extension.          See In re McNab., 5th Dist.\n\nTuscarawas Nos. 2007 AP 11 0074, 2007 AP 11 0075, 2008-Ohio-1638.\n\n       {\u00b678} While Mother has made significant progress on her case plan, as detailed\n\nabove, the concerns that existed at the beginning of the case still exist. Though the\n\nmotion was made by SCDJFS, Hadden testified she now believes it is in the best interest\n\nof L.B. for the motion to be denied and legal custody be granted to Custodians. This is\n\nbecause Hadden believes that a six-month extension is not enough time for her concerns\n\nabout Mother to be eliminated and there is not reasonable cause to believe L.B. will be\n\nreunified with Mother within six months, particularly due to the lack of rigorous and\n\nintensive substance abuse treatment.\n\n       {\u00b679}   As discussed above, the evidence before the trial court supports the\n\nconclusion that an extension of temporary custody was not in L.B.\u2019s best interest, but,\n\nrather, L.B.\u2019s interests were best served by award of legal custody to Custodians.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044          22\n\n\n                                            Due Process\n\n       {\u00b680} In the title of her second assignment of error, Mother asserts the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision violated her due process rights. However, Mother makes no argument in the\n\nbody of her brief as to how or why her due process rights were violated.\n\n       {\u00b681} \u201cIf an argument exists that can support [an] assignment of error, it is not this\n\ncourt\u2019s duty to root it out.\u201d Thomas v. Harmon, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 08CA17, 2009-\n\nOhio-3299, quoting State v. Carman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90512, 2008-Ohio-4368. \u201cIt\n\nis not the function of this court to construct a foundation for [an appellant\u2019s] claims; failure\n\nto comply with the rules governing practice in the appellate courts is a tactic which is\n\nordinarily fatal.\u201d Catanzarite v. Boswell, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24184, 2009-Ohio-1211.\n\nTherefore, \u201c[w]e may disregard any assignment of error that fails to present any citations\n\nto case law or statutes in support of its assertions.\u201d Frye v. Holzer Clinic, Inc., 4th Dist.\n\nGallia No. 07CA4, 2008-Ohio-2194; See also App.R. 16(A)(7); App.R. 12(A)(2); State v.\n\nNorman, 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 2010-CA-22, 2011-Ohio-596; State v. Untied, 5th Dist.\n\nMuskingum No. CT2006005, 2007-Ohio-1804.\n\n       {\u00b682} As pointed out by SCDJFS, Mother has made no argument to support this\n\nassertion, nor has she supported her allegations with references to the record or citations\n\nto authority to support a finding that the trial court violated her due process rights.\n\nAppellate Rule 16(A)(7) requires an appellant to include in his or her briefs, \u201c* * * [a]n\n\nargument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of\n\nerror presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions * * *.\u201d We may\n\nnot create an argument for Mother as to why her due process rights were violated. See\n\nState v. Carter, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2020-CA-0031, 2021-Ohio-358.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     23\n\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b683} Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not commit error in\n\nawarding legal custody of L.B. and G.B. to Custodians or in denying Mother\u2019s motion to\n\nreturn and terminate with regards to L.B. and G.B. Further, we find the trial court did not\n\ncommit error in denying the motion for six-month extension with regards to L.B.\n\n       {\u00b684} Accordingly, both Mother and Father\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       {\u00b685} The March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common\n\nPleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.\n\nBy Gwin, P.J.,\n\nWise, John, and\n\nWise, Earle J., concur\n\f\f",

(\u201cMother\u201d) is the Mother of four children. Father M.B. (\u201cM.B.\u201d) is the\n\nFather of G.B., born on August 31, 2015, and L.B., born on February 18, 2019. The father\n\nof Mother\u2019s two older children, K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), is deceased.            R.R. and T.R.\n\n(\u201cCustodians\u201d) are the paternal aunt and uncle of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2).\n\n       {\u00b63}   On May 10, 2018, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and\n\nG.B. were dependent, neglected, and abused children. The complaint alleged as follows:\n\nSCDJFS received multiple referrals regarding the family dating back to October of 2017;\n\nthere were concerns about domestic violence in the home and substance abuse by both\n\nparents; there were reports that K.R.(1) was acting as the primary caretaker for the\n\nyounger children; school officials reported several incidents of concern; K.R.(1) sent a\n\ngroup text indicating she was going to commit suicide; SCDJFS contacted Mobile Youth\n\nCrisis for K.R.(1); SCDJFS observed multiple adults coming out of the home with large\n\nblack trash bags; Mother denied substance abuse concerns, but refused to take a drug\n\ntest; K.R.(2) and G.B. had multiple observable scratches and bruises; Mother was\n\nrecently charged with OVI and possession of a controlled substance; Father was recently\n\nconvicted of domestic violence against Mother; both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) made multiple\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      3\n\n\nconcerning statements regarding events and inappropriate circumstances that occurred\n\nwhile living with Mother and Father; and K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) repeatedly expressed\n\nconcern of returning to their prior home environment.\n\n       {\u00b64}   The magistrate held a shelter care hearing on May 11, 2018. On the same\n\nday, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. The trial\n\ncourt issued a judgment entry on August 1, 2018, finding K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\ndependent. Further, the court found \u201cMother was not available to care for the children as\n\nshe has absconded law enforcement and there are warrants out for Mother\u2019s arrest.\u201d The\n\ncase then proceeded to disposition. The disposition entry, also filed on August 1, 2018,\n\nplaced K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. in the legal custody of Custodians.\n\n       {\u00b65}   Mother filed a motion for change of custody and/or motion for visitation with\n\nregards to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. on December 28, 2018.\n\n       {\u00b66}   On February 25, 2019, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging L.B. was a\n\ndependent and neglected child. The complaint alleged, in part, as follows: G.B., K.R.(1),\n\nand K.R.(2) are in the legal custody of relatives; the older children witnessed substance\n\nabuse by the parents and domestic violence between the parents; Mother tested positive\n\nfor various substances during her pregnancy with L.B., including cocaine, marijuana, and\n\nmethamphetamines; Mother stated at the hospital that she was going to live with her\n\ngrandfather, however, the number she provided to SCDJFS was not a working number;\n\nSCDJFS was unable to make contact with Mother again; and both Mother and Father\n\nhave a criminal history. On February 27, 2019, L.B. was placed in the temporary custody\n\nof SCDJFS.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       4\n\n\n       {\u00b67}   On March 20, 2019, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of L.B. Both\n\nMother and Father stipulated to a finding of dependency as to L.B.; SCDJFS deleted the\n\nallegations of neglect. The trial court issued a judgment entry on May 28, 2019, finding\n\nL.B. was a dependent child. L.B. was placed in the temporary custody of SCDJFS and\n\nSCDJFS placed her with Custodians.\n\n       {\u00b68}   SCDJFS filed a motion to extend temporary custody as to L.B. on both\n\nDecember 10, 2019 and July 21, 2020. Mother filed a motion to return L.B. to her and\n\nterminate the case with respect to L.B. on August 13, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b69}   The trial court conducted a trial on Mother and Custodians\u2019 motions on\n\nSeptember 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020. The trial court also held an in-camera\n\ninterview of K.R.(2), as requested by Mother, on November 12, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b610} Mother testified she lost her children in 2018 when her oldest daughter\n\nthreatened suicide.    Mother admitted she was addicted to methamphetamines from\n\nNovember of 2017 to March of 2018. She also admitted that, at the beginning of the case,\n\nshe misrepresented her substance abuse issues to SCDJFS. In 2017, Father pushed\n\nher and yelled at a lot. Both she and Father were abusing drugs. Father has a brain\n\ninjury and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from being the military. After Mother\n\nlost the children, she went to Florida to be with her mother. She used cocaine in July of\n\n2018. When her brother overdosed in Ohio, she returned for several months, but then\n\nreturned to Florida. Mother returned to Ohio to stay in February of 2019.\n\n       {\u00b611} Mother began counseling in 2018 and remains in counseling today for\n\ngrief/trauma issues and drug abuse. Mother completed drug screens several times per\n\nweek and stated she was negative every time. Mother described her Vyvanse and\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      5\n\n\nAdderall medications, and stated she informed SCDJFS when those prescriptions\n\nchanged.\n\n       {\u00b612} Mother stated she has complied with her case plan. Mother testified she is\n\ncurrently working, taking care of a hospice patient. Mother completed the Goodwill\n\nparenting program and is going through the home-based visitation program. She believes\n\nshe has done everything SCDJFS has asked of her to make the home appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b613} Mother also attends counseling with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2). Mother knows\n\nthat K.R.(1) is angry at her; however, Mother believes this anger is misplaced. Mother\n\nstated she is now clean and sober, and has made significant changes in her life since she\n\nlost custody of the children. She believes it is in the best interest of the children to be\n\nreturned to her care.\n\n       {\u00b614} On cross-examination, Mother confirmed there was a no-contact order\n\nbetween her and Father when she got pregnant with L.B.\n\n       {\u00b615} Jennifer Fire (\u201cFire\u201d) is the supervisor of the Goodwill parenting program.\n\nFire testified that Mother successfully completed the Goodwill parenting program;\n\nhowever, Mother failed on the individual goals portion of the program. Mother\u2019s home\n\nwas appropriate and, when Fire visited, Mother was utilizing the safety plan put in place\n\nby SCDJFS. Fire had concerns regarding Mother\u2019s substance abuse issues because,\n\nthroughout the program, Mother vacillated from accepting responsibility of that to\n\nminimizing it; Fire stated Mother never accepted full responsibility for her substance\n\nabuse problems, and blamed it on her ADHD and childhood trauma. Fire testified that\n\nMother minimized the impact that her substance abuse and domestic violence had on her\n\nchildren.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        6\n\n\n       {\u00b616} Rosemary Diamond (\u201cDiamond\u201d) supervised Mother\u2019s visits on September\n\n15 and February 29th between Mother and G.B. She felt the visits went well and Mother\n\nwas appropriate with G.B.\n\n       {\u00b617} K.M. is Father\u2019s mother. She supervised a visit between G.B., L.B., and\n\nMother and Father. She testified that Mother and Father were able to manage the\n\nchildren and G.B. did not want to leave. K.M. has not had any problem with access to\n\neither G.B. or L.B. while they have been in Custodians\u2019 care.\n\n       {\u00b618} Nicole Hadden (\u201cHadden\u201d) is the ongoing caseworker for L.B. For both\n\nMother and Father, their case plans required they complete parenting assessments,\n\ncomplete assessments at CommQuest, and follow any recommendations.                    Father\n\ncomplied with the recommendations from his parenting evaluation, as he had to continue\n\ncounseling and medication services through the VA; comply with the orders of his\n\nprobation from his domestic violence conviction; and complete substance abuse\n\ntreatment. Father was recommended for supervised visitation because of the ongoing\n\nconcerns with his memory and mood dysregulation, and his questionable judgment\n\nrelated to a traumatic brain injury.\n\n       {\u00b619} Mother was required to comply with Summit Psychology for her medication\n\nand counseling, complete parenting classes, and attend joint counseling with Father.\n\nMother initially was set up for the color code for approximately six months to monitor her\n\nfor illegal substances. Mother completed the parenting class, is in counseling each week,\n\nand completed the color code drug screens when asked.\n\n       {\u00b620} While Mother testified that she notified Hadden as soon as the doctor\n\nincreased her medication, Hadden stated that Mother advised her on June 9th by email\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        7\n\n\nthat she had a change in medication only after the aide had drug tested her that day. This\n\nconcerned Hadden with regards to Mother\u2019s long-term sobriety.\n\n       {\u00b621} When the home-based visits started, L.B. visited alone. However, when\n\nG.B. was added to the visits, Hadden testified that the clutter and things in the home that\n\nthey previously worked on getting rid of started to come back and it was difficult for Mother\n\nand Father to manage both children. Hadden knew the visits were difficult because of\n\nher interactions with Mother and because Hadden supervised some of the visits herself.\n\nFor example, Mother\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic during the visits when both\n\nG.B. and L.B. were there.\n\n       {\u00b622} The GAL contacted Hadden after the review hearing in July of 2020,\n\nexpressing concern about Mother\u2019s appearance and behavior in court. Hadden wrote a\n\nletter to Mother\u2019s doctor about her concerns with Mother\u2019s medication. Based upon\n\nHadden\u2019s review of her notes and the records she received after Mother signed a release\n\nof information, it appeared that Mother was asking her doctor for Adderall. Mother\u2019s\n\ndoctor provided a letter to Hadden stating she is compliant with medication and he did not\n\nsee a concern prescribing Adderall.\n\n       {\u00b623} While Hadden believes the primary goal is reunification, she has concerns\n\nthat need to be addressed. Her concern for Mother\u2019s sobriety still remains, as does her\n\nconcern about Mother\u2019s dishonesty. With regards to a six-month extension in custody,\n\nwhich would be the last one permissible, Hadden is concerned that would not be enough\n\ntime for her concerns about Mother to be eliminated, particularly due to the lack of\n\nrigorous and intensive substance abuse treatment. Hadden testified that Mother has a\n\nhistory of being dishonest with her throughout the proceedings.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      8\n\n\n       {\u00b624} Hadden believes it is in the best interest for Custodians to be granted legal\n\ncustody of L.B. Hadden has seen L.B. in their home. The home is busy, but Custodians\n\nare very attentive to the children and are meeting all of their needs. Custodians have\n\nbeen very cooperative with visitation for Mother and Father. L.B. is very bonded and\n\nattached to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\n       {\u00b625} Kristin Guardado is the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for all four children.\n\n       {\u00b626} Older siblings K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) described to the GAL a life of chaos and\n\nanxiety, including watching Mother and Father do drugs and Father physically abuse\n\nMother. K.R.(1) felt it was her responsibility to care for G.B. When Guardado first met\n\nG.B., G.B. would constantly scream. Guardado felt this happened because it was the\n\nonly way G.B. could get someone to take care of her. Guardado believes it would be\n\ndetrimental to G.B. to be returned to Mother and Father.\n\n       {\u00b627} As to L.B., Guardado recommends custody to Custodians, with short weekly\n\nvisits with Mother and Father. Her concerns about L.B. and G.B. being returned to Mother\n\nand Father include Mother continuing to lie and Mother\u2019s recent jumpy and inappropriate\n\nappearance.    Guardado testified Mother has worked hard; however, she unable to\n\nappropriately parent. For example, Mother suggested she would take L.B. to work with\n\nher all day instead of finding daycare or a babysitter. As to Father, he is unable to\n\nindependently parent.     Further, Mother and Father have \u201clied so many times and\n\nmisrepresented things it is hard to believe anything they say.\u201d Both of Mother\u2019s older\n\nchildren are afraid of Father due to his history of domestic violence against Mother. While\n\nGuardado thinks Mother can supervise L.B. for a short period of time, she cannot parent\n\nher full-time. Father cannot independently parent due to his PTSD and brain injury.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        9\n\n\n       {\u00b628} During the Goodwill parenting program, Mother and Father had visits with\n\nG.B. and L.B.     However, those were suspended in July of 2020 based upon the\n\nrecommendation of Guardado and because of the concerns expressed by the individuals\n\nsupervising the Goodwill parenting program.\n\n       {\u00b629} Guardado believes Custodians will continue to facilitate a relationship\n\nbetween Mother and the children. She believes it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B.\n\nfor Custodians to have legal custody, with Mother and Father having short weekly visits.\n\n       {\u00b630} On cross-examination, Guardado confirmed Mother has completed portions\n\nof her case plan. However, Guardado stated the children still have issues, and some of\n\nthe concerns present with Mother and Father at the beginning of the case still continue\n\non.\n\n       {\u00b631} The trial court also admitted Guardado\u2019s August 2020 report into evidence.\n\nShe believes it is in the best interest of the children for: (1) Custodians to maintain legal\n\ncustody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.; (2) Custodians to be granted legal custody of L.B.;\n\n(3) Mother\u2019s motions to terminate and return to be denied; (4) Mother to continue to\n\nparticipate in therapeutic visits with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2); (5) K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to not be\n\naround Father until their counselor feels it is appropriate; (6) Mother and Father to have\n\nweekly 2-hour visits with L.B. and G.B.; and (7) Father not to be left unsupervised with\n\nthe children.\n\n       {\u00b632} Guardado reports that the children are thriving in their current home. They\n\nare all very close.\n\n       {\u00b633} Guardado included many details in her report, but concluded that she has\n\nconcerns about returning any of the children to Mother. This is due to Mother and Father\u2019s\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     10\n\n\ndishonesty throughout the case and their inability to take responsibility for their actions\n\nand instead blame others. Guardado stated the parties failed to alleviate the risks that\n\nwere present at the time of the removal.\n\n       {\u00b634} Amanda Van Buren (\u201cVan Buren\u201d) is a family coach at Goodwill parenting\u2019s\n\nhome-based parenting program. She works with Mother and Father weekly. One of the\n\ngoals in the program to promote safety was for Mother and Father to move their bedroom\n\nup by L.B. Van Buren stated this was not Mother\u2019s idea, despite Mother\u2019s testimony that\n\nit was. Mother recently has been acknowledging her past triggers; however, Father has\n\nnot.\n\n       {\u00b635} Van Buren stated the visits are inconsistent. While some visits go smoothly,\n\nsometimes the parents would rather discuss their own issues instead of spending time\n\nwith the children. Initially, Van Buren and the parents addressed some safety concerns\n\nin the home. Van Buren recently had to address these same issues in the home in July.\n\nVan Burden also stated there are times where Mother and Father failed to adequately\n\nsupervise the children. Van Buren testified Mother\u2019s behavior is inconsistent, and has\n\nbecome more erratic since July. Her main concerns regarding the safety of the children\n\nare: consistent demeanor, ability to supervise the children, and substance abuse.\n\n       {\u00b636} Jessica Skrzypiec (\u201cSkrzypiec\u201d) is a licensed clinician who did an\n\nassessment on Mother and continues to be her counselor.               Her diagnoses were\n\nadjustment disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Mother was not truthful\n\nduring her initial assessment about her substance abuse. However, during treatment in\n\nMarch of 2019, Mother admitted abusing her prescription Adderall. Skrzypiec stated\n\nMother\u2019s treatment has progressed well and she is not currently worried about Mother\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        11\n\n\nabusing medication because Mother has done well and has done everything Skrzypiec\n\nhas asked her to do.\n\n       {\u00b637} On cross-examination, Skrzypiec confirmed that on August 28, 2020,\n\nMother was very upset because she lost her job. However, Mother testified on September\n\n1, 2020 that she was still employed; thus, Mother lied to the court.\n\n       {\u00b638} R.R. is the current custodian of the children and has been since February\n\nof 2018. R.R. will follow any orders of the court with regards to this case. R.R. believes\n\nit is in the best interest of the children for R.R. and her husband to have legal custody of\n\nthe children, but also believes that Mother should have a relationship with G.B. and L.B.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court issued an extensive judgment entry on March 15, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b640} The trial court found the GAL\u2019s testimony credible and noted it took her\n\nreport into consideration in its decision. Additionally, the trial court stated it agreed with\n\nthe concerns reported by the GAL.\n\n       {\u00b641} The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony questionable. As the first day of\n\ntrial progressed, \u201cMother\u2019s testimony became more garbled and lacking in a clear\n\ndirection. It was as if Mother placed some marbles or cotton in her mouth during the\n\nbreak session. Her recollection of events, especially as to time, degraded throughout\n\ncross-examination.\u201d The trial court cited several specific portions of Mother\u2019s direct and\n\ncross-examination to illustrate its point.\n\n       {\u00b642} The trial court found the credible testimony and the in-camera interview with\n\nK.R.(2) clearly establish that K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. were subjected to extremely\n\ntraumatic events while living with Mother, including missing meals, witnessing domestic\n\nviolence, witnessing drug abuse, suffering sexual abuse, and having their educational\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044         12\n\n\nneeds neglected. However, Mother continues to deny or downplay this trauma, and even\n\ntestified that her children\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d changed, questioning their credibility.\n\n       {\u00b643} The trial court found the credible evidence bolstered the following concerns\n\nof the GAL: that Mother has not been truthful throughout the case; that Mother does not\n\naccept responsibility for the traumatic experiences of her children; and Mother continues\n\nto use excuses. Though Mother testified she is \u201cin a different place completely\u201d than\n\nbefore, the trial court stated the balance of the testimony does not support Mother\u2019s\n\nassertion.\n\n       {\u00b644} The trial court determined the evidence demonstrates Mother and Father\n\nare not adequately able to supervise the children. For example, Fire testified Mother\n\nfailed in her individual goals and she still had concerns about Mother because of her drug\n\nuse and Father because of the domestic violence. Further, Van Buren gave credible\n\ntestimony that Father continues to have issues in discussing his triggers, and the visits\n\nwith Mother and Father were inconsistent, and during one visit, G.B. escaped from the\n\nhome because the door was not locked and she was not being adequately watched. The\n\ntrial court also noted Skrzypiec\u2019s testimony that Mother was dishonest about her\n\nsubstance abuse, and that Mother is frequently overwhelmed.\n\n       {\u00b645} The trial court found neither Mother nor Father are suitable to care for any\n\nof the children at this time, and the motion to extend is not in L.B.\u2019s best interest. Further,\n\nthe credible evidence establishes that R.R. and T.R. are capable and willing to care for\n\nand support all four of the children, and put the best interest of the children ahead of their\n\nown interests.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       13\n\n\n       {\u00b646} The trial court then did an extensive review of the relevant best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a-j), and addressed them as follows: (a) Mother\n\ntestified she wants legal custody of all four children; however, the court questioned the\n\nsincerity of this request; (b) the interview with K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of the GAL\n\nand did not support Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wanted to live with her; (c) the children\n\nare bonded with each other and bonded to R.R. and T.R., while there is no healthy bond\n\nbetween the children and either Mother or Father; (d) the children are doing well in the\n\nhome of Custodians, as this is a safe, loving, and healthy environment; however, neither\n\nMother and Father could meet the emotional, educational, or basic needs of the children\n\nand there is a legitimate concern that the return of any of the children to them would place\n\nthem at risk physically and emotionally; (e) Father is 100% disabled due to a traumatic\n\nbrain injury, is not able to care for any of the children, and has committed acts against\n\nMother in the past; Mother and Father have used drugs; Mother\u2019s presentation in court\n\nwas \u201coff\u201d and she appeared to be suffering from some physical or mental ailment; Mother\n\nstruggles with mental health stability and has trouble telling the truth; (f) Custodians\n\nappear most likely to facilitate visitation; Mother did not follow orders in other cases and\n\nwas not truthful with the GAL; and (g) Mother indicated child support is not current.\n\n       {\u00b647} The trial court concluded, upon review of the testimony presented and\n\nreview of the above-factors, it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to be\n\ngranted legal custody.\n\n       {\u00b648} Further, it would not be in the best interest of G.B. or L.B. for Mother to be\n\nnamed their legal custodian. Finally, it would not be in the best interest of L.B. to grant\n\nthe motion to extend.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044   14\n\n\n       {\u00b649} As to visitation, the trial court found it would be detrimental to allow any\n\nadditional visits with the children for Mother or Father other than as recommended by the\n\nGAL in her report.\n\n       {\u00b650} The trial court named R.R. and T.R. the legal custodians of G.B. and L.B.,\n\nand denied Mother\u2019s motions. The trial court also denied SCDJFS\u2019 motion to extend with\n\nregard to L.B.\n\n       {\u00b651} Mother appeals the March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and assigns the following as error.\n\n       {\u00b652} \u201cI.

Franklin No. 12AP-985, 2013-Ohio-3214. This is because\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      15\n\n\nthe award of legal custody does not divest parents of their residual rights, privileges, and\n\nresponsibilities.

In re L.P., 5th Dist. Muskingum No.\n\nCT2016-0045, 2017-Ohio-52, citing In re Hockstock, 98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208.\n\nThis requirement does not apply, however, in cases involving abuse, neglect, or\n\ndependency. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that, \u201c[a] juvenile court adjudication\n\nof abuse, neglect, or dependency is a determination about the care and condition of a\n\nchild and implicitly involves a determination of the unsuitability of the child\u2019s custodial\n\nand/or noncustodial parents.\u201d In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843\n\nN.E.2d 1188. Thus, \u201c[w]hen a juvenile court adjudicates a child to be abused, neglected,\n\nor dependent, it has no duty to make a separate finding at the dispositional hearing that\n\na noncustodial parent is unsuitable before awarding legal custody to a nonparent.\u201d Id.\n\n       {\u00b658} In this case, both G.B. and L.B. were adjudicated dependent.\n\n       {\u00b659} R.C. 2151.353(A) states, in pertinent part,\n\n       If a child is adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the court\n\n       may make any of the following orders of disposition:\n\n              ***\n\n       (3) Award legal custody of the child to either parent or to any other person\n\n       who, prior to the dispositional hearing, files a motion requesting legal\n\n       custody of the child or is identified as a proposed legal custodian in a\n\n       complaint or motion filed prior to the dispositional hearing by any party to\n\n       the proceedings * * *.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      16\n\n\n       {\u00b660} A trial court \u201cmust have wide latitude in considering all the evidence\u201d and a\n\ncustody decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.

As an appellate court, we neither weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility\n\nof the witnesses. Our role is to determine whether there is relevant, competent, and\n\ncredible evidence upon which the finder of fact could base its judgment. Cross Truck\n\nEquip. Co. v. The Joseph A. Jeffries Co., 5th Dist. Stark No. CA5758, 1982 WL 2911\n\n(Feb. 10, 1982).

C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr., 54 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 279, 376 N.E.2d 578 (1978).\n\n       {\u00b661} Unlike in a permanent custody proceeding where a juvenile court\u2019s standard\n\nof review is by clear and convincing evidence, the standard of review in legal custody\n\nproceedings is a preponderance of the evidence.

Mother argues she completed her case plan services, has\n\nemployment, and is medically compliant. She also contends the trial court\u2019s finding it was\n\nin the best interest of the children for Custodians to be awarded custody was against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence because she was bonded to the children and completed\n\nher case plan. Father similarly argues the trial court\u2019s determination was against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence because Mother completed her case plan, and because\n\nboth Mother and Father made progress in remedying the conditions that led to the\n\nremoval of the children.\n\n       {\u00b664} We disagree with Mother and Father.\n\n       {\u00b665} The statutory scheme regarding an award of legal custody does not include\n\na specific test or set of criteria, and a trial court must base its decision on the best interest\n\nof the child. In re C.R., 108 Ohio St.3d 369, 2006-Ohio-1191, 843 N.E.2d 1188; In re\n\nP.S., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00007, 2012-Ohio-3431. When determining the issue of\n\nlegal custody, the trial court should consider the totality of the circumstances. In re D.T.,\n\n5th Dist. Stark No. 2013CA00252, 2014-Ohio-2495. Trial courts should consider all\n\nfactors relevant to the best interest of the child. Id.

However, the successful completion of a case plan is not dispositive on\n\nthe issue of reunification. In re W.A.J., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99813, 2014-Ohio-604.\n\nWhile it may be in Mother\u2019s best interest to complete the case plan, this is only one factor\n\nfor a trial court to consider what is in the best interest of the child, and, \u201cin legal custody\n\ncases, trial courts should consider all factors relevant to the best interest of the child.\u201d In\n\nthe Matter of D.P. and G.P., 5th Dist. Stark No. 2010CA00348, 2011-Ohio-1907.\n\n       {\u00b667} Where a parent has participated in his or her case plan and completed most\n\nor all of the plan requirements, a trial court may still properly determine that such parent\n\nhas not substantially remedied the problems leading to agency involvement.

In this case, the GAL\n\ntestified that while Mother has substantially completed her case plan, Mother failed to\n\nalleviate the risks present at the time of removal and the same concerns present at the\n\nbeginning of the case still continue today.\n\n       {\u00b668} The issue in this case is whether the preponderance of the evidence\n\ndemonstrated it was in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians. The trial court issued a detailed, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis as to\n\nwhy it determined it was in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians and deny Mother\u2019s motions. Further, though Mother and Father contend they\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044   19\n\n\nsubstantially remedied any problems leading to agency involvement, the testimony and\n\nevidence presented at the hearing do not support this conclusion.\n\n       {\u00b669} We find the determination by the trial court is supported by competent and\n\ncredible evidence.\n\n       {\u00b670} Mother had no contact with G.B. for an extended period of time while she\n\nwas in Florida. Fire has continued concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse because\n\nshe never accepted responsibility, and instead blamed it on her medical conditions and/or\n\nchildhood trauma. Hadden similarly has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s long-term\n\nsobriety, particularly due to the Mother\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior throughout the\n\nproceedings. The GAL also has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s sobriety because\n\nof her recent jumpy and inappropriate appearance.          Van Buren described Mother\u2019s\n\nbehavior as inconsistent throughout the case, and more erratic since July. Van Buren\n\nhas concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse. The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony\n\nabout her remedying of concerns to not be credible and stated Mother\u2019s testimony was\n\ngarbled, lacked direction, and her recollection was not clear.\n\n       {\u00b671} Hadden and the GAL testified to Mother\u2019s dishonesty and inability to take\n\nresponsibility for her actions throughout the proceedings, and stated she had not\n\nremedied these concerns. Skrzypiec confirmed Mother initially lied to her about her\n\nsubstance abuse and lied to the court about her employment.\n\n       {\u00b672} Additionally, multiple witnesses had concerns about the visits G.B. and L.B.\n\nhad with Mother and Father. Hadden stated it was difficult for Mother and Father to\n\nmanage both children. The GAL stated Mother could do short visits with G.B. and L.B.,\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       20\n\n\nbut could not manage them full-time. Van Buren stated the visits were inconsistent, and\n\nshe had concerns about both Mother and Father\u2019s ability to supervise the children.\n\n       {\u00b673} Father is 100% disabled, with a traumatic brain injury. The undisputed and\n\nunrebutted evidence from all witnesses in this case is that he cannot be left alone to\n\nparent the children.\n\n       {\u00b674} Hadden testified it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to\n\nbe granted legal custody. Hadden describes Custodians as loving, cooperative, attentive,\n\nand bonded to the children. Further, both G.B. and L.B. are very bonded to each other,\n\nand to their half-siblings, who also live with Custodians. The GAL testified that while\n\nMother has worked hard, she is unable to appropriately parent. G.B. and L.B. are thriving\n\nin Custodians\u2019 home, and they, along with their half-siblings, are very close. Thus, it is in\n\nthe best interest of both G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to be awarded legal custody, with\n\nMother and Father having short weekly visits.\n\n       {\u00b675} Mother also claims the trial court did not consider the testimony about her\n\ngood visits, her continued counseling, and case plan compliance in its decision. However,\n\nwhile there was testimony about her case plan compliance and several good visits, there\n\nwas also testimony by multiple witnesses that the visits were inconsistent and many\n\nconcerns still remained. As this Court has previously stated, the trial court may believe\n\nall, part, or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it. Rogers v. Hill,\n\n124 Ohio App.3d 468, 706 N.E.2d 438 (4th Dist. 1998). Further, as discussed above,\n\nMother\u2019s compliance with her case plan is only one factor to consider in the best interest\n\ndetermination.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     21\n\n\n                                       Six-Month Extension\n\n       {\u00b676} Mother argues the trial court committed error in denying SCDJFS\u2019 motion\n\nfor six-month extension. We disagree.\n\n       {\u00b677} A trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an extension of temporary custody\n\nis a discretionary one.       See R.C. 2151.415(D)(1) and (2).           Pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.415(D)(1), a trial court can extend temporary custody for six months only if it finds,\n\nby clear and convincing evidence, (1) that such extension is in the best interests of the\n\nchild, (2) that there has been significant progress on the case plan, and (3) that there is\n\nreasonable cause to believe that the child will be reunified with a parent or otherwise\n\npermanently placed within the period of extension.          See In re McNab., 5th Dist.\n\nTuscarawas Nos. 2007 AP 11 0074, 2007 AP 11 0075, 2008-Ohio-1638.\n\n       {\u00b678} While Mother has made significant progress on her case plan, as detailed\n\nabove, the concerns that existed at the beginning of the case still exist. Though the\n\nmotion was made by SCDJFS, Hadden testified she now believes it is in the best interest\n\nof L.B. for the motion to be denied and legal custody be granted to Custodians. This is\n\nbecause Hadden believes that a six-month extension is not enough time for her concerns\n\nabout Mother to be eliminated and there is not reasonable cause to believe L.B. will be\n\nreunified with Mother within six months, particularly due to the lack of rigorous and\n\nintensive substance abuse treatment.\n\n       {\u00b679}   As discussed above, the evidence before the trial court supports the\n\nconclusion that an extension of temporary custody was not in L.B.\u2019s best interest, but,\n\nrather, L.B.\u2019s interests were best served by award of legal custody to Custodians.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044          22\n\n\n                                            Due Process\n\n       {\u00b680} In the title of her second assignment of error, Mother asserts the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision violated her due process rights. However, Mother makes no argument in the\n\nbody of her brief as to how or why her due process rights were violated.\n\n       {\u00b681} \u201cIf an argument exists that can support [an] assignment of error, it is not this\n\ncourt\u2019s duty to root it out.\u201d Thomas v. Harmon, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 08CA17, 2009-\n\nOhio-3299, quoting State v. Carman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90512, 2008-Ohio-4368. \u201cIt\n\nis not the function of this court to construct a foundation for [an appellant\u2019s] claims; failure\n\nto comply with the rules governing practice in the appellate courts is a tactic which is\n\nordinarily fatal.\u201d Catanzarite v. Boswell, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24184, 2009-Ohio-1211.\n\nTherefore, \u201c[w]e may disregard any assignment of error that fails to present any citations\n\nto case law or statutes in support of its assertions.\u201d Frye v. Holzer Clinic, Inc., 4th Dist.\n\nGallia No. 07CA4, 2008-Ohio-2194; See also App.R. 16(A)(7); App.R. 12(A)(2); State v.\n\nNorman, 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 2010-CA-22, 2011-Ohio-596; State v. Untied, 5th Dist.\n\nMuskingum No. CT2006005, 2007-Ohio-1804.\n\n       {\u00b682} As pointed out by SCDJFS, Mother has made no argument to support this\n\nassertion, nor has she supported her allegations with references to the record or citations\n\nto authority to support a finding that the trial court violated her due process rights.\n\nAppellate Rule 16(A)(7) requires an appellant to include in his or her briefs, \u201c* * * [a]n\n\nargument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of\n\nerror presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions * * *.\u201d We may\n\nnot create an argument for Mother as to why her due process rights were violated. See\n\nState v. Carter, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2020-CA-0031, 2021-Ohio-358.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     23\n\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b683} Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not commit error in\n\nawarding legal custody of L.B. and G.B. to Custodians or in denying Mother\u2019s motion to\n\nreturn and terminate with regards to L.B. and G.B. Further, we find the trial court did not\n\ncommit error in denying the motion for six-month extension with regards to L.B.\n\n       {\u00b684} Accordingly, both Mother and Father\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       {\u00b685} The March 15, 2021 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common\n\nPleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.\n\nBy Gwin, P.J.,\n\nWise, John, and\n\nWise, Earle J., concur\n\f\f",

(\u201cMother\u201d) is the Mother of four children. Father M.B. (\u201cM.B.\u201d) is the\n\nFather of G.B., born on August 31, 2015, and L.B., born on February 18, 2019. The father\n\nof Mother\u2019s two older children, K.R.(1) and K.R.(2), is deceased.            R.R. and T.R.\n\n(\u201cCustodians\u201d) are the paternal aunt and uncle of K.R.(1) and K.R.(2).\n\n       {\u00b63}   On May 10, 2018, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and\n\nG.B. were dependent, neglected, and abused children. The complaint alleged as follows:\n\nSCDJFS received multiple referrals regarding the family dating back to October of 2017;\n\nthere were concerns about domestic violence in the home and substance abuse by both\n\nparents; there were reports that K.R.(1) was acting as the primary caretaker for the\n\nyounger children; school officials reported several incidents of concern; K.R.(1) sent a\n\ngroup text indicating she was going to commit suicide; SCDJFS contacted Mobile Youth\n\nCrisis for K.R.(1); SCDJFS observed multiple adults coming out of the home with large\n\nblack trash bags; Mother denied substance abuse concerns, but refused to take a drug\n\ntest; K.R.(2) and G.B. had multiple observable scratches and bruises; Mother was\n\nrecently charged with OVI and possession of a controlled substance; Father was recently\n\nconvicted of domestic violence against Mother; both K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) made multiple\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      3\n\n\nconcerning statements regarding events and inappropriate circumstances that occurred\n\nwhile living with Mother and Father; and K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) repeatedly expressed\n\nconcern of returning to their prior home environment.\n\n       {\u00b64}   The magistrate held a shelter care hearing on May 11, 2018. On the same\n\nday, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. The trial\n\ncourt issued a judgment entry on August 1, 2018, finding K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\ndependent. Further, the court found \u201cMother was not available to care for the children as\n\nshe has absconded law enforcement and there are warrants out for Mother\u2019s arrest.\u201d The\n\ncase then proceeded to disposition. The disposition entry, also filed on August 1, 2018,\n\nplaced K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. in the legal custody of Custodians.\n\n       {\u00b65}   Mother filed a motion for change of custody and/or motion for visitation with\n\nregards to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. on December 28, 2018.\n\n       {\u00b66}   On February 25, 2019, SCDJFS filed a complaint alleging L.B. was a\n\ndependent and neglected child. The complaint alleged, in part, as follows: G.B., K.R.(1),\n\nand K.R.(2) are in the legal custody of relatives; the older children witnessed substance\n\nabuse by the parents and domestic violence between the parents; Mother tested positive\n\nfor various substances during her pregnancy with L.B., including cocaine, marijuana, and\n\nmethamphetamines; Mother stated at the hospital that she was going to live with her\n\ngrandfather, however, the number she provided to SCDJFS was not a working number;\n\nSCDJFS was unable to make contact with Mother again; and both Mother and Father\n\nhave a criminal history. On February 27, 2019, L.B. was placed in the temporary custody\n\nof SCDJFS.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       4\n\n\n       {\u00b67}   On March 20, 2019, Custodians filed a motion for legal custody of L.B. Both\n\nMother and Father stipulated to a finding of dependency as to L.B.; SCDJFS deleted the\n\nallegations of neglect. The trial court issued a judgment entry on May 28, 2019, finding\n\nL.B. was a dependent child. L.B. was placed in the temporary custody of SCDJFS and\n\nSCDJFS placed her with Custodians.\n\n       {\u00b68}   SCDJFS filed a motion to extend temporary custody as to L.B. on both\n\nDecember 10, 2019 and July 21, 2020. Mother filed a motion to return L.B. to her and\n\nterminate the case with respect to L.B. on August 13, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b69}   The trial court conducted a trial on Mother and Custodians\u2019 motions on\n\nSeptember 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020. The trial court also held an in-camera\n\ninterview of K.R.(2), as requested by Mother, on November 12, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b610} Mother testified she lost her children in 2018 when her oldest daughter\n\nthreatened suicide.    Mother admitted she was addicted to methamphetamines from\n\nNovember of 2017 to March of 2018. She also admitted that, at the beginning of the case,\n\nshe misrepresented her substance abuse issues to SCDJFS. In 2017, Father pushed\n\nher and yelled at a lot. Both she and Father were abusing drugs. Father has a brain\n\ninjury and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from being the military. After Mother\n\nlost the children, she went to Florida to be with her mother. She used cocaine in July of\n\n2018. When her brother overdosed in Ohio, she returned for several months, but then\n\nreturned to Florida. Mother returned to Ohio to stay in February of 2019.\n\n       {\u00b611} Mother began counseling in 2018 and remains in counseling today for\n\ngrief/trauma issues and drug abuse. Mother completed drug screens several times per\n\nweek and stated she was negative every time. Mother described her Vyvanse and\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      5\n\n\nAdderall medications, and stated she informed SCDJFS when those prescriptions\n\nchanged.\n\n       {\u00b612} Mother stated she has complied with her case plan. Mother testified she is\n\ncurrently working, taking care of a hospice patient. Mother completed the Goodwill\n\nparenting program and is going through the home-based visitation program. She believes\n\nshe has done everything SCDJFS has asked of her to make the home appropriate.\n\n       {\u00b613} Mother also attends counseling with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2). Mother knows\n\nthat K.R.(1) is angry at her; however, Mother believes this anger is misplaced. Mother\n\nstated she is now clean and sober, and has made significant changes in her life since she\n\nlost custody of the children. She believes it is in the best interest of the children to be\n\nreturned to her care.\n\n       {\u00b614} On cross-examination, Mother confirmed there was a no-contact order\n\nbetween her and Father when she got pregnant with L.B.\n\n       {\u00b615} Jennifer Fire (\u201cFire\u201d) is the supervisor of the Goodwill parenting program.\n\nFire testified that Mother successfully completed the Goodwill parenting program;\n\nhowever, Mother failed on the individual goals portion of the program. Mother\u2019s home\n\nwas appropriate and, when Fire visited, Mother was utilizing the safety plan put in place\n\nby SCDJFS. Fire had concerns regarding Mother\u2019s substance abuse issues because,\n\nthroughout the program, Mother vacillated from accepting responsibility of that to\n\nminimizing it; Fire stated Mother never accepted full responsibility for her substance\n\nabuse problems, and blamed it on her ADHD and childhood trauma. Fire testified that\n\nMother minimized the impact that her substance abuse and domestic violence had on her\n\nchildren.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        6\n\n\n       {\u00b616} Rosemary Diamond (\u201cDiamond\u201d) supervised Mother\u2019s visits on September\n\n15 and February 29th between Mother and G.B. She felt the visits went well and Mother\n\nwas appropriate with G.B.\n\n       {\u00b617} K.M. is Father\u2019s mother. She supervised a visit between G.B., L.B., and\n\nMother and Father. She testified that Mother and Father were able to manage the\n\nchildren and G.B. did not want to leave. K.M. has not had any problem with access to\n\neither G.B. or L.B. while they have been in Custodians\u2019 care.\n\n       {\u00b618} Nicole Hadden (\u201cHadden\u201d) is the ongoing caseworker for L.B. For both\n\nMother and Father, their case plans required they complete parenting assessments,\n\ncomplete assessments at CommQuest, and follow any recommendations.                    Father\n\ncomplied with the recommendations from his parenting evaluation, as he had to continue\n\ncounseling and medication services through the VA; comply with the orders of his\n\nprobation from his domestic violence conviction; and complete substance abuse\n\ntreatment. Father was recommended for supervised visitation because of the ongoing\n\nconcerns with his memory and mood dysregulation, and his questionable judgment\n\nrelated to a traumatic brain injury.\n\n       {\u00b619} Mother was required to comply with Summit Psychology for her medication\n\nand counseling, complete parenting classes, and attend joint counseling with Father.\n\nMother initially was set up for the color code for approximately six months to monitor her\n\nfor illegal substances. Mother completed the parenting class, is in counseling each week,\n\nand completed the color code drug screens when asked.\n\n       {\u00b620} While Mother testified that she notified Hadden as soon as the doctor\n\nincreased her medication, Hadden stated that Mother advised her on June 9th by email\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        7\n\n\nthat she had a change in medication only after the aide had drug tested her that day. This\n\nconcerned Hadden with regards to Mother\u2019s long-term sobriety.\n\n       {\u00b621} When the home-based visits started, L.B. visited alone. However, when\n\nG.B. was added to the visits, Hadden testified that the clutter and things in the home that\n\nthey previously worked on getting rid of started to come back and it was difficult for Mother\n\nand Father to manage both children. Hadden knew the visits were difficult because of\n\nher interactions with Mother and because Hadden supervised some of the visits herself.\n\nFor example, Mother\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic during the visits when both\n\nG.B. and L.B. were there.\n\n       {\u00b622} The GAL contacted Hadden after the review hearing in July of 2020,\n\nexpressing concern about Mother\u2019s appearance and behavior in court. Hadden wrote a\n\nletter to Mother\u2019s doctor about her concerns with Mother\u2019s medication. Based upon\n\nHadden\u2019s review of her notes and the records she received after Mother signed a release\n\nof information, it appeared that Mother was asking her doctor for Adderall. Mother\u2019s\n\ndoctor provided a letter to Hadden stating she is compliant with medication and he did not\n\nsee a concern prescribing Adderall.\n\n       {\u00b623} While Hadden believes the primary goal is reunification, she has concerns\n\nthat need to be addressed. Her concern for Mother\u2019s sobriety still remains, as does her\n\nconcern about Mother\u2019s dishonesty. With regards to a six-month extension in custody,\n\nwhich would be the last one permissible, Hadden is concerned that would not be enough\n\ntime for her concerns about Mother to be eliminated, particularly due to the lack of\n\nrigorous and intensive substance abuse treatment. Hadden testified that Mother has a\n\nhistory of being dishonest with her throughout the proceedings.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044      8\n\n\n       {\u00b624} Hadden believes it is in the best interest for Custodians to be granted legal\n\ncustody of L.B. Hadden has seen L.B. in their home. The home is busy, but Custodians\n\nare very attentive to the children and are meeting all of their needs. Custodians have\n\nbeen very cooperative with visitation for Mother and Father. L.B. is very bonded and\n\nattached to K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.\n\n       {\u00b625} Kristin Guardado is the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for all four children.\n\n       {\u00b626} Older siblings K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) described to the GAL a life of chaos and\n\nanxiety, including watching Mother and Father do drugs and Father physically abuse\n\nMother. K.R.(1) felt it was her responsibility to care for G.B. When Guardado first met\n\nG.B., G.B. would constantly scream. Guardado felt this happened because it was the\n\nonly way G.B. could get someone to take care of her. Guardado believes it would be\n\ndetrimental to G.B. to be returned to Mother and Father.\n\n       {\u00b627} As to L.B., Guardado recommends custody to Custodians, with short weekly\n\nvisits with Mother and Father. Her concerns about L.B. and G.B. being returned to Mother\n\nand Father include Mother continuing to lie and Mother\u2019s recent jumpy and inappropriate\n\nappearance.    Guardado testified Mother has worked hard; however, she unable to\n\nappropriately parent. For example, Mother suggested she would take L.B. to work with\n\nher all day instead of finding daycare or a babysitter. As to Father, he is unable to\n\nindependently parent.     Further, Mother and Father have \u201clied so many times and\n\nmisrepresented things it is hard to believe anything they say.\u201d Both of Mother\u2019s older\n\nchildren are afraid of Father due to his history of domestic violence against Mother. While\n\nGuardado thinks Mother can supervise L.B. for a short period of time, she cannot parent\n\nher full-time. Father cannot independently parent due to his PTSD and brain injury.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        9\n\n\n       {\u00b628} During the Goodwill parenting program, Mother and Father had visits with\n\nG.B. and L.B.     However, those were suspended in July of 2020 based upon the\n\nrecommendation of Guardado and because of the concerns expressed by the individuals\n\nsupervising the Goodwill parenting program.\n\n       {\u00b629} Guardado believes Custodians will continue to facilitate a relationship\n\nbetween Mother and the children. She believes it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B.\n\nfor Custodians to have legal custody, with Mother and Father having short weekly visits.\n\n       {\u00b630} On cross-examination, Guardado confirmed Mother has completed portions\n\nof her case plan. However, Guardado stated the children still have issues, and some of\n\nthe concerns present with Mother and Father at the beginning of the case still continue\n\non.\n\n       {\u00b631} The trial court also admitted Guardado\u2019s August 2020 report into evidence.\n\nShe believes it is in the best interest of the children for: (1) Custodians to maintain legal\n\ncustody of K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B.; (2) Custodians to be granted legal custody of L.B.;\n\n(3) Mother\u2019s motions to terminate and return to be denied; (4) Mother to continue to\n\nparticipate in therapeutic visits with K.R.(1) and K.R.(2); (5) K.R.(1) and K.R.(2) to not be\n\naround Father until their counselor feels it is appropriate; (6) Mother and Father to have\n\nweekly 2-hour visits with L.B. and G.B.; and (7) Father not to be left unsupervised with\n\nthe children.\n\n       {\u00b632} Guardado reports that the children are thriving in their current home. They\n\nare all very close.\n\n       {\u00b633} Guardado included many details in her report, but concluded that she has\n\nconcerns about returning any of the children to Mother. This is due to Mother and Father\u2019s\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044     10\n\n\ndishonesty throughout the case and their inability to take responsibility for their actions\n\nand instead blame others. Guardado stated the parties failed to alleviate the risks that\n\nwere present at the time of the removal.\n\n       {\u00b634} Amanda Van Buren (\u201cVan Buren\u201d) is a family coach at Goodwill parenting\u2019s\n\nhome-based parenting program. She works with Mother and Father weekly. One of the\n\ngoals in the program to promote safety was for Mother and Father to move their bedroom\n\nup by L.B. Van Buren stated this was not Mother\u2019s idea, despite Mother\u2019s testimony that\n\nit was. Mother recently has been acknowledging her past triggers; however, Father has\n\nnot.\n\n       {\u00b635} Van Buren stated the visits are inconsistent. While some visits go smoothly,\n\nsometimes the parents would rather discuss their own issues instead of spending time\n\nwith the children. Initially, Van Buren and the parents addressed some safety concerns\n\nin the home. Van Buren recently had to address these same issues in the home in July.\n\nVan Burden also stated there are times where Mother and Father failed to adequately\n\nsupervise the children. Van Buren testified Mother\u2019s behavior is inconsistent, and has\n\nbecome more erratic since July. Her main concerns regarding the safety of the children\n\nare: consistent demeanor, ability to supervise the children, and substance abuse.\n\n       {\u00b636} Jessica Skrzypiec (\u201cSkrzypiec\u201d) is a licensed clinician who did an\n\nassessment on Mother and continues to be her counselor.               Her diagnoses were\n\nadjustment disorder, ADHD, and major depressive disorder. Mother was not truthful\n\nduring her initial assessment about her substance abuse. However, during treatment in\n\nMarch of 2019, Mother admitted abusing her prescription Adderall. Skrzypiec stated\n\nMother\u2019s treatment has progressed well and she is not currently worried about Mother\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044        11\n\n\nabusing medication because Mother has done well and has done everything Skrzypiec\n\nhas asked her to do.\n\n       {\u00b637} On cross-examination, Skrzypiec confirmed that on August 28, 2020,\n\nMother was very upset because she lost her job. However, Mother testified on September\n\n1, 2020 that she was still employed; thus, Mother lied to the court.\n\n       {\u00b638} R.R. is the current custodian of the children and has been since February\n\nof 2018. R.R. will follow any orders of the court with regards to this case. R.R. believes\n\nit is in the best interest of the children for R.R. and her husband to have legal custody of\n\nthe children, but also believes that Mother should have a relationship with G.B. and L.B.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court issued an extensive judgment entry on March 15, 2021.\n\n       {\u00b640} The trial court found the GAL\u2019s testimony credible and noted it took her\n\nreport into consideration in its decision. Additionally, the trial court stated it agreed with\n\nthe concerns reported by the GAL.\n\n       {\u00b641} The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony questionable. As the first day of\n\ntrial progressed, \u201cMother\u2019s testimony became more garbled and lacking in a clear\n\ndirection. It was as if Mother placed some marbles or cotton in her mouth during the\n\nbreak session. Her recollection of events, especially as to time, degraded throughout\n\ncross-examination.\u201d The trial court cited several specific portions of Mother\u2019s direct and\n\ncross-examination to illustrate its point.\n\n       {\u00b642} The trial court found the credible testimony and the in-camera interview with\n\nK.R.(2) clearly establish that K.R.(1), K.R.(2), and G.B. were subjected to extremely\n\ntraumatic events while living with Mother, including missing meals, witnessing domestic\n\nviolence, witnessing drug abuse, suffering sexual abuse, and having their educational\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044         12\n\n\nneeds neglected. However, Mother continues to deny or downplay this trauma, and even\n\ntestified that her children\u2019s \u201cstories\u201d changed, questioning their credibility.\n\n       {\u00b643} The trial court found the credible evidence bolstered the following concerns\n\nof the GAL: that Mother has not been truthful throughout the case; that Mother does not\n\naccept responsibility for the traumatic experiences of her children; and Mother continues\n\nto use excuses. Though Mother testified she is \u201cin a different place completely\u201d than\n\nbefore, the trial court stated the balance of the testimony does not support Mother\u2019s\n\nassertion.\n\n       {\u00b644} The trial court determined the evidence demonstrates Mother and Father\n\nare not adequately able to supervise the children. For example, Fire testified Mother\n\nfailed in her individual goals and she still had concerns about Mother because of her drug\n\nuse and Father because of the domestic violence. Further, Van Buren gave credible\n\ntestimony that Father continues to have issues in discussing his triggers, and the visits\n\nwith Mother and Father were inconsistent, and during one visit, G.B. escaped from the\n\nhome because the door was not locked and she was not being adequately watched. The\n\ntrial court also noted Skrzypiec\u2019s testimony that Mother was dishonest about her\n\nsubstance abuse, and that Mother is frequently overwhelmed.\n\n       {\u00b645} The trial court found neither Mother nor Father are suitable to care for any\n\nof the children at this time, and the motion to extend is not in L.B.\u2019s best interest. Further,\n\nthe credible evidence establishes that R.R. and T.R. are capable and willing to care for\n\nand support all four of the children, and put the best interest of the children ahead of their\n\nown interests.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       13\n\n\n       {\u00b646} The trial court then did an extensive review of the relevant best interest\n\nfactors contained in R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(a-j), and addressed them as follows: (a) Mother\n\ntestified she wants legal custody of all four children; however, the court questioned the\n\nsincerity of this request; (b) the interview with K.R.(2) confirmed the concerns of the GAL\n\nand did not support Mother\u2019s testimony that K.R.(2) wanted to live with her; (c) the children\n\nare bonded with each other and bonded to R.R. and T.R., while there is no healthy bond\n\nbetween the children and either Mother or Father; (d) the children are doing well in the\n\nhome of Custodians, as this is a safe, loving, and healthy environment; however, neither\n\nMother and Father could meet the emotional, educational, or basic needs of the children\n\nand there is a legitimate concern that the return of any of the children to them would place\n\nthem at risk physically and emotionally; (e) Father is 100% disabled due to a traumatic\n\nbrain injury, is not able to care for any of the children, and has committed acts against\n\nMother in the past; Mother and Father have used drugs; Mother\u2019s presentation in court\n\nwas \u201coff\u201d and she appeared to be suffering from some physical or mental ailment; Mother\n\nstruggles with mental health stability and has trouble telling the truth; (f) Custodians\n\nappear most likely to facilitate visitation; Mother did not follow orders in other cases and\n\nwas not truthful with the GAL; and (g) Mother indicated child support is not current.\n\n       {\u00b647} The trial court concluded, upon review of the testimony presented and\n\nreview of the above-factors, it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to be\n\ngranted legal custody.\n\n       {\u00b648} Further, it would not be in the best interest of G.B. or L.B. for Mother to be\n\nnamed their legal custodian. Finally, it would not be in the best interest of L.B. to grant\n\nthe motion to extend.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044   14\n\n\n       {\u00b649} As to visitation, the trial court found it would be detrimental to allow any\n\nadditional visits with the children for Mother or Father other than as recommended by the\n\nGAL in her report.\n\n       {\u00b650} The trial court named R.R. and T.R. the legal custodians of G.B. and L.B.,\n\nand denied Mother\u2019s motions.

The trial court issued a detailed, thorough, and well-reasoned analysis as to\n\nwhy it determined it was in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. to grant legal custody to\n\nCustodians and deny Mother\u2019s motions.

Fire has continued concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse because\n\nshe never accepted responsibility, and instead blamed it on her medical conditions and/or\n\nchildhood trauma. Hadden similarly has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s long-term\n\nsobriety, particularly due to the Mother\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior throughout the\n\nproceedings. The GAL also has concerns that remain about Mother\u2019s sobriety because\n\nof her recent jumpy and inappropriate appearance.          Van Buren described Mother\u2019s\n\nbehavior as inconsistent throughout the case, and more erratic since July. Van Buren\n\nhas concerns about Mother\u2019s substance abuse. The trial court found Mother\u2019s testimony\n\nabout her remedying of concerns to not be credible and stated Mother\u2019s testimony was\n\ngarbled, lacked direction, and her recollection was not clear.\n\n       {\u00b671} Hadden and the GAL testified to Mother\u2019s dishonesty and inability to take\n\nresponsibility for her actions throughout the proceedings, and stated she had not\n\nremedied these concerns.

Hadden stated it was difficult for Mother and Father to\n\nmanage both children. The GAL stated Mother could do short visits with G.B. and L.B.,\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044       20\n\n\nbut could not manage them full-time. Van Buren stated the visits were inconsistent, and\n\nshe had concerns about both Mother and Father\u2019s ability to supervise the children.\n\n       {\u00b673} Father is 100% disabled, with a traumatic brain injury. The undisputed and\n\nunrebutted evidence from all witnesses in this case is that he cannot be left alone to\n\nparent the children.\n\n       {\u00b674} Hadden testified it is in the best interest of G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to\n\nbe granted legal custody. Hadden describes Custodians as loving, cooperative, attentive,\n\nand bonded to the children. Further, both G.B. and L.B. are very bonded to each other,\n\nand to their half-siblings, who also live with Custodians. The GAL testified that while\n\nMother has worked hard, she is unable to appropriately parent. G.B. and L.B. are thriving\n\nin Custodians\u2019 home, and they, along with their half-siblings, are very close. Thus, it is in\n\nthe best interest of both G.B. and L.B. for Custodians to be awarded legal custody, with\n\nMother and Father having short weekly visits.\n\n       {\u00b675} Mother also claims the trial court did not consider the testimony about her\n\ngood visits, her continued counseling, and case plan compliance in its decision. However,\n\nwhile there was testimony about her case plan compliance and several good visits, there\n\nwas also testimony by multiple witnesses that the visits were inconsistent and many\n\nconcerns still remained.

This is\n\nbecause Hadden believes that a six-month extension is not enough time for her concerns\n\nabout Mother to be eliminated and there is not reasonable cause to believe L.B. will be\n\nreunified with Mother within six months, particularly due to the lack of rigorous and\n\nintensive substance abuse treatment.\n\n       {\u00b679}   As discussed above, the evidence before the trial court supports the\n\nconclusion that an extension of temporary custody was not in L.B.\u2019s best interest, but,\n\nrather, L.B.\u2019s interests were best served by award of legal custody to Custodians.\n\fStark County, Case Nos. 2021 CA 00039, 2021 CA 00040, 2021 CA 00043 & 2021 CA 00044          22\n\n\n                                            Due Process\n\n       {\u00b680} In the title of her second assignment of error, Mother asserts the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision violated her due process rights.

Lawson, murdered four\npeople: Stacey Holston, her eight-year-old son D.H., her mother, Tammie McGuire,\nand her mother\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire. On October 13, Lawson surrendered\nto police and confessed to the murders.\n        {\u00b6 3} The Lawrence County grand jury returned an 11-count indictment,\nincluding four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications.\nLawson entered guilty pleas to all counts and specifications of the indictment.\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.06, a three-judge panel of the common pleas court heard the\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nstate\u2019s evidence of guilt with regard to the capital charges. The panel found Lawson\nguilty of four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications as to\neach count. The panel then conducted a sentencing hearing and sentenced Lawson\nto death for each aggravated murder.\n       {\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Lawson raises five propositions of law. We overrule\neach of the propositions of law. After conducting an independent review, we\nconclude that although significant mitigating factors exist, the aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\nof the four aggravated murders. We further conclude that each death sentence is\nappropriate and proportionate. Therefore, we affirm all four death sentences.\n                 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                     A. Facts\n       {\u00b6 5} Arron Lawson was Stacey Holston\u2019s first cousin. Stacey lived with\nher husband, Todd Holston, and their sons, D.H. and two-year-old B.H., near Pedro,\nOhio. Lawson lived nearby and was in the habit of visiting the Holstons daily.\n       {\u00b6 6} Lawson was infatuated with Stacey; he told his mother that she was\n\u201cthe love of his life.\u201d In his confession, he stated that he and Stacey had been\nhaving a sexual affair, which Stacey had broken off \u201c[a]bout a week ago,\u201d i.e.,\napproximately October 6, 2017.\n       {\u00b6 7} Lawson visited Stacey on Tuesday, October 10, 2017, the day before\nthe murders, while Todd was at work. During this visit, Lawson surreptitiously\nentered a bedroom at the back of the house, opened a window, and inserted a book\nbetween the window and the sill to hold the window partly open. By his own later\nadmission, he did this with the intention of entering the house the next day to\ncommit murder.\n       {\u00b6 8} At about 7:15 p.m., when Todd came home, Lawson was still there\nwith Stacey and the children. At Stacey\u2019s request, Todd drove Lawson home. Todd\ntestified at trial that Lawson \u201cwasn\u2019t too happy about\u201d being sent home.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The next morning, Todd left for work at approximately 4:30 a.m.\nAbout half an hour later, Lawson entered the Holstons\u2019 residence through the rear\nwindow. He had a 20-gauge shotgun, eight shells loaded with slugs, and a backpack\ncontaining flashlights, toilet paper, knives, a tarp, and other items. Lawson hid in\nthe back bedroom until about 8:30 a.m.\n       {\u00b6 10} Meanwhile, D.H.\u2019s school bus arrived and D.H. left the house to go\nto school. Stacey sent with him a note directing the school to put D.H. on a different\nbus that afternoon than he normally rode and to take him to his grandparents\u2019 house.\n       {\u00b6 11} By 8:30, after D.H. had left, Stacey was in the home with B.H.\nStacey entered the back bedroom where Lawson was hiding, and Lawson shot her\nthree times in the chest and shoulder. She fell to the floor.\n       {\u00b6 12} Lawson dragged her body to D.H.\u2019s bedroom where he lifted her\nonto a futon bed and, using a condom, had sex with her corpse. Lawson discarded\nthe condom in the kitchen wastebasket. He then returned to the bedroom and\ncovered Stacey\u2019s body with a blanket and the futon\u2019s mattress.\n       {\u00b6 13} As these events were occurring, Todd was at a worksite in Maysville,\nKentucky, where he clocked in at 6:43 a.m. It was Stacey\u2019s habit to send Todd a\ntext message early every morning to make sure he had arrived safely at work. When\nshe failed to do so on October 11, Todd began to worry. He repeatedly tried to call\nand text her throughout the day, but she did not respond.\n       {\u00b6 14} At 9:23 a.m., Lawson used Stacey\u2019s cell phone to call D.H.\u2019s school.\nPosing as Todd, Lawson told the school\u2019s guidance secretary that D.H.\u2019s\ngrandfather was unable to watch D.H. that day, so D.H. should be taken home on\nhis usual bus that afternoon. Lawson spoke calmly and gave the guidance secretary\nno reason to doubt he was who he claimed to be. Because Lawson was using\nStacey\u2019s phone, the phone number on the school\u2019s caller ID matched the number\non file in the office. So the original arrangement was canceled and D.H. was\nbrought home after school. Meanwhile, Lawson waited at the Holstons\u2019 residence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nHe fed B.H., changed his diaper, and later put him down for a nap in the main\nbedroom.\n        {\u00b6 15} When D.H. arrived home, Lawson sat with him in the living room\nand they talked about school. However, D.H. began asking Lawson where his\nmother was and when his father was coming home. Lacking answers, Lawson told\nD.H. that Lawson\u2019s PlayStation 3 was in D.H.\u2019s room behind the dresser. D.H.\nwent to his bedroom. As D.H. looked behind his dresser, Lawson shot him twice,\nonce in the arm and once in the torso. Lawson left the boy\u2019s body where it fell and\ncovered it with clothes. After killing D.H., Lawson continued to wait in the\nHolstons\u2019 residence.\n        {\u00b6 16} Around 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., Todd tried again to contact Stacey on his\nway home from his worksite. He then called Stacey\u2019s mother, Tammie McGuire,\nwho lived about a quarter mile from the Holstons. Tammie agreed to check on\nStacey and drove to the house. A few minutes later, she called Todd back and told\nhim that she was at his house but that the door was locked. Todd authorized her to\nbreak in, and she did. The phone connection remained open. A few minutes later,\nTodd heard Tammie scream, \u201cOh, my God\u201d followed by a loud noise. Then, as\nTodd later testified, \u201call of a sudden it was just quiet.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 17} By Lawson\u2019s account, he was in the main bedroom when he heard\nTammie forcing her way into the house. He hid behind the bedroom door; when\nTammie opened that door, he stepped out and shot her. Lawson dragged Tammie\u2019s\nbody to the laundry area and threw a blanket over her. He then used her keys to\nmove her truck behind the house.\n        {\u00b6 18} Meanwhile, Todd phoned Tammie\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire, and\napprised him of the situation. Donald said he would go and check, and he walked\nto the house.\n        {\u00b6 19} According to Lawson, Donald initially tried to enter through the\nback door, but it was locked, so Donald went around to the locked front door and\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u201crammed through.\u201d When Donald came in, Lawson shot him and dragged the body\nto D.H.\u2019s bedroom.\n        {\u00b6 20} About 10 to 20 minutes later, Todd arrived home. When he came\nthrough the front door, Lawson attacked him with a knife, stabbing him a number\nof times in the head, neck, and torso. Todd wrested the knife from Lawson and\npinned him to the couch.\n        {\u00b6 21} Todd asked Lawson why he had attacked him.            According to\nLawson, he then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a blind thing of anger.\u201d But\nTodd testified that Lawson had said, \u201cThere\u2019s been people breaking in out here, and\nI thought you was one of them.\u201d According to Todd, Lawson then \u201cshook like he\nsnapped out of something.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 22} Todd also asked Lawson where Stacey and the children were.\nLawson said they were in the bedroom and were \u201cokay.\u201d Todd testified that he\nthen forcefully removed Lawson from the house. Lawson drove away in the truck\nbelonging to the McGuires.\n        {\u00b6 23} Todd checked on B.H., who was unharmed. (According to Lawson,\nB.H. slept through at least the first three murders.) Todd then looked through the\nhouse. After finding the bodies of Tammie, Stacey, and Donald, he took B.H. and\ndrove to the McGuires\u2019 house, where he borrowed a cell phone from Tammie\u2019s\nbrother and called 9-1-1.\n        {\u00b6 24} Lawson had planned to hide out in the woods, but he had left his\nbackpack and shotgun behind in the Holstons\u2019 house, so he drove to a store. With\ncash stolen from the Holstons, he bought new clothes to replace his bloodstained\nones.\n        {\u00b6 25} While driving the truck, Lawson was pursued by police; he\nabandoned the truck and fled on foot. Eventually, he reached a wooded area, where\nhe spent the next two nights. Lawson later said that after one \u201ccold, cold night\u201d in\nthe woods, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have no more flight in me.\u201d Nevertheless, he did not\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemerge from the woods until the morning of October 13, when he was apprehended.\nDetectives took him to the county prosecutor\u2019s office in Ironton, where he\nconfessed to the four murders.\n       {\u00b6 26} Dr. Robert Shott, the deputy Montgomery County coroner,\nperformed autopsies on all four victims. He testified that Stacey suffered two\nshotgun wounds to the chest and one to the back, fatally injuring her heart and\nlungs. D.H. was shot twice, receiving fatal wounds to the heart, lung, and aorta.\nTammie was shot once in the neck, fatally injuring her spinal cord, and once in the\nshoulder. Donald was shot once in the shoulder and once, fatally, in the chest.\n                              B. Procedural History\n       {\u00b6 27} On October 18, 2017, the grand jury indicted Lawson on four counts\nof aggravated murder with death specifications. Count 1 charged the aggravated\nmurder of Stacey Holston with prior calculation and design, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A).      Count 1 carried three death specifications: course of conduct\ninvolving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(5); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7),\npredicated on rape.\n       {\u00b6 28} Count 2 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of D.H., a child\nunder the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(C). This count carried six death\nspecifications: course of conduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder of a\nvictim younger than 13, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9); murder to escape\ndetection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated\non kidnapping; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Count 3 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Tammie\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Count 4 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Donald\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Counts 3 and 4 both carried four death specifications: a course of\nconduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n       {\u00b6 30} The indictment also included the following noncapital counts: Count\n5, attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.02(A); Count 6,\nfelonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Count 7, aggravated burglary,\nin violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2); Count 8, rape, in violation of R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2); Count 9, abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B); Count\n10, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Count 11, tampering with\nevidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1); Count 12, theft of a motor vehicle, in\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(5); and Count 13, failure to comply with\na police officer\u2019s order, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii). Counts\n1 through 4 and Counts 7, 8, and 10 carried firearm specifications.\n       {\u00b6 31} On February 21, 2019, the state voluntarily dismissed the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8) specifications that were attached to Counts 2, 3, and 4. Lawson then\nentered pleas of guilty to all remaining counts and specifications before the three-\njudge panel. Over the next few days, the three-judge panel heard witness testimony\nas required by R.C. 2945.06 and on February 25, 2019, unanimously found Lawson\nguilty of all counts of the indictment except Count 8 (rape) and of all specifications\nexcept the specification for felony murder predicated on rape that was attached to\nCount 1 (aggravated murder of Stacey).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The panel then held a mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C.\n2929.03(D)(1) beginning on February 26, 2019. After hearing the evidence that\nLawson offered in mitigation, the panel sentenced him to death on all four counts\nof aggravated murder. He also received sentences totaling 59 years and six months\non the noncapital counts and specifications. Lawson appeals of right and we now\naddress his propositions of law.\n      II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY\n                                     HEARING\n       {\u00b6 33} Lawson initially pleaded not guilty to the indictment. More than a\nyear later, he changed his mind, waived a jury trial, and entered guilty pleas to each\ncount of the indictment and to all the death specifications (except the three that the\nstate voluntarily dismissed). In so doing, he acted against his trial counsel\u2019s advice.\n       {\u00b6 34} Defense counsel never requested a hearing into Lawson\u2019s\ncompetence to stand trial. Nevertheless, in his first proposition of law, Lawson\ncontends that the trial court had a constitutional duty to inquire into his competence\nto stand trial before accepting his change of plea.\n                                 A. Relevant Facts\n       {\u00b6 35} On February 11, 2019, several days into the jury-selection process,\ndefense counsel informed the trial court that Lawson did not want a trial. In\nchambers, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys explained that Lawson did not want to put\nhimself, his family, and the families of the victims through a full trial \u201cwith all of\nthe gruesome photos that would be presented [and] all of the things that would be\n* * * said about him.\u201d Counsel said that he had explained to Lawson that if he\nentered a guilty plea, the case would proceed before a three-judge panel, not a jury.\n       {\u00b6 36} Defense counsel then observed:\n\n\n       I suppose * * * if he wants to do that, there\u2019s always a question of\n       whether or not there needs to be an examination of his competence\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        to waive jury in a capital case. Obviously that\u2019s not something that\n        we can [determine] today. And it may be something that would\n        require a psychological evaluation, although in a capital case, I\n        would ask for an independent one rather than what we would do in\n        a typical case.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 37} One of the prosecutors noted that the defense team included a\npsychologist, Dr. Bob Stinson, and asked whether Dr. Stinson could render an\nopinion on Lawson\u2019s competence. Defense counsel replied that he could not\n\u201ccommit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that,\u201d because a competency assessment is\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d from a mitigation assessment.        Nevertheless, defense\ncounsel noted that Dr. Stinson \u201c[o]bviously * * * would have more familiarity with\n[Lawson] than anyone else\u201d and stated that he \u201cassume[d] that it could be done in\na manner\u201d; he also stated that he had not \u201cthought through whether that would\ncreate some sort of a conflict in terms of what [Dr. Stinson\u2019s] testimony would be\nin the mitigation phase.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 38} The trial judge then stated that he had \u201cbrought this up months ago\non the potential for a competency evaluation\u201d but that he had declined to order one\nbecause the defense had opposed it. (Any previous discussions of competency\nissues must have occurred off the record, as the transcript does not reflect any\ndiscussion of a competency evaluation before February 11.) The trial judge\ncontinued, \u201cI\u2019m now second-guessing myself that I should have [ordered] it over\nobjection.\u201d       Defense counsel remarked that the court was \u201cnot incorrect\u201d in\ndeclining to order an evaluation over the defense\u2019s opposition. The prosecutor\npointed out that the defense had not raised a question about Lawson\u2019s competence\nto stand trial.\n        {\u00b6 39} At the request of defense counsel, the court took a recess so that\nLawson could discuss the matter with his family. When the session resumed,\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefense counsel told the court at a bench conference that \u201cafter much thought,\nconsideration, [and] discussion with family members and counsel,\u201d Lawson had\ndecided not to change his plea and would proceed with a jury trial. The court then\nresumed the jury-selection process and the prospective jurors were brought into the\ncourtroom.\n       {\u00b6 40} The next day, however, Lawson\u2019s counsel informed the trial court\nthat Lawson had decided to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea\nto a three-judge panel. The trial court questioned Lawson at length about whether\nhe understood that he was waiving his constitutional right to have a jury hear and\ndecide the case. Lawson affirmatively stated a number of times that he understood\nthe consequences of his decision.\n       {\u00b6 41} During this exchange, the trial court asked Lawson whether he had\nconsulted with his family about his decision.          Lawson answered that after\nconsulting with his family the previous day, he \u201chad a second thought throughout\nthe night.\u201d He informed the trial court that \u201cit was a little rough because I saw my\nmom crying and it always plays on my heart. And then after a while I have to make\na better decision for my life and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 42} The trial court accepted Lawson\u2019s waiver. Lawson\u2019s counsel then\nfiled a written waiver of jury trial that Lawson had signed. Defense counsel\ncertified in writing that they had consulted with Lawson, had explained his right to\na jury trial, and believed that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\nThe trial court\u2019s acceptance of Lawson\u2019s jury waiver was also filed; it included the\ntrial court\u2019s finding that the waiver was made \u201cknowingly, intelligently and\nvoluntarily.\u201d On February 19, 2019, the chief justice of this court assigned two\nadditional judges to serve on the three-judge panel.\n       {\u00b6 43} On February 21, 2019, the panel held a change-of-plea hearing. At\nthe hearing, defense counsel stated that they had discussed the change of plea with\nLawson for about 90 minutes that day. Prior to proceeding to consider the change\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nof plea, the presiding judge asked counsel whether at any point they ever had any\nconcerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency * * * that\nwould have prevented him from knowingly and intelligently and voluntarily\nentering into th[e] plea waiver\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that based on\nhis many years of experience with representing incompetent clients, his interactions\nwith Lawson gave him \u201cno reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of\nthose categories.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 44} The presiding judge then asked whether defense counsel had\n\u201cconducted appropriate investigation * * * into * * * mental issues or competency\nissues.\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that with Dr. Stinson\u2019s assistance, they\nhad conducted such an investigation. After lengthy discussions with Dr. Stinson,\nthe attorney said, the defense had elected not to raise the issue of \u201cpossible\nincompetency to proceed in this matter.\u201d\n            B. The Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire Into Competence\n  1. Historical perspective on the prohibition against the trial of incompetent\n                                     defendants\n       {\u00b6 45} The fundamental principle that a criminal defendant who has been\nadjudicated to be legally incompetent shall not be required to stand trial has deep\nroots in common law. See Freeman v. People, 4 Denio 9, 1847 WL 4116, *19\n(N.Y.1847) (recognizing that new competency legislation \u201cwas not introductory\u201d\nas it was \u201cin strict conformity with the common law on the subject\u201d). The\nprohibition against the trial of incompetent defendants \u201cdates back at least to the\ntime of [Sir William] Blackstone.\u201d Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct.\n2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), fn. 11. In the eighteenth century, Blackstone wrote\nthat if a man commits an offense and becomes \u201cmad\u201d after the commission of the\noffense, then he should not be arraigned for it \u201cbecause he is not able to plead to it\nwith that advice and caution that he ought.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\non the Laws of England, 24. Similarly, if he becomes \u201cmad\u201d after pleading, he\nshould not be tried, \u201cfor how can he make his defense?\u201d Id.\n       {\u00b6 46} The Supreme Court has long held that convicting a defendant while\nhe is legally incompetent violates the United States Constitution. \u201c[T]he conviction\nof an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process, and * * *\nstate procedures must be adequate to protect this right.\u201d Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S.\n375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), citing Bishop v. United States, 350\nU.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835 (1956).\n       {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2945.37, which was first enacted in 1978, see Am.Sub.H.B. No.\n565, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2937, 2943-2946, sets forth the process that a\ndefendant is due when an issue is raised pertaining to his competency. R.C.\n2945.37(B) states:\n\n\n               In a criminal action * * *, the court, prosecutor, or defense\n       may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. If\n       the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\n       hold a hearing on the issue * * *. If the issue is raised after the trial\n       has commenced, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for\n       good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion.\n\n\n               2. What Triggers a Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire?\n       {\u00b6 48} A defendant is rebuttably presumed to be competent to stand trial.\nState v. Barton, 108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 56, citing\nR.C. 2945.37(G). \u201c[A] competency determination is necessary only when a court\nhas reason to doubt the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 401, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, fn. 13.\n       {\u00b6 49} Over 60 years ago, the now well-known test for determining legal\ncompetency to stand trial was announced in Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402,\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960).           Agreeing with the solicitor general\u2019s\nargument, the Supreme Court explained that a trial court must inquire into whether\nthe defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a\nreasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well\nas factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Id. at 402. This standard\nalso applies when a court is determining a defendant\u2019s competency to plead guilty\nor waive his right to counsel. Godinez at 396, 398-399.\n       {\u00b6 50} We first recognized the Dusky competency test in State v. Chapin,\n67 Ohio St.2d 437, 439-440, 424 N.E.2d 317 (1981), and have continued to apply\nit in the ensuing decades, see State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-\n5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 56 (stating that the Dusky test applies when assessing a\ndefendant\u2019s competency to enter a guilty plea).\n       {\u00b6 51} Due process requires a court to hold a hearing when it has been\npresented with a \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence.\u201d Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S.\n162, 175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). When the issue of competency is\nraised after a defendant\u2019s trial has commenced, R.C. 2945.37(B) directs that \u201cthe\ncourt shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s\nown motion.\u201d We have construed the connotation of the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d to be\n\u201cin accordance with the general principles set forth [by the Supreme Court] in\nDrope and Pate[,383 U.S. at 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815].\u201d State v. Berry,\n72 Ohio St.3d 354, 360, 650 N.E.2d 433 (1995), citing Chapin. Therefore, \u201c[t]he\nright to a hearing on the issue of competency rises to the level of a constitutional\nguarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence\u2019 such that\nan inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s\nright to a fair trial.\u201d Berry at 359, quoting Drope at 175.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                     3. Analysis\n      a. Were there sufficient indicia of incompetence to require a hearing?\n       {\u00b6 52} Lawson acknowledges that his counsel never asked for a\ncompetency evaluation, but he contends that the trial court denied him due process\nby not ordering one sua sponte. He contends that the record in this case establishes\nsufficient \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d to require a hearing.\n       {\u00b6 53} Three facts, Lawson contends, called his competence into question.\nFirst, his decision to waive a jury trial and plead guilty to the indictment was made\nagainst the advice of his counsel. Second, he displayed \u201cindecision,\u201d in that he\nchanged his mind about pleading guilty. Third, at the time of his plea, he \u201cwas\nbeing treated with psychiatric medications,\u201d a fact he disclosed to the trial court\nduring the plea colloquy.\n       {\u00b6 54} Lawson\u2019s acting against the advice of counsel does not indicate\nincompetence. We have noted that a defendant\u2019s \u201crefusal to heed his counsel\u2019s\nadvice * * * [does] not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the\ncharges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in\nhis defense.\u201d State v. Johnson, 112 Ohio St.3d 210, 858 N.E.2d 1144, 2006-Ohio-\n6404, \u00b6 161. Indeed, such a refusal generally \u201cevidences [the defendant\u2019s] ability\nto participate in his defense.\u201d State v. Fletcher 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 49814, 1985\nWL 4215, *2 (Dec. 5, 1985).\n       {\u00b6 55} Nor does Lawson\u2019s alleged indecision suggest that he was\nincompetent. The record shows that after first expressing his desire to plead guilty\non February 11, 2019, Lawson discussed the matter with his counsel and family\nand then decided not to change his plea. The next day, however, he filed his written\njury waiver. The record does not show that he changed his mind again. On\nFebruary 21, he still wished to plead guilty, and he did so without further hesitation.\n       {\u00b6 56} It is not surprising that a defendant contemplating entering a guilty\nplea in a capital case would display some hesitation. \u201cIndecisiveness is not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsame as incompetency[,] however.\u201d Johnson v. State, 138 Md.App. 539, 567, 772\nA.2d 1260 (2001). And Lawson\u2019s indecision does not amount to irrationality. See\nUnited States v. Miller, 531 F.3d 340, 348 (6th Cir.2008) (in determining\ncompetency, a court is to consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior).\nLawson explained that he changed his mind due to the emotional toll he felt when,\nduring a visit, his mom cried to him about his actions. However, once he distanced\nhimself from those emotions and further reflected, he knew that the best decision\nfor him was to change his not-guilty plea to a plea of guilty.\n       {\u00b6 57} In any event, Lawson\u2019s change of mind was brief. Having decided\nto plead guilty on February 12, he held to his decision in the face of his counsel\u2019s\ncontrary advice and after a rigorous plea colloquy. And he continued to hold to his\ndecision over the ensuing nine days and during the change-of-plea hearing before\nthe three-judge panel. This sequence of events has no tendency to show that\nLawson lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding, nor does it suggest that he was unable to understand the\nproceedings.\n       {\u00b6 58} Finally, Lawson cites his statement during the plea colloquy that he\nwas taking prescription medication. The presiding judge asked Lawson whether he\nwas \u201cpresently under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or mind-altering\nsubstance.\u201d Lawson replied: \u201cI\u2019m under prescription medication, but that is all.\u201d\nHe stated that he was taking naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and Zoloft.\n       {\u00b6 59} However, \u201cit is a matter of statutory and decisional law that \u2018[t]he\nfact that a defendant is taking antidepressant medication or prescribed psychotropic\ndrugs does not negate his competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio\nSt.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 56, quoting State v. Ketterer, 111\nOhio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 71; see also State v. Mink, 101\nOhio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 38; R.C. 2945.37(F) (\u201cThe\ncourt shall not find a defendant incompetent to stand trial solely * * * because the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant is receiving or has received psychotropic drugs or other medication, even\nif the defendant might become incompetent to stand trial without the drugs or\nmedication\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 60} In both Mink and Ketterer, as Lawson points out, \u201ccompetency\nevaluations were conducted * * * before each defendant entered his guilty plea to\ncapital charges.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 54, citing Mink at \u00b6 31-32 and Ketterer at \u00b6 67.\nNevertheless, Mink and Ketterer do not stand for the proposition \u201cthat a court must\norder a competency hearing before accepting a guilty plea from a capital defendant\nwho is taking a prescription medication for mental illness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)\nMontgomery at \u00b6 54. And in Montgomery, we expressly declined to so hold. Id.\n       {\u00b6 61} Lawson stated during the colloquy that his medications did not\nprevent him from understanding what his attorneys or the court said to him, nor did\nthey affect his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court\nalso asked Lawson if there was any medication that he had been prescribed but was\nnot taking; he said no. Moreover, during the plea colloquy, Lawson \u201cappropriately\nanswered the court\u2019s questions,\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 57, and displayed no\n\u201coutrageous, irrational or confused\u201d behavior, id. at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 62} The presiding judge asked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen\nany indication that Lawson\u2019s medications \u201ccould be affecting his ability to reason\nor [his] judgment.\u201d Both attorneys replied in the negative. \u201cSolemn declarations\nin open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S.\n63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Lawson\u2019s counsel knew that Lawson\nwas taking medication, \u201cyet they had no concerns about his competence.\u201d\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 51. The\nrecord contains no countervailing evidence\u2014nothing to suggest that the\nmedications Lawson was taking could have hampered his ability to understand the\nproceedings or assist his counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 63} Finally, after Lawson informed the court that he was taking\nprescription medication, the trial court conducted a full plea colloquy under\nCrim.R. 11. The panel asked Lawson whether he understood the constitutional\nrights he was waiving by pleading guilty, the consequences of his pleading guilty,\nand the maximum sentence he could potentially receive if found guilty of the capital\nspecifications. The panel had previously verified that he understood the written\nplea of guilty and had executed it with the assistance of his counsel. The panel\nasked Lawson whether he understood each of the charges against him. Lawson\n\u201canswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent\nfashion.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 50.\n       {\u00b6 64} Trial counsel\u2019s statements to the trial court are also important in\nconsidering whether the trial court violated Lawson\u2019s due-process rights by failing\nto initiate a competency hearing. \u201cTrial counsel\u2019s assurances to the court are\nrelevant because \u2018a defendant\u2019s counsel is in the best position to evaluate a client\u2019s\ncomprehension of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Stanley v. Cullen, 633 F.3d 852, 861 (9th\nCir.2011), quoting Hernandez v. Ylst, 930 F.2d 714, 718 (9th Cir.1991). The\nSupreme Court has recognized that \u201cjudges must depend to some extent on counsel\nto bring issues into focus.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 176-77, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103. Lawson\u2019s defense counsel never asserted their belief that Lawson was\nincompetent. In fact, lead defense counsel stated just the opposite.         Counsel\nindicated that the trial court was correct in declining to order a competency\nevaluation. He told the court that he had spent \u201cmany hours\u201d with Lawson over a\n17-month period and had discussed Lawson\u2019s competence with Dr. Stinson, and\nlead defense counsel expressly stated that he had \u201cno reason to think\u201d that Lawson\nwas incompetent to enter a guilty plea. \u201c[W]hen a trial court must decide whether\nto hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, reviewing courts\n\u2018give weight * * * to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the defendant.\u2019 \u201d State\nv. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298 (1999), quoting Commonwealth\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nv. Hall, 15 Mass.App. 1, 3, 443 N.E.2d 121 (1982). In this case, the presiding judge\nhad observed Lawson\u2019s in-court demeanor for months and was able to observe his\ndemeanor during the plea colloquy. Indeed, \u201cit is noteworthy that nobody on the\nspot thought [Lawson\u2019s] behavior raised any question as to his competence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Cowans at 84; accord State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-\nOhio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 63; Montgomery at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 65} Under all the circumstances here, the facts that Lawson cites as\nindicia of incompetence were insufficient to overcome the general presumption of\ncompetence and were insufficient to entitle him to a competency evaluation.\n               b. Did the trial court raise the issue of competency?\n       {\u00b6 66} Lawson contends that \u201cthe [trial] court itself effectively raised the\nissue\u201d of his competence\u2014presumably on February 11, 2019, when the court\nwondered out loud whether it should have ordered a competency hearing earlier in\nthe case over the defense\u2019s objections. Lawson relies on State v. Bock, 28 Ohio\nSt.3d 108, 110, 502 N.E.2d 1016 (1986), in which this court stated: \u201c[T]here is no\nquestion that where the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is raised\nprior to the trial, a competency hearing is mandatory.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.37(B).\nLawson\u2019s argument is not clear, but he seems to imply that a competency hearing\nwas required under Bock because the trial court itself had \u201craised\u201d the issue of\ncompetence.\n       {\u00b6 67} We disagree. While a trial court may raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency, see R.C. 2945.37(B), the trial court in this case was not exercising this\nauthority. In essence, the trial court was asking the defense whether it wanted a\ncompetency hearing. Asking the defense whether it wants a hearing does not by\nitself make a hearing mandatory. The fact that the trial court did not order a\ncompetency evaluation and hearing, when it had the authority to sua sponte do so,\nshows that the court did not intend to raise the issue of Lawson\u2019s competence.\nMoreover, even if a competency hearing were mandatory under Bock, the failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nhold one would be harmless error in this case: \u201c[I]t is clear that the failure to hold\na mandatory competency hearing is harmless error where the record fails to reveal\nsufficient indicia of incompetency.\u201d Bock at 110.\n                    4. No support for the dissent\u2019s per se rule\n        {\u00b6 68} As set forth above, the Supreme Court has established, and Ohio has\nadopted, specific procedures to adequately protect an incompetent defendant from\nbeing tried or convicted. The dissent, however, advocates for the adoption of a per\nse rule\u2014that a competency examination and hearing are required at the instant in\nwhich a capital defendant pursues an adverse-interest request, such as entering a\nplea of guilty.\n        {\u00b6 69} There is no compelling reason to adopt that per se rule. As the Fifth\nCircuit has held:\n\n\n        [W]e decline to adopt a per se rule that, as a matter of law, a trial\n        court must doubt a capital punishment defendant\u2019s competency, or\n        conclude that such defendant does not understand the proceedings\n        against him or appreciate their significance, or conclude that he\n        cannot rationally aid his attorney in his defense simply because it is\n        obvious to the court that the defendant is causing his trial to be\n        conducted in a manner most likely to result in a conviction and the\n        imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\nRoberts v. Dretke, 381 F.3d 491, 498 (5th Cir.2004).\n        {\u00b6 70} A per se rule is also incongruous with the Supreme Court\u2019s position\nthat there is no one sign that triggers the need for a competency evaluation.\n\n\n        [E]vidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at\n        trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but\n       that even one of these factors standing alone may, in some\n       circumstances, be sufficient. There are, of course, no fixed or\n       immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further\n       inquiry to determine fitness to proceed; the question is often a\n       difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle\n       nuances are implicated.        That they are difficult to evaluate is\n       suggested by the varying opinions trained psychiatrists can entertain\n       on the same facts.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) Drope, 420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103.\n       {\u00b6 71} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Lawson\u2019s first proposition of\nlaw.\n III. VALIDITY OF LAWSON\u2019S JURY WAIVER AND GUILTY PLEAS\n       {\u00b6 72} In his second proposition of law, Lawson contends that both his jury\nwaiver and his subsequent guilty pleas were invalid because they were not knowing,\nvoluntary, and intelligent. This proposition essentially restates the claims made in\nhis first proposition of law; the same three circumstances that the first proposition\ncalls \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d are here relied upon as reasons to question the\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent character of his jury waiver and guilty pleas.\nLawson also argues that before accepting his waiver and pleas, the trial court should\nhave advised him that a single juror could prevent a death sentence. For the reasons\nthat follow, we reject both claims.\n                               A. The Jury Waiver\n       {\u00b6 73} \u201cIn addition to determining that a defendant who seeks to plead\nguilty * * * is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself that the waiver of his\nconstitutional rights is knowing and voluntary.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 400, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321. The United States Supreme Court has explained the\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\ndistinction between a competency determination and an inquiry into the knowing\nand voluntary character of a rights waiver as follows:\n\n\n               The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant\u2019s mental\n       capacity; the question is whether he has the ability to understand the\n       proceedings. * * * The purpose of the \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d\n       inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actually\n       does understand the significance and consequences of a particular\n       decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 401, fn. 12, quoting Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 28, 113\nS.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).\n       {\u00b6 74} A jury waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. E.g.,\nState v. Ruppert, 54 Ohio St.2d 263, 271, 375 N.E.2d 1250 (1978). Waiver may\nnot be presumed from a silent record; however, if the record shows that a jury\nwaiver occurred, the verdict will not be set aside except on a plain showing that the\nwaiver was not freely and intelligently made. Adams v. United States ex rel.\nMcCann, 317 U.S. 269, 281, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). Moreover, a\nwritten waiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. United States\nv. Sammons, 918 F.2d 592, 597 (6th Cir.1990). See generally State v. Bays, 87\nOhio St.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126 (1999).\n       {\u00b6 75} In this case, Lawson executed and filed a written jury waiver.\nAttached to the waiver was the following certification by defense counsel:\n\n\n               We, the undersigned, as counsel for defendant Arron\n       Lawson, have consulted with our client, explained his Constitutional\n       rights to a trial by jury, and made inquiry to determine if his decision\n       * * * was based upon any promises or coercive tactics * * * and\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        explained to him the process of trial by three-judge panel. We find\n        no evidence of any promises or coercive tactics * * *. We recognize\n        that his waiver of jury trial is voluntary. And we believe his waiver\n        is knowingly and intelligently made.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 76} By itself, the fact that a defendant is taking prescription medications\n\u201cdoes not defeat the presumption that his written waiver was knowing, intelligent,\nand voluntary.\u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d\n180, at \u00b6 30. Lawson points to nothing to show \u201cthat he, in fact, failed to understand\nthe waiver proceedings or the effect of his decision to waive\u2014or that his decision\nwas somehow involuntary\u2014because of the prescription medications.\u201d Id.\n                                B. The Guilty Pleas\n        {\u00b6 77} \u201cPrior to accepting a guilty plea from a criminal defendant, the trial\ncourt must inform the defendant that he is waiving his privilege against compulsory\nself-incrimination, his right to jury trial, his right to confront his accusers, and his\nright of compulsory process of witnesses.\u201d State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473,\n423 N.E.2d 115 (1981), paragraph one of the syllabus, following Boykin v.\nAlabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242-243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); see also\nCrim.R. 11(C)(2)(c).\n        {\u00b6 78} In this case, the trial court complied with Ballard and Crim.R.\n11(C)(2)(c) by informing Lawson that his guilty plea waived his rights to confront\nthe state\u2019s witnesses, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to require the state\nto prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial in which he would have had the\nright not to testify against himself.\n        {\u00b6 79} Lawson initiated the decision to plead guilty, \u201cinsisted upon it\nagainst advice of counsel, and held to it through a lengthy plea colloquy,\u201d State v.\nFitzpatrick, 102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 40. In\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nFitzpatrick, this court concluded on similar facts that it was \u201cclear\u201d that a capital\ndefendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was voluntary. Id.\n        {\u00b6 80} Nevertheless, Lawson contends that his plea was not voluntary,\nknowing, and intelligent, because (1) the trial court did not inquire into why he was\nnot following counsel\u2019s advice, (2) the trial court did not inquire more deeply into\nthe nature and effects of the medications Lawson was taking, and (3) the trial court\naccepted the waiver and pleas without a hearing on Lawson\u2019s competence.\n        {\u00b6 81} Lawson argues that when a defendant chooses, contrary to his\ncounsel\u2019s advice, to waive a jury trial or plead guilty, the trial court has a duty to\ninquire into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s decision. But he cites no authority for\nthat position.\n        {\u00b6 82} The decisions whether to waive a jury trial and whether to plead\nguilty belong to the defendant, not counsel. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745,\n751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). A defendant\u2019s election to exercise his\nright to reject his counsel\u2019s advice does not imply that his decision could not have\nbeen knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. To draw such an inference would negate\nthe defendant\u2019s right to decide these matters for himself.\n        {\u00b6 83} Lawson also asserts that his decision to reject counsel\u2019s advice was\n\u201cessentially\u201d equivalent to waiving the right to counsel altogether. We reject this\nassertion; there is an obvious difference between Lawson\u2019s situation\u2014having the\nassistance of counsel, but rejecting counsel\u2019s advice\u2014and having no counsel at all.\n        {\u00b6 84} Lawson also argues that the trial court failed to conduct a sufficient\ninquiry into the prescription drugs he was taking. He contends that the trial court\nshould have asked what the medications were for, who prescribed them, how long\nLawson had been taking them, when he had taken them last, and what effects they\nmay have had on his mental state.\n        {\u00b6 85} Lawson cites Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, at \u00b6 66, in which this court stated: \u201cAdditional inquiry is necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ninto a defendant\u2019s mental state once a defendant seeking to enter a guilty plea has\nstated that he is under the influence of drugs or medication.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 86} However, in Montgomery, we rejected a similar claim on similar\nfacts. The defendant in Montgomery argued that the three-judge panel inadequately\ninquired \u201cinto the effect, if any, that his prescription medications had on his mental\nstate.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 44.\n        {\u00b6 87} When the presiding judge in Montgomery learned at the jury-waiver\nhearing that the defendant was taking prescription medications for mental illness,\nthe judge asked \u201cwhether he had been prescribed the medications and whether he\nwas taking them pursuant to the prescription.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49. The judge also \u201cdirectly\nasked him whether he understood the constitutional rights he was forgoing by\nwaiving his right to a jury, whether he was doing so voluntarily, and whether his\ncounsel had reviewed the jury waiver with him prior to the hearing.\u201d Id. The panel\nlater conducted a plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and \u201cMontgomery\nanswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion.\u201d\nId. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 88} Moreover, \u201c[t]he panel had no reason to believe that Montgomery\nhad any issues with competence or could not intelligently and voluntarily enter a\nguilty plea.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47. Neither the defendant nor counsel in Montgomery \u201cever\nmade any representation to the court that he had any * * * issues with competency.\u201d\nId. The panel specifically asked at the plea hearing\n\n\n        whether [defense counsel] had any reason to believe that\n        [Montgomery] was not competent or capable of voluntarily and\n        intelligently pleading guilty. Defense counsel * * * were aware that\n        Montgomery was medicated for depression, yet they * * * never\n        raised an issue to the court about Montgomery\u2019s ability to\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        understand the proceedings and enter a knowing and voluntary\n        guilty plea.\n\n\nId. at \u00b6 51.\n        {\u00b6 89} In the end, \u201cthere [was] no evidence * * * that Montgomery was not\nin full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point during the\npendency of his case.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180,\nat \u00b6 52. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cthe panel\u2019s inquiry into Montgomery\u2019s\nmental state and use of prescription medications and in its acceptance of\nMontgomery\u2019s guilty plea was adequate and that Montgomery voluntarily and\nknowingly pleaded guilty to capital murder.\u201d Id.\n        {\u00b6 90} The facts of this case closely parallel those of Montgomery. During\nthe plea colloquy, the trial court asked Lawson whether his medications prevented\nhim from understanding what his attorneys or the court told him and whether they\naffected his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court also\nasked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen any indication that Lawson\u2019s\nmedications were affecting his reasoning ability or judgment. Neither Lawson nor\nhis counsel indicated at any point \u201cthat he had any * * * issues with competency,\u201d\nMontgomery at \u00b6 47. Moreover, as in Montgomery, the panel in this case conducted\na plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and Lawson \u201canswered each of the\npanel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion,\u201d id. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 91} \u201cIn short, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that [Lawson]\nwas not in full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point\nduring the pendency of his case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52. \u201c[C]onsidering the totality of the\nevidence,\u201d id., the panel\u2019s inquiry into Lawson\u2019s mental state and use of\nprescription medications was sufficient to comply with Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350,\n2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n      C. Failure to Advise that Single Juror Can Block Death Sentence\n        {\u00b6 92} Lawson contends that his jury waiver and guilty pleas were not\nvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent because the trial court did not tell him that a\nsingle juror can block a death sentence. However, we have rejected that contention.\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 30, citing\nBays, 87 Ohio St.3d at 19-21, 716 N.E.2d 1126; see also Fitzpatrick, 102 Ohio\nSt.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 NE.2d 927, at \u00b6 42-48; Sowell v. Bradshaw, 372\nF.3d 821, 833 (6th Cir.2004). We reject it again today.\n              III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        {\u00b6 93} In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance. To establish ineffective assistance, Lawson must\nshow (1) deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective\nstandard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been\ndifferent. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052,\n80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989),\nparagraphs two and three of the syllabus.\n                A. Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation\n        {\u00b6 94} Lawson argues that his counsel should have requested a competency\nevaluation, which would have led to a competency hearing.\n        {\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.37(B) entitles the defense to a pretrial competency\nhearing upon request: \u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas, * * * the\ncourt, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to\nstand trial. If the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\nhold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense\ncounsel is not ineffective in failing to request that the trial court order a competency\nevaluation or hold a competency hearing when the defendant does not display\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. State v.\nThomas, 97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 96} Lawson contends that counsel\u2019s decision not to request a\ncompetency evaluation cannot be justified as a strategic decision, because\nrequesting an evaluation would have had no possible \u201cdownside.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 97} Lawson\u2019s assertion that there is no downside to requesting a\ncompetency evaluation in this type of situation is questionable: defense counsel\nmay risk straining their relationship with their client when they question his mental\ncompetence and seek to negate his decisions. But in any event, competent counsel\nwould not request an evaluation unless they had some reason to doubt the\ndefendant\u2019s competence. Here, nothing in the record shows that Lawson\u2019s counsel\nhad any such reason.\n       {\u00b6 98} Lawson contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate the\ncompetency issue before declining to request a competency evaluation. He argues\nthat an expert opinion on Lawson\u2019s competence was essential, because counsel\u2019s\n\u201carmchair opinions\u201d were not a sufficient basis on which to make such a decision.\nHe further argues that the record fails to show that defense counsel ever sought an\nexpert opinion.\n       {\u00b6 99} Lawson points to defense counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court on\nFebruary 11, 2019, the day Lawson first announced that he wanted to waive a jury\nand plead guilty. One of the prosecutors asked whether Dr. Stinson could render\nan opinion on competence based on conversations Dr. Stinson and Lawson had\nalready had. One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied:\n\n\n               I can\u2019t commit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that. I know\n       psychologists that I have worked with in the past would probably\n       say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a completely different review and assessment,\u201d\n       and they\u2019re looking for different things than the context of\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       presenting possible psychological information for purposes of\n       mitigation.\n               Obviously [Dr. Stinson] would have more familiarity with\n       this young man than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be\n       done in a manner, although I * * * haven\u2019t thought through whether\n       that would create some sort of a conflict in terms of what his\n       testimony would be in the mitigation phase.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Lawson reads this statement as indicating \u201cthe limited scope of Dr.\nStinson\u2019s services[,] which did not include a competency examination.\u201d But\ndefense counsel did not say that Dr. Stinson could not render such an assessment.\nHe said only that he could not guarantee that Dr. Stinson would be able to form an\nopinion of Lawson\u2019s competence based on the interviewing Dr. Stinson had done\nup to that point. Indeed, counsel went on to say that Dr. Stinson \u201cwould have more\nfamiliarity with [Lawson] than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be done\nin a manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n       {\u00b6 101} Lawson goes on to assert that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that\nindicates that Dr. Stinson or any other mental health professional did, or was even\nasked to do, a competency evaluation on\u201d Lawson. Lawson\u2019s argument misplaces\nthe burden of persuasion: a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal must show from the record that the elements of the claim\nexist. Therefore, Lawson must show that his counsel failed to perform an adequate\ninvestigation of his possible incompetence. See, e.g., State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d\n448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 244.\n       {\u00b6 102} Lawson also ignores what defense counsel said during the plea\nhearing on February 21. During that hearing, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys expressly\nstated that counsel had conducted an investigation into competency issues and that\nthey had consulted Dr. Stinson:\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n               JUDGE BALLARD: * * * [A]t any point did you ever have\n       any concerns that might be raised by Adkins [sic, Atkins v. Virginia,\n       536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002)], or any\n       mental defect or mental deficiency that could have been identified\n       in Mr. Lawson that would have prevented him from knowingly and\n       intelligently and voluntarily entering into this plea waiver?\n               MR. MCVAY [defense counsel]: Not being a psychologist\n       or a psychiatrist * * * I\u2019m not in a position * * * to technically\n       answer that. But based on my many years of experience and 24\n       years as a practicing attorney handling a substantial number of death\n       penalty cases * * * and having had clients who would be Adkins-\n       qualified or otherwise incompetent to enter a plea, * * * I have no\n       reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of those\n       categories at this point in time based upon my discussions with him\n       and many hours spent with him, over 17 months, as well as the time\n       spent with him today.\n\n\n(Capitalization sic.)\n       {\u00b6 103} The presiding judge then asked counsel: \u201c[I]s it safe for this panel\nto assume that you conducted appropriate investigation from your practice into any\nissue that would be addressed by Adkins or mental issues or competency issues?\u201d\nCounsel replied:\n\n\n               We did, your Honor. In keeping with the American Bar\n       Association Guidelines for the Representation of Defendants\n       Charged with Capital Crimes and their recommendation, if not\n       insistence, that we engage a forensic psychologist to work with and\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       examine the defendant in the course of our representation, * * * that\n       in fact has been done. * * *\n               Having said that, and having discussed matters with * * *\n       Dr. Stinson at length, I think I can fairly represent that by virtue of\n       the fact that we have not filed any pleadings pertaining to a possible\n       incompetency to proceed in this matter * * *, I feel that we\u2019re on\n       safe ground in that respect in the sense that we have done our due\n       diligence with regard to that * * *. We have looked into all of those\n       matters, discussed most, * * * I would suggest all of those matters\n       with Mr. Lawson. I believe that we\u2019re on solid ground to move\n       forward with what his intentions are at this point in time.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) This statement indicates that Dr. Stinson examined Lawson and\nthat defense counsel consulted Dr. Stinson in determining whether to further pursue\nthe issue of Lawson\u2019s competence. Lawson cites nothing in the record that either\ncontradicts counsel\u2019s representations or shows that the investigation that had been\nconducted was deficient.\n       {\u00b6 104} Finally, Lawson is unable to show prejudice resulting from\ncounsel\u2019s declining to request a competency evaluation. It is true that if Lawson\u2019s\ncounsel had requested an evaluation, the trial court would have been required by\nstatute to order one.   But that says nothing about the likely outcome of the\nevaluation and of the hearing. To show prejudice, Lawson must show that there is\na reasonable probability that an evaluation \u201cwould have revealed that he was\nincompetent to stand trial,\u201d Alexander v. Dugger, 841 F.2d 371, 375 (11th\nCir.1988).\n       {\u00b6 105} As we concluded in relation to Lawson\u2019s first proposition of law,\nthe record simply contains insufficient indicia of incompetence to require a\ncompetency evaluation or a competency hearing. If defense counsel had requested\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\na competency evaluation, the trial court would have had to hold a hearing. But the\nalleged indicia of incompetence that Lawson repeatedly cites would have been\ninsufficient to overcome the legal presumption of competence, because they do not\nsuggest that Lawson was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the\nproceedings against him or of assisting in his own defense. The record of the\npenalty phase contains numerous references to Lawson\u2019s mental-health history,\nincluding diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, and posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). However, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere\nmental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be\nemotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the\ncharges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 110, 502\nN.E.2d 1016. Accordingly, the record does not show a reasonable likelihood that\nthe trial court would have found Lawson incompetent to stand trial.\n              B. Failure to Argue Mercy As a Mitigating Factor\n       {\u00b6 106} In another part of his third proposition of law, Lawson contends\nthat his counsel were ineffective because they failed to renew a pretrial motion to\ninstruct the jury on mercy as a mitigating factor and because they did not argue\nduring the penalty phase that mercy was a mitigating factor.\n       {\u00b6 107} As the state points out, any issues concerning jury instructions\nbecame moot once Lawson waived a jury trial. However, Lawson also contends\nthat counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue before the three-\njudge panel that mercy is a mitigating factor. That facet of his claim is obviously\nnot rendered moot by Lawson\u2019s jury waiver.\n       {\u00b6 108} However, the claim lacks merit, as we have repeatedly held that\nmercy is not a mitigating factor. See, e.g., State v. Belton, 149 Ohio St.3d 165,\n2016-Ohio-1581, 74 N.E.3d 319, \u00b6 88; State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-\nOhio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955, \u00b6 253. Hence, counsel did not perform deficiently by\ndeclining to argue otherwise.     \u201cDefense counsel is not required to advance\n\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\narguments lacking merit. * * * It is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to\nmaneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested or rejected legal\ntheories.\u201d State v. McNeill, 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 449, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998).\n       {\u00b6 109} Lawson also fails to show prejudice. Defense counsel in this case\npresented extensive mitigating evidence focused on Lawson\u2019s dysfunctional family\nand upbringing, his alleged abuse, traumatic events in his life, and his diagnosed\nmental disorders. Their penalty-phase arguments to the panel concentrated on that\nevidence. Lawson does not explain how adding an express plea for mercy would\nhave been reasonably likely to make a difference in the penalty-phase outcome.\n       {\u00b6 110} We overrule Lawson\u2019s third proposition of law.\n                          V. SENTENCING OPINION\n       {\u00b6 111} In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the\npanel\u2019s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends\nthat the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against\nhim and improperly discounted the mitigating factors. We disagree.\n                 A. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s 12-page sentencing opinion begins with a\nstatement of facts. According to Lawson, the opinion includes several facts that\n\u201cmade the crime particularly disturbing\u201d and could only \u201cbe termed as\ninflammatory.\u201d Lawson contends that by mentioning these facts in the opinion, the\npanel \u201cemployed\u201d them as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\n       {\u00b6 113} The \u201cinflammatory\u201d facts Lawson refers to include the following:\nthat Lawson had sexual intercourse with Stacey\u2019s body after shooting her, that\nStacey had recently ended a sexual relationship with Lawson, that Lawson posed\nas D.H.\u2019s father to deceive D.H.\u2019s school into sending him home that day, that\nLawson \u201ctricked\u201d D.H. into entering the bedroom and shot him twice at close range,\nthat Lawson prepared in advance for the murders by propping a window open the\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nnight before, that he moved and covered the bodies, and that he was arrested two\ndays later \u201c[a]fter a manhunt.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 114} But a trial court does not \u201ccreate nonstatutory aggravating\ncircumstances\u201d merely by \u201cdiscussing the facts of the crime.\u201d State v. Robb, 88\nOhio St.3d 59, 82, 723 N.E.2d 1019 (2000). Moreover, the sentencing opinion here\ncorrectly identified the aggravating circumstances of which Lawson was found\nguilty as to each aggravated-murder count. When a trial court has correctly\nidentified the statutory aggravating circumstances pleaded and proved at trial, we\npresume that the trial court understood the difference between statutory aggravating\ncircumstances and the facts that describe the nature and circumstances of the\noffense. State v. Martin, 151 Ohio St.3d 470, 2017-Ohio-7556, 90 N.E.3d 857,\n\u00b6 137.\n         {\u00b6 115} Lawson points to nothing in the opinion that suggests that the panel\nused the facts as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Instead, he contends that\nthe opinion fails to affirmatively state that the facts were not so used, and he argues\nthat this failure suffices to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only\nthe aggravating circumstances to which Lawson pleaded guilty. However, the\nopinion does specifically state that the panel did not consider Lawson\u2019s alleged\naffair with Stacey or the other \u201coffenses charged in the indictment,\u201d which would\ninclude his abuse of Stacey\u2019s corpse, as aggravating circumstances.\n         {\u00b6 116} Lawson\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our precedent.             The\nopinion \u201cidentified only the applicable statutory aggravating circumstances * * *\nand listed no improper nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.              Therefore,\n[Lawson] has not rebutted the presumption that the court relied only upon the\naggravating circumstances it identified.\u201d State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio St.3d 175,\n2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, \u00b6 121.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n            B. Unconsidered or Improperly Discounted Mitigation\n        {\u00b6 117} Lawson also contends that the panel\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201ccontains\nweighing errors\u201d that violate the Eighth Amendment as construed in Lockett v.\nOhio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion),\nand Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The\nUnited States Supreme Court in Eddings held that the sentencer in a capital case\nmay not \u201crefuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 114. Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider\nsome mitigating factors and gave too little weight to others.\n        {\u00b6 118} Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider Dr. Stinson\u2019s\ntestimony bearing on the mitigating factor of Lawson\u2019s youth, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\nBecause Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the murders, the trial court\ngave little weight to this factor. However, the sentencing opinion does not discuss\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony that the human brain does not finish developing until a\nperson reaches his mid-20s; in particular, Dr. Stinson testified that this is true of the\nfrontal lobe, which is responsible for \u201cjudgment, reasoning, impulse control, [and]\nplanning.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s opinion does not discuss this testimony,\nLawson asks us to infer that the panel did not consider it.\n        {\u00b6 119} But \u201c[w]hile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of\nmitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio\nSt.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). A trial court\u2019s failure to discuss each\nmitigating factor in its opinion does not give rise to an automatic inference that\nfactors that were not discussed in the opinion were not considered. Obermiller, 147\nOhio St.3d 175, 2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, at \u00b6 125, citing State v. Roberts,\n137 Ohio St.3d 230, 2013-Ohio-4580, 998 N.E.2d 1100, \u00b6 54.\n        {\u00b6 120} Such an inference is warranted only in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d\nRoberts at \u00b6 64, and Lawson points to no such circumstances here. In Roberts, the\ndefendant\u2019s allocution contained \u201cpotentially significant mitigation,\u201d id., and \u201cwas\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthe only relevant matter * * * specifically placed before the trial court as\nmitigation\u201d (emphasis sic), id. at \u00b6 56; in those circumstances, the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to mention the allocution in the sentencing opinion warranted the inference\nthat the court had failed to consider the allocution.       But in this case, as in\nObermiller, the sentencing opinion \u201cdiscussed multiple mitigating factors,\u201d\nObermiller at \u00b6 126. Therefore, the inference that the trial court failed to consider\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony is not justified.\n       {\u00b6 121} Lawson also contends that the trial court erred by \u201cunreasonably\ndiscount[ing]\u201d or giving \u201cinsufficient consideration to\u201d his mitigating evidence\ngoing to various other factors\u2014i.e., assigning it no weight or insufficient weight.\nLawson contends that a trial court violates the holding in Eddings and the Eighth\nAmendment by assigning insufficient weight to a defendant\u2019s mitigation.\n       {\u00b6 122} As we have explained, this reading of Eddings is incorrect because,\nas stated in Harris v. Alabama, 513 U.S. 504, 512, 115 S.Ct. 1031, 130 L.Ed.2d\n1004 (1995), \u201cthe Constitution does not require a State to ascribe any specific\nweight to particular factors, either in aggravation or mitigation, to be considered by\nthe sentencer.\u201d The weight to be given to any mitigating factor is \u201c \u2018an individual\ndecision by the fact finder,\u2019 \u201d not a matter of law. State v. Davis, 139 Ohio St.3d\n122, 2014-Ohio-1615, 9 N.E.3d 1031, \u00b6 62, quoting State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d\n353, 369-370, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992), abrogated in part on other grounds, see\nState v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 402-403, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997).\n       {\u00b6 123} Quoting Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 42, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175\nL.Ed.2d 398 (2009), Lawson describes it as a case in which the United States\nSupreme Court held that a state supreme court \u201c \u2018either did not consider or\nunreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence\u2019 adduced in a post-conviction\nhearing.\u201d   But \u201cPorter does not stand for the proposition that the Eighth\nAmendment forbids a sentencer to \u2018discount\u2019 mitigating evidence introduced at the\npenalty phase of the trial.\u201d Davis at \u00b6 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Therefore, we overrule Lawson\u2019s fourth proposition of law.\n                             VI. SETTLED ISSUES\n       {\u00b6 125} Lawson\u2019s fifth proposition of law raises various oft-rejected\narguments against the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes\ngoverning its imposition and also raises similar arguments that the death penalty\nviolates international law. See, e.g., State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-\nOhio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 106, 109-120; State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164,\n169-174, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984). We summarily overrule this proposition of law.\nSee generally State v. Poindexter, 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568 (1988),\nsyllabus; State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 81, 521 N.E.2d 800 (1988).\n                 VII. INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW\n       {\u00b6 126} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Lawson\u2019s\ndeath sentences. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine (1) whether the\nevidence supports the trier of fact\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, (2)\nwhether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty\noutweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) whether the\ndeath sentences are proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.\n                        A. Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 127} The aggravated murder of Stacey Holston (Count 1) has two\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)), and a felony-\nmurder circumstance predicated on aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)).\n       {\u00b6 128} The aggravated murder of D.H. (Count 2) has five aggravating\ncircumstances: murder of a victim under age 13 (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)); murder\ncommitted to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another\noffense (R.C 2929.04(A)(3)); course of conduct; felony murder predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder predicated on kidnapping.\n       {\u00b6 129} The aggravated murder of Tammie McGuire (Count 3) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 130} The aggravated murder of Donald McGuire (Count 4) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 131} The evidence in the record, including Lawson\u2019s confession,\nsupports the panel\u2019s finding as to each of the aggravating circumstances.\n                              B. Mitigating Factors\n       {\u00b6 132} Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh any of the\nrelevant mitigating factors provided in R.C. 2929.04(B). These factors include\n\u2022      the nature and circumstances of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      the history, character, and background of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it, R.C.\n       2929.04(B)(1),\n\u2022      whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for\n       the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation,\n       R.C. 2929.04(B)(2),\n\u2022      whether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a\n       mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the\n       criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct\n       to the requirements of the law, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3),\n\u2022      the youth of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4),\n\u2022      the offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and\n       delinquency adjudications, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5),\n\u2022      if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\n       the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim,\n          R.C. 2929.04(B)(6),\n\u2022         and any other factors that are relevant to the issue whether the offender\n          should be sentenced to death, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\n                                         1. Age\n          {\u00b6 133} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), \u201c[t]he youth of the offender\u201d is a\nmitigating factor. Lawson was born in 1994 and was 23 years old when he\ncommitted these murders. Lawson\u2019s age \u201cqualifies as a mitigating factor under\nR.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\u201d State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842\nN.E.2d 996, \u00b6 195.\n          {\u00b6 134} In the penalty phase, Lawson presented testimony from Dr.\nStinson, a forensic psychologist.       Dr. Stinson testified that the human brain\ncontinues to develop until a person reaches his mid-20s. He specifically noted that\nthe frontal lobe\u2014which is responsible for things like judgment, reasoning, impulse\ncontrol, and planning\u2014is the last part of the brain to develop and does not reach\nfull development until the mid-20s.\n                                2. Prior Criminal History\n          {\u00b6 135} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), \u201c[t]he offender\u2019s lack of a significant\nhistory of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications\u201d is a mitigating\nfactor.    The trial court found that Lawson has no previous convictions or\ndelinquency adjudications.\n                             3. Mental Disease or Defect\n          {\u00b6 136} The diminished-capacity mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), is\ninapplicable. Although Lawson has been diagnosed with various mental disorders,\nincluding bipolar disorder, Dr. Stinson did not testify that any of them deprived him\nof \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform\n[his] conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). The other\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nmitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B) that are not addressed in this opinion\nare likewise inapplicable.\n                     4. History, Character, and Background\n       {\u00b6 137} Lawson\u2019s history, character, and background constituted the heart\nof his case in mitigation. In the penalty phase, Lawson presented three witnesses:\nCarolyn Taylor, Stephanie Bentley, and Dr. Stinson. Carolyn Taylor is Lawson\u2019s\nmother. Stephanie Bentley is his half-sister and Carolyn\u2019s daughter. Dr. Stinson\ninterviewed Lawson for a total of 12 hours during four sessions and also\ninterviewed Lawson\u2019s mother. He reviewed information obtained by a mitigation\nspecialist who had conducted interviews of Lawson, his mother, his stepmother\nMartha Lawson, his half-sisters Stephanie Bentley and Summer Riesner, and others\nfamiliar with Lawson and his family. Dr. Stinson reviewed children\u2019s services,\neducational, employment, medical, mental-health, and jail records pertaining to\nLawson, records pertaining to Carolyn Taylor\u2019s family background and upbringing,\nand other records.\n       {\u00b6 138} Dr. Stinson identified 11 \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d\n(\u201cACEs\u201d) that place a child at risk for adverse health, mental-health, and social\noutcomes. They are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical\nneglect, emotional neglect, \u201cintimate partner violence,\u201d violence against the\nmother, \u201csubstance misuse in the household,\u201d parental divorce or separation,\nmental illness of a household member, and the incarceration of a household\nmember. Dr. Stinson testified that a research study conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention found that ACEs relate to approximately 40\nnegative outcomes. The presence of four or five ACEs indicates \u201csignificantly\nincreased risk for negative outcomes,\u201d and the likelihood of negative outcomes\nrises with the number of ACEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 139} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson had experienced \u201cat least\u201d nine\nACEs. The only two Dr. Stinson failed to definitively find were sexual abuse and\nphysical neglect.\n         {\u00b6 140} Lawson was born in April 1994. His parents are Delbert \u201cRay\u201d\nLawson and Carolyn Taylor. He was the third of five children Carolyn had by five\ndifferent men. Both of Lawson\u2019s parents have been divorced and remarried\nmultiple times. Carolyn has lived on welfare, food stamps, and Social Security\ndisability benefits.\n         {\u00b6 141} Ray and Carolyn lived together for about a month; when Carolyn\nbecame pregnant with Lawson, Ray left her. Carolyn lost custody of Lawson in\n1995. Ray denied his paternity until a DNA test proved that he was Lawson\u2019s\nfather; after that, he sought and was awarded custody of Lawson. According to Dr.\nStinson, Martha Lawson recalled that Carolyn had dropped Lawson off at Ray and\nMartha\u2019s house coatless in the middle of a winter night with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nturn.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 142} Lawson lived with Ray and Martha until he was 16. Also living in\nthe Lawson household were Ray and Martha\u2019s son Ray Jr. and Martha\u2019s son James\nMunyon. Carolyn was entitled to visitation with Lawson on Wednesdays and\nalternate weekends.    However, she testified that sometimes Ray and Martha\ndeprived Lawson of a visit as a punishment.\n         {\u00b6 143} While living with Ray and Martha, Lawson was especially close to\nhis paternal aunt, Linda McFann. Carolyn testified that Linda was \u201clike a second\nmom\u201d to him. Unfortunately, Linda died in a house fire. Carolyn testified that\nLawson was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Linda\u2019s death. Dr. Stinson testified that Linda died\nin 2006, when Lawson was about 12 years old. According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson\nstill had not \u201cresolved\u201d his bereavement five years later. At that time, a neighbor\ntold Lawson that he was glad Linda was dead, and Lawson responded by\n\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthreatening the neighbor with a butcher knife. Lawson was hospitalized at a\nmental-health facility after this incident.\n        {\u00b6 144} Lawson was also quite close to the boyfriend of one of his aunts,\nwhom he called \u201cUncle Tracy.\u201d Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Tracy was the most\npositive influence in his life. But Tracy died of a heroin overdose in about 2016.\n        {\u00b6 145} When Lawson was 16, Ray and Martha divorced, and Ray moved\nto Kentucky, leaving his children behind. Custody of Lawson then reverted to\nCarolyn, who had married Carl Kelly. A few months later, Carolyn and Kelly broke\nup, but Lawson continued to live with Kelly, whom Bentley described as like a\nfather to Lawson. Dr. Stinson believed that Kelly was generally a positive influence\non Lawson and may have provided \u201csome positive role modeling.\u201d On the other\nhand, Bentley testified that Kelly sold a lot of marijuana and provided some of it to\nLawson. After moving out, Carolyn maintained contact with Lawson, seeing him\nevery few days and talking to him on the phone.\n        {\u00b6 146} Dr. Stinson described the \u201ccomplicated family structure\u201d within\nwhich Lawson was raised. Ray left Lawson\u2019s mother to marry Martha, and\nLawson\u2019s mother had a relationship with Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon, who was\nthe father of Lawson\u2019s half-sister Stephanie Bentley. Lawson was teased in school\nbecause of this \u201cweird\u201d family situation. Additionally, Lawson\u2019s grandfather\nfathered a child with one of his daughters-in-law (Lawson\u2019s aunt by marriage); that\nchild was referred to as Lawson\u2019s \u201cUncle Cuz\u201d because he was both uncle and\ncousin to Lawson.\n        {\u00b6 147} Since at least age 11, Lawson has repeatedly alleged that his father,\nstepmother, and other family members abused him. He described his father as an\n\u201cabusive asshole\u201d who would get drunk and punch him.\n        {\u00b6 148} Carolyn testified that during visitations, she sometimes saw\nunexplained injuries on Lawson. Once she saw stitches in his head. She said that\nsomeone once squeezed Lawson\u2019s ears so tightly that they were severely bruised\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand had turned black. Bentley remembered seeing this as well, but she never saw\nany other bruising or injures. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Martha would pinch his\nears to the point of bruising and would strike him in the face.\n       {\u00b6 149} On one occasion, Carolyn testified, a dark orange substance was\ndraining from Lawson\u2019s ear. Carolyn recalled that when she took Lawson to a\ndoctor to treat his ear, the doctor said that it looked as if someone had jabbed the\nmetal end of a pencil into Lawson\u2019s ear after removing the eraser.\n       {\u00b6 150} Dr. Stinson testified that according to the medical records he\nreviewed, there were two cases of drainage from Lawson\u2019s ears. The first instance\nof \u201cbloody drainage\u201d occurred when Lawson was three; almost a year later, Lawson\nexperienced the orange discharge that had been described by Carolyn from the same\near.   According to Dr. Stinson, medical records documented that Lawson\u2019s\nstepbrother, James Munyon, had shoved pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears; however, Dr.\nStinson did not make clear whether this behavior had caused the discharges.\n       {\u00b6 151} Dr. Stinson admitted that to his knowledge, no specific instances of\nabuse against Lawson had ever been substantiated. And although Dr. Stinson\nbelieved that Lawson was a victim of abuse, he eventually conceded that he did not\nknow whether Lawson had been abused. (Dr. Stinson did not classify the alleged\ninsertion of pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears as a type of \u201cabuse.\u201d)\n       {\u00b6 152} Dr. Stinson also testified that Lawson reported abuse \u201cover and\nover and over to people who did nothing.\u201d Dr. Stinson felt that the fact that\nLawson\u2019s claims went unheeded was actually \u201cmore relevant\u201d than whether he\nactually was abused, because it contributed to his feelings of being unloved:\n\n\n       We can look back on it and say \u201cWell, it * * * really wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n       From my standpoint what\u2019s more relevant is the fact that once he\n       reported his abuse, nobody did anything about it * * * and he\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       internalized [the belief that] nobody cares, nobody\u2019s going to protect\n       me, nobody loves me and I\u2019m unlovable.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 153} Lawson did tell his mother that he was being abused, and his\nmedical records showed that he reported past abuse to medical-health professionals\nduring his treatment sessions.\n       {\u00b6 154} However, when Lawson first alleged to authorities that he was\nbeing abused, the authorities did not ignore it; they investigated and found no\nevidence to support the claim. The penalty-phase evidence includes records for\nLawson and his family from the Lawrence County Department of Job and Family\nServices that were admitted as a court\u2019s exhibit. Those records include a children\u2019s\nservices report showing that Ray and Martha were investigated in 2006 after\nLawson reported to the Ironton police that he was being abused.\n       {\u00b6 155} According to the records, Lawson alleged that his stepmother\nslapped his face, his siblings \u201cput erasers in his ears,\u201d and his parents \u201chit him\neverywhere.\u201d But the investigator found only one small bruise on Lawson\u2019s knee,\nand that appeared to the investigator to be normal for a preteen child and to not\nhave been deliberately inflicted.\n       {\u00b6 156} The investigator learned that Lawson\u2019s father had recently spanked\nhim with a belt; however, the spanking was inflicted as a punishment after Lawson\nchoked his brother, Ray Jr., during a squabble. Martha told the investigator that\nLawson had expressed a desire \u201cto get his father in trouble like he was in trouble\nfrom choking\u201d his brother.\n       {\u00b6 157} Although Lawson has never reported that he was sexually abused\nand in fact has denied it, Dr. Stinson nonetheless suspected that Lawson may have\nbeen sexually abused as a child. He based this suspicion on the existence of\n\u201crampant\u201d sexual abuse in Lawson\u2019s family over the years. Carolyn\u2019s oldest son\nwas allegedly sexually abused and went on to abuse two sisters and a cousin.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLawson\u2019s stepbrother was sexually abused by a neighbor. One of Lawson\u2019s half-\nsisters was sexually abused by Carolyn\u2019s brother-in-law. A generation before,\nCarolyn\u2019s family members had been involved in numerous allegations of sexual\nabuse. Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson may have denied being sexually abused\nbecause it was so common as to become \u201cnormalized\u201d in his family.\n       {\u00b6 158} Lawson\u2019s mother, Carolyn Taylor, was raised in poverty; her\nfamily was dependent on welfare and food stamps, and the children were\nmalnourished. Carolyn grew up in a trailer that housed 12 people. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that \u201cthere were concerns that the boys and the girls were sharing bedrooms\nand sleeping together.\u201d The home was leaky and roach-infested and had no indoor\nbathroom.\n       {\u00b6 159} During Carolyn\u2019s childhood, numerous allegations of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were leveled against her parents and stepparents;\nmany of them were against her father in particular.             Children\u2019s services\ninvestigators were able to substantiate some of these allegations, but according to\nDr. Stinson, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, Dr. Stinson\ntestified that the \u201cremarkable\u201d number of allegations said a great deal about the\nculture of Carolyn\u2019s family.\n       {\u00b6 160} Dr. Stinson also stated that Carolyn suffered from \u201csignificant\nmental health problems.\u201d Documented symptoms he listed included agitation,\nanhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities), anxiety, crying spells,\ndisorganized thought, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, homicidal and\nsuicidal thoughts, hyperactivity, paranoia, panic attacks, phobic avoidance,\npreoccupation, self-mutilation, and feelings of worthlessness.          Her \u201cmood\ndisturbance\u201d manifested itself in the forms of severe depression, anger, euphoria,\nirritability, mania, and \u201cmixed moods,\u201d i.e., simultaneous symptoms of depression\nand mania.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 161} Dr. Stinson related that Carolyn had been diagnosed with anxiety\ndisorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, \u201cmoderate and recurrent\u201d major depressive\ndisorder, various forms of bipolar disorder including \u201cmixed [simultaneously manic\nand depressive] severe, with psychotic features,\u201d and schizoaffective disorder, a\npsychotic disorder combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She had been\ntreated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. Carolyn\u2019s\ndoctor had determined that her mental disorders left her \u201cfunctionally impaired,\u201d\nunable to carry on day-to-day activities. The Social Security Administration had\nfound that she was \u201cpermanently impaired and unable to engage in any gainful\nactivity.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 162} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson also had three relatives\u2014an\nuncle, aunt, and great-uncle\u2014who had attempted suicide. And Lawson described\na maternal half-brother as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and as having delusions. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that severe mental-health problems have a genetic component, so that the\nchildren of parents with severe mental-health problems are particularly at risk to\ninherit them.\n        {\u00b6 163} Lawson has in fact had mental-health problems and has been\ndiagnosed with mental disorders since childhood. Most significantly, in March\n2011, shortly before he turned 17, Lawson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and\nbipolar disorder. In April of that year, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at\nMercy Franciscan Hospital after a violent incident with his neighbor. Hospital staff\nmembers believed that past abuse had contributed to his emotional difficulties.\n        {\u00b6 164} Lawson continued to receive mental-health evaluations and\ntreatment in 2011 and 2012. During one psychiatric examination, he said he was\nhaving flashbacks to past abuse. In 2012, Lawson was hospitalized again because\nhe was contemplating injuring his neighbor.\n        {\u00b6 165} Since 2011, Lawson has been diagnosed repeatedly with depressive\ndisorder and PTSD. Dr. Stinson testified that when he interviewed Lawson, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nexhibited classic symptoms of depression and PTSD.                 Despite previous\nhospitalizations, Dr. Stinson testified, Lawson did not receive the kind of treatment\nhe needed.\n        {\u00b6 166} Lawson has had anger issues dating back to his childhood. During\nthe 2006 children\u2019s services investigation, the investigating social worker wrote\nthat she was concerned about Lawson\u2019s inability to control his anger. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that Lawson was enrolled in an anger-management class at age 13 because\nhe was unable to regulate his emotions; however, his stepmother removed him\nbecause the class took time away from his chores and homework. At age 16, he\nwas diagnosed with \u201canger disorder.\u201d Dr. Stinson noted that \u201cthere is no such thing\nas anger disorder,\u201d but he interpreted this diagnosis to mean that Lawson had a\nmood disorder in which anger was predominant.\n        {\u00b6 167} A consistent factor in Lawson\u2019s personality has been his repeatedly\nexpressed feelings that he was worthless; he described himself to Dr. Stinson as\nfeeling like \u201cjust a piece of crap\u201d and \u201clike a dog.\u201d Schoolmates made fun of his\nfamily and his first name. (His mother meant to name him \u201cAaron,\u201d but she\nmisspelled it as \u201cArron\u201d on his birth certificate. His preferred pronunciation is \u201cAr-\nron,\u201d with the emphasis on the second syllable, but people frequently mispronounce\nit.)   Bentley testified that Martha favored her own children over Lawson.\nAccording to Dr. Stinson, Lawson used marijuana to deal with feelings of\nemptiness and worthlessness.\n        {\u00b6 168} Lawson\u2019s family has an extensive history of drug and alcohol\nproblems. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that his father, Ray, was \u201cdrunk all the time.\u201d\nBentley testified that Ray drank \u201c[e]very day, all day long.\u201d Carolyn told Dr.\nStinson that Ray was \u201ca real bad drunk.\u201d During the period when Lawson lived\nwith Ray and Martha, Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon was released from prison and\nmoved into the household. Dr. Stinson testified that Munyon not only smoked\nmarijuana but traded it for sex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Despite Lawson\u2019s family history, Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson\nhimself did not have \u201csevere drug and alcohol problems.\u201d But Dr. Stinson stated\nthat Lawson did use marijuana and other drugs to cope with physical pain and\nemotional distress. Bentley testified that Lawson smoked marijuana frequently or\ndaily. Dr. Stinson diagnosed Lawson with a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d but he\nconceded that this disorder caused no major impairment of Lawson\u2019s functioning.\nThere was no evidence that Lawson had been using alcohol or drugs at the time of\nthe aggravated murders in this case.\n       {\u00b6 170} Lawson had numerous medical problems throughout his life.\nWhen he was two, a dog bit him on the cheek, although Carolyn testified that the\ninjury was not serious. At the age of three, he had a laceration to the forehead,\nrequiring stitches, and had skin-cancer surgery. At the age of four, his tongue was\nclipped twice to correct a speech impediment. Both the skin-cancer surgery and\nthe tongue clipping were outpatient procedures. At the age of 12, while playing\nwith his siblings, he was shot in one eye with an \u201cairsoft\u201d gun (similar to a BB gun,\nbut firing plastic or rubber pellets), causing temporary blindness in that eye. Dr.\nStinson testified that Lawson has continued to have \u201cvision problems\u201d since that\ninjury. In addition, Lawson\u2019s gallbladder was removed in 2010.\n       {\u00b6 171} In 2011, Lawson suffered multiple medical problems. Severe\nheadaches required several doctor and hospital visits.        He also experienced\ndegenerative disc disease, abdominal pain, and \u201cabnormal findings related to his\ncolon and appendix.\u201d In 2017, Lawson was in a \u201cfender-bender\u201d accident and\nstruck his head on a rear-view mirror. While he did not seek medical attention at\nthe time, he experienced chronic headaches after the accident.\n       {\u00b6 172} In addition to the above factors, Lawson expressed remorse for the\nmurders in his confession and in his unsworn statement. He told the panel, \u201cI know\nwhat I did was wrong\u201d and stated that he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for what he did. He\napologized to everyone he had harmed, including the four murder victims and his\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nown family. He said that he cannot sleep at night, cries all the time, cries himself\nto sleep, and has flashbacks. He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t expect sympathy. * * * If it\nbe death penalty, then I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m at peace with whatever you give me.\u201d\nLawson also expressed his remorse to Dr. Stinson, who felt that Lawson\u2019s remorse\nwas sincere.\n       {\u00b6 173} Dr. Stinson testified about Lawson\u2019s conduct in the Morrow\nCounty jail, where he was held pending trial. A jail supervisor described Lawson\nto Dr. Stinson as trustworthy, well behaved, respectful, and \u201cnot * * * a problem.\u201d\nOther correctional officers consistently told Dr. Stinson that Lawson was not\ncausing any problems.      Whenever Dr. Stinson saw Lawson interacting with\nofficers, they seemed to have a tension-free and professional relationship. On one\noccasion, Lawson gave jail staff members advance warning that several other\ninmates were planning to disrupt jail operations by flooding their toilets.\n       {\u00b6 174} Lawson\u2019s jail records showed two \u201cwrite-ups\u201d in the approximately\n16 months he was there. In January 2018, he got upset about a lockdown, kicked a\ndoor, and threatened an officer; he lost all privileges as a result. Dr. Stinson\ndescribed the other incident as \u201cequivocal.\u201d A Lawrence County deputy sheriff\nwho was transporting Lawson accused him of resisting him and of disrespect and\ndisobedience; however, a Morrow County deputy stated that there had been no\nproblem. Lawson was not disciplined for this incident. Overall, Dr. Stinson opined\nthat when compared to other inmates he had worked with, Lawson had adjusted to\nincarceration \u201crelatively\u201d well, even \u201cremarkably well.\u201d\n                   5. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n       {\u00b6 175} The trial court gleaned one mitigating factor from the\ncircumstances of the offense: while in the Holstons\u2019 house on the day of the\nmurders, Lawson fed two-year-old B.H., changed his diaper, and put him down for\na nap. Beyond that, nothing about the nature and circumstances of the offenses in\nthis case could be considered mitigating.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                     C. Weighing\n          {\u00b6 176} We must determine whether the aggravating circumstances that\nwere found by the three-judge panel outweigh the mitigating factors presented in\nthis case beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.05(A) and 2929.03(D)(1); see State\nv. Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, \u00b6 140. We\ndetermine that they do.\n          {\u00b6 177} Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is the strongest mitigating factor in\nthis case.     At various times, Lawson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,\ndepression, and PTSD, and he did not receive adequate treatment for these\ndisorders. See State v. Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3d\n841, \u00b6 209. We note in particular that bipolar disorder is \u201ca major mental illness.\u201d\nKetterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 205. Although\nDr. Stinson did not testify that the murders were attributable to Lawson\u2019s mental\ndisorders, we find that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is entitled to substantial\nweight.\n          {\u00b6 178} We must consider Lawson\u2019s youth as a mitigating factor. See R.C.\n2929.04(B)(4). This court has frequently upheld death sentences for 23-year-old\nmurderers and has ordinarily given the (B)(4) factor little weight in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at \u00b6 195\n(\u201clittle weight\u201d); State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d\n1173, \u00b6 173 (\u201cmodest weight\u201d); State v. Ferguson, 108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-\n1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b6 127 (\u201clittle weight\u201d). We recognize that we recently\naccorded \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the age of an offender in Graham, id. at \u00b6 207.\nHowever, Graham is fundamentally distinguishable. Graham had just turned 19 at\nthe time he committed aggravated murder, a little more than one year removed from\nthe minimum age for death-penalty eligibility. In contrast, Lawson was 23 when\nhe committed the murders at issue here, a more significant passage of time from\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe minimum age of eligibility. Therefore, we consider Lawson\u2019s youth to be a\nfactor that carries some weight.\n       {\u00b6 179} The evidence that Lawson was abused is not conclusive. The\nrecord does show, however, that Lawson experienced a degree of instability in his\nupbringing, with several changes in custody and living arrangements. The evidence\nalso shows that he was surrounded by poor role models and had few good role\nmodels and that he felt unloved and worthless.\n       {\u00b6 180} Because Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the four\naggravated murders in this case, he had at least some \u201ctime to distance himself from\nhis childhood and allow other factors to assert themselves in his personality and his\nbehavior,\u201d State v. Campbell, 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 53, 765 N.E.2d 334 (2002);\ncompare Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, at \u00b6 138\n(19-year-old offender was \u201cnot far removed\u201d from his upbringing).\n       {\u00b6 181} Yet we have \u201cseldom ascribed much weight in mitigation to a\ndefendant\u2019s unstable or troubled childhood.\u201d State v. Kirkland, 160 Ohio St.3d 389,\n2020-Ohio-4079, 157 N.E.3d 716, \u00b6 174, citing Campbell at 51-54; see also State\nv. Cooey, 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 41, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989). And Lawson\u2019s childhood\nsurely presents nothing comparable to State v. Tenace, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-\nOhio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, which we have noted as \u201c[t]he benchmark case for\nassessing the weight of childhood trauma\u201d based on its \u201cappalling facts,\u201d State v.\nBeasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-493, 108 N.E.3d 1028, \u00b6 248. The\ndefendant in Tenace was raised by criminal and drug-addicted parents, sold by his\nmother for sexual services, forced to watch his sister being sexually abused, and\nencouraged to cheat and steal. Tenace at \u00b6 102-103. Therefore, Lawson\u2019s history\nand background are entitled to some weight, \u201cbut only to the extent his \u2018criminal\n* * * acts are attributable to\u2019 it,\u201d Campbell at 53, quoting California v. Brown, 479\nU.S. 538, 545, 2017 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Although retrospective remorse is ordinarily not a strong mitigating\nfactor, \u201cremorse [that] leads to surrender and confession is a more impressive\nfactor.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 93, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991). In this case,\nLawson did surrender\u2014although that decision may have been influenced by a cold\nnight in the woods without supplies, shelter, or weapons. More importantly,\nLawson gave a complete, truthful confession that aided the police with their crime-\nscene investigation. Therefore, we find that Lawson\u2019s remorse and cooperation are\nentitled to some weight in mitigation. His generally good conduct in jail is also\nentitled to some weight.\n       {\u00b6 183} With respect to D.H.\u2019s murder, the aggravating circumstances\ninclude that Lawson engaged in a course of conduct\u2014i.e., committed multiple\nmurders\u2014and the fact that D.H. was younger than 13. \u201cIn particular, the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it\ninvolves the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 328. And the cold-blooded nature\nand details of D.H.\u2019s murder are especially significant concerns. Moreover, the\ncommission of multiple murders is a grave aggravating circumstance that carries\ngreat weight. State v. Hutton, 100 Ohio St.3d 176, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d\n948, \u00b6 91.   The two felony-murder circumstances and the escaping-detection\ncircumstance add still more weight to the state\u2019s side of the scales.\n       {\u00b6 184} The murders of Stacey and her parents lack the child-murder\naggravating circumstance, but each has a course-of-conduct and a felony-murder\ncircumstance. In addition, the murders of Stacey\u2019s parents have the escaping-\ndetection circumstance.\n       {\u00b6 185} Two recent cases in which we have found that aggravation did not\noutweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, Johnson and Graham, each\ninvolved 19-year-old defendants, both of whom \u201centered a residence to commit\nrobbery and killed a [single] person inside.\u201d Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio-6700, 172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 215. By contrast, Lawson was 23 years old; he\nentered the Holstons\u2019 residence and lay in wait specifically to kill; over a period of\n12 hours, he killed four people, one an eight-year-old child who should not even\nhave been in the house, and he attempted to kill a fifth.\n        {\u00b6 186} This case invites particular comparison with Graham, which it\nresembles in that both Lawson and Graham were young defendants who suffered\nfrom untreated or insufficiently treated mental-health issues and adverse\nenvironmental factors. See Graham at \u00b6 196. In fact, Lawson\u2019s mental disorders\u2014\nbipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety\u2014are more significant than\nGraham\u2019s oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, see id.\n        {\u00b6 187} However, this case is distinguishable from Graham in numerous\nimportant ways. We have already noted some of the key distinctions: Lawson was\nfour years older than Graham was when the crimes were committed; Lawson killed\nfour people to Graham\u2019s one; one of Lawson\u2019s victims was eight years old and that\ninnocent victim was in the house only because of Lawson\u2019s deception; Lawson\nentered the house where the crimes occurred with the express purpose of\ncommitting murder, unlike Graham, who entered for the purpose of robbery with\nno intention to kill anyone. And the list goes on.\n        {\u00b6 188} While Graham was the principal offender in the aggravated murder\nhe committed, he \u201cwas not the mastermind,\u201d 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700,\n172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 205, of the drug robbery that led to the murder; he was\nrecruited by a friend. In this case, Lawson was not just the principal offender; he\nwas the sole offender. Nobody recruited or enticed him; the whole thing was his\nidea.\n        {\u00b6 189} The murder in Graham was a quick reaction to events during the\nrobbery: Graham told the victim not to look at the robbers, the victim expressed\ndoubt that Graham would shoot him, and Graham shot him. Id. at \u00b6 12. In contrast,\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nLawson planned and prepared for Stacey\u2019s murder well in advance and committed\nfour murders over a 12-hour period in which the death toll mounted.\n         {\u00b6 190} Like Lawson, Graham used marijuana daily. But unlike Lawson,\nGraham was also addicted to Xanax, using \u201cmassive\u201d daily amounts of it, Graham\nat \u00b6 199. Moreover, Graham\u2019s Xanax use made him more irritable and aggressive\nand less inhibited. Id. at \u00b6 199, 210. Indeed, Graham\u2019s expert witness testified that\nit was unlikely that Graham would have committed the murder but for his Xanax\naddiction. Id. at \u00b6 199. Lawson had a cannabis-use disorder, but according to Dr.\nStinson it caused no major impairment of his functioning, and there is no evidence\nthat drug use played any role in the murders in this case.\n         {\u00b6 191} This case is undeniably one in which the defendant has presented\nsignificant mitigating factors. But this is also a case in which the defendant\nslaughtered four people, including the callous slaying of an eight-year-old child.\nWith respect to each of the four aggravated murders before us, we find that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n                                D. Proportionality\n         {\u00b6 192} We further determine that the death sentences for these crimes are\nproportionate to sentences approved in similar cases. We have approved death\nsentences in cases combining multiple murders with one or more child murders.\nState v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051; State v.\nPowell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865; Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242; Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347,\n2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180. Indeed, we have approved death sentences in\nnumerous cases that involved multiple murders when all the victims were adults.\nSee, e.g., State v. Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, 89 N.E.3d 554\n(two murders, one attempted murder); Beasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n493, 108 N.E.3d 1028 (three murders, one attempted murder); State v. Madison,\n160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867 (three murders).\n                              VIII. CONCLUSION\n       {\u00b6 193} We affirm the judgments of conviction. We further affirm all four\nsentences of death.\n                                                                Judgment affirmed.\n       FISCHER and DEWINE, JJ., concur.\n       DONNELLY, J., concurs, with an opinion.\n       O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in judgment only and concurs in Justice\nDonnelly\u2019s concurring opinion.\n       STEWART, J., concurs in part and dissents in part and would reverse the\ndeath sentences.\n       BRUNNER, J., dissents, with an opinion.\n                               _________________\n       DONNELLY, J., concurring.\n       {\u00b6 194} Respectfully, I fully concur with this court\u2019s judgment affirming\nappellant Arron L. Lawson\u2019s convictions. I reluctantly concur, however, with this\ncourt\u2019s judgment affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentence.\n       {\u00b6 195} Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder, and depression, there is no denying that Lawson suffers from serious\nmental illnesses and that he did not receive adequate treatment for these disorders.\nOf these diagnoses, bipolar disorder has been found to be a major mental illness.\nSee State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 172,\n205. The majority opinion recognizes that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history was\nsubstantial and accorded it the mitigating factor entitled to the strongest weight.\nSee majority opinion at \u00b6 177. The General Assembly has also recognized the\ncritical importance of this issue, see 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, which became\neffective during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        54\n\f                                     January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 196} As of April 12, 2021, a person who has been diagnosed with a\n\u201cserious mental illness\u201d\u2014including bipolar disorder\u2014is ineligible for a death\nsentence, R.C. 2929.025(E)(1), when the defendant timely raises the issue and\nproves by a preponderance of the evidence, R.C. 2929.025(D)(1), that the illness\n\u201csignificantly impaired the person\u2019s capacity to exercise rational judgment,\u201d\n2929.025(A)(1)(b), with respect to either conforming to the law or appreciating the\nnature,     consequences,    or      wrongfulness         of   the   person\u2019s      conduct,\n2929.025(A)(1)(b)(i) and (ii). Because Lawson was sentenced before the effective\ndate of 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, he has one year after its effective date to seek\na   postconviction     remedy,       R.C.    2953.21(A)(2)(b).         See      also   R.C.\n2953.21(A)(1)(a)(iv) and 2953.21(A)(3)(a), as amended. Notwithstanding our\njudgment today, the postconviction statutes leave a door open for Lawson.\n          O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n                                  _________________\n          BRUNNER, J., dissenting.\n          {\u00b6 197} Testing the competency of persons accused of capital crimes is\ncritical to affording the degree of due process guaranteed by the Ohio and federal\nConstitutions and fulfills the proscription found in the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution against cruel and unusual punishment.                  Drope v.\nMissouri, 420 U.S. 162, 174-175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002). In short,\nensuring that a defendant is competent to stand trial is necessary to protect the right\nto a fair trial. Drope at 174-175.\n          {\u00b6 198} However, determining competency and the mental condition of an\naccused is not just an exercise that is relevant to trial participation. Competency\nmust also be established to convict, see Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378, 86\nS.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), and execute, see Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S.\n399, 410, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) an accused. The United States\n\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court has also prohibited the execution of severely mentally impaired\ndefendants, finding the execution of those defendants excessive and violative of a\nnumber of public policies concerning capital punishment. Atkins at 321. The\nUnited States Supreme Court has also prohibited the execution of juveniles,\nrecognizing their developmental immaturity and diminished culpability. Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-571, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). In Ohio,\nthe General Assembly has recently prohibited the imposition of the death penalty\nfor the crime of aggravated murder when the defendant had a serious mental illness\nat the time that he committed the offense. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.02(A), 2929.025,\nand other statutes enacted in 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136. This case is therefore\nabout more than whether appellant, Arron Lawson, was able to consult with his\nlawyers and reasonably understand the proceedings against him. This appeal is an\nopportunity for this court to reexamine the protections and precautions that are\ncentral to ensuring that any death sentence that is imposed is appropriate and\nsubjected to a reliable, deliberate, and rigorous constitutional review.\n       {\u00b6 199} Former Justice Paul Pfeifer stated when he served as a justice of\nthis court that \u201c[t]he death penalty should be reserved for the most severe of cases.\u201d\nState v. Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 75, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (1999) (Pfeifer, J.,\ndissenting); see also State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 563, 747 N.E.2d 765\n(2001) (Pfeifer, J., dissenting) (the death penalty should be imposed only on \u201cthose\nmurderers who truly deserve death\u201d).           It is difficult to imagine Lawson\u2019s\nhorrendous acts not falling into the category of the worst of cases. But this court is\nconstitutionally bound to not only review Lawson\u2019s sentence but also to verify the\nintegrity of the process leading to the imposition of the death penalty as the\npunishment for his crimes. This should not be a mechanistic analysis; it should be\na thorough endeavor that closely examines all aspects of the proceedings that have\nculminated in our review. Because there are too many unaddressed concerns in the\nmajority\u2019s analysis, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n   I. Lawson\u2019s Competency to Enter Guilty Pleas and Waive a Jury Trial\n            A. A trial court\u2019s duty regarding a defendant\u2019s competency\n       {\u00b6 200} When the issue of competency is \u201craised\u201d before trial by counsel\nfor a criminal defendant, by the prosecution, or by the court, a hearing on the matter\nis mandatory. R.C. 2945.37(B); State v. Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016 (1986). Likewise, after the conclusion of the trial-court proceedings, if a\nperson who was convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death wanted to forgo\nfurther legal challenges, essentially volunteering for death, this court has required\nthat the person undergo a competency evaluation and that the trial court hold a\nhearing before such a request would be honored. See State v. Berry, 74 Ohio St.3d\n1492, 658 N.E.2d 1062 (1996) (ordering that an independent psychiatric expert be\nappointed); State v. Berry, 77 Ohio St.3d 1439, 671 N.E.2d 1279 (1996) (remanding\nthe matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on mental competency). For\nthe period of litigation lying between the two markers of a death-penalty\nproceeding\u2014i.e., before the trial and during or following the sentencing (such as\nforgoing an appeal or forgoing other legal challenges)\u2014there are points at which a\ndefendant\u2019s decision or request may or is likely to be an indicator that his\ncompetency to assist in his own defense should be determined pursuant to R.C.\n2945.37(G), such as when a defendant indicates his or her wish to terminate\ncounsel\u2019s representation, when a defendant indicates his or her wish to waive a jury\ntrial, and when a defendant indicates his or her wish to forgo the presentation of all\nor some mitigating evidence at sentencing.         These pivotal points along the\ncontinuum of a death-penalty prosecution are critical events that could serve in\nwhole or in part to tip the scales of justice toward or away from the ultimate\npunishment\u2014death.\n       {\u00b6 201} Therefore, it is understood that R.C. 2945.37(B) dictates that when\nrequested before trial, a competency examination is mandatory and that when a\ndefendant wishes to waive the ability to challenge an imposed death sentence, a\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncompetency hearing is required, see State v. Berry, 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 375, 686\nN.E.2d 1097 (1997).      However, clear guidelines are lacking about the way\ncompetency should be questioned and examined in the stages that occur between\nthe period before the start of a trial and the final imposition of a death sentence.\nThus, trial courts have been free to apply whatever standards they choose during\nthose stages, and their decisions are not overturned on appeal unless there are\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d in the record, State v. Were, 94 Ohio St.3d\n173, 761 N.E.2d 591 (2002), paragraph two of the syllabus. This court has stated\nthat \u201c \u2018[c]ommon sense dictates that no defendant can make a record of lack of\ncompetency absent the findings and hearings contemplated by R.C. 2945.37 and\n2945.371.\u2019 \u201d Were at 177, quoting Bock at 113 (Wright, J., dissenting). Thus,\nrelying on a record when there is no requirement to create one is hardly the model\nof fair process, and it cannot in any sense be deemed rigorously constitutional.\n                   B. Indicia of incompetency in Lawson\u2019s case\n       {\u00b6 202} Lawson has raised three areas of concern that, taken together,\nshould be held to have triggered the trial court\u2019s duty to order a pretrial\nincompetency exam: when Lawson acted against the advice of his counsel by\nwaiving a trial and entering guilty pleas, when Lawson exhibited indecisiveness\nabout his decision to enter guilty pleas, and when Lawson revealed to the court that\nhe was taking prescription medications. Going against the advice of counsel, alone,\ndoes not equate with incompetence. Indecisiveness, alone, may not necessarily\nconstitute a clear indicator that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Nor may\ntaking prescription medications, standing alone, be a clear indicator of\nincompetence. Our inquiry in this appeal, however, is not whether we believe that\nLawson was competent; it is whether these factors taken together should be held to\nreasonably indicate to a trial court that further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s\ncompetency is required, to ensure the fairness of the proceeding, especially in a\ncapital case. See R.C. 2945.37(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                      January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 203} There were indicia, i.e., signs or indications, that should have\nprompted\u2014and did prompt\u2014the trial court to further inquire about concerns of\npossible \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d regarding Lawson\u2019s competency to\nwaive a trial and change his pleas. On multiple occasions, the trial court raised the\nissue of a possible competency evaluation.1 The record is clear that the presiding\ntrial judge was hesitating and \u201csecond-guessing\u201d whether the types of\nconsiderations underlying Atkins, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335,\nand other precedents had been observed or applied. The trial judge appeared\nhesitant about Lawson\u2019s thought process in making the grave and weighty decision\nto plead guilty in a proceeding that could carry the consequential punishment of\ndeath.\n         {\u00b6 204} Lawson\u2019s actions in waiving his right to a jury trial and entering\npleas of guilty to multiple capital offenses, combined with the trial court\u2019s\nhesitations, were indicia of incompetency that do exist in our limited record,\nconsidering that no competency examination or hearing ever occurred. It should\nnot be our role to guess from the evidence what Lawson\u2019s state of mind was and\ntherefore what his mental capabilities were.                If he had been assessed for\ncompetency, we would be able to read a report from a mental-health professional\nabout his ability and state of mind. Without that kind of evidence, it is difficult to\ndiscern from the record whether Lawson was exercising the rights of a rational,\nmentally and physically healthy person in making this decision. See Berry, 80 Ohio\nSt.3d at 375, 686 N.E.2d 1097, quoting Smith v. Armentrout, 812 F.2d 1050, 1057\n(8th Cir.1987) (it is \u201c \u2018very probable\u2019 \u201d that in \u201c \u2018every case\u2019 \u201d in which a capital\n\n\n1. The majority opinion outlines the discussions between the trial judge and counsel regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency, including an in-chambers discussion on February 11, 2019. During that\ndiscussion, the trial judge noted that he had \u201cbrought this [issue] up months ago\u201d and was now\n\u201csecond-guessing\u201d his decision to decline to order a competency evaluation. Further discussion in\nthe record occurred on February 21, 2019, when the presiding trial judge asked counsel whether\nthey had any concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d and\ninquired as to counsel\u2019s investigation of those issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                               59\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant desires to \u201c \u2018abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility\nthat the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect\u2019 \u201d). That we\nwould guess or infer what a competency evaluation would have shown debases our\nunique role in reviewing death-penalty appeals.\n       {\u00b6 205} The record is clear that when the trial court during the plea colloquy\nasked Lawson whether his mental clarity was affected by any medications, Lawson\ndisclosed that he was taking several\u2014naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and\nZoloft. The trial court questioned Lawson and defense counsel regarding these\nmedications and asked whether they could be affecting Lawson\u2019s ability to reason\nor his judgment. And while there is no affirmative indication in the record that\nLawson\u2019s medications did affect his ability to understand or reason, more inquiry\ncertainly was in order. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 174-175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103 (discussing whether, in light of inferences drawn from the undisputed evidence,\nthe trial court\u2019s failure to further inquire into a defendant\u2019s competency deprived\nhim of a fair trial). Unanswered questions remained: Why was he taking those\nmedications? How long had he been taking those medications? What medical\ndiagnoses and symptoms indicated that those medications should be prescribed?\nWas he experiencing or had he ever experienced any side effects from those\nmedications, including drowsiness, confusion, or suicidal thoughts? A competency\nexam could have provided answers to these questions to allay concerns regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency.       Lawson\u2019s statement that he was taking prescription\nmedications was, at a minimum, a legitimate factor relating to the fundamental\nquestion of his competency to stand trial and to decide to plead guilty to capital\nmurder.\n       {\u00b6 206} The majority, citing State v. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717\nN.E.2d 298 (1999), reasons that the trial court and defense counsel were able to\nobserve Lawson and that he exhibited no behavior that raised any question as to his\ncompetency. There are a number of reasons why licensed members of the legal\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nprofession and the judiciary should not perform competency evaluations based on\ntheir own observations, either directly or indirectly by reading a record. Using this\nmethod to make what amounts to a medical determination that a person charged\nwith a capital crime is or was competent is not only constitutionally flawed, it is\nunacceptable. This is particularly so when there is evidence that a defendant is\ntaking prescription medications that may affect his or her behavior or demeanor.2\nNo one asked Lawson whether drowsiness or confusion might be a side effect of\nany of his medications.           No one asked Lawson whether any of his current\nmedications were prescribed for impulse control. No one asked Lawson whether\nhe was depressed or suicidal. And no one asked him on the record why he was\nchoosing to plead guilty to capital offenses.\n         {\u00b6 207} Lawson\u2019s decision to waive a trial and enter pleas of guilty in this\ncapital case, combined with the trial court\u2019s apparent misgivings as they appear in\nthe record, support that further inquiry into Lawson\u2019s competency was necessary.\nI would thus reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment based on this issue and would\nremand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings regarding Lawson\u2019s\ncompetency.\n  C. R.C. 2945.37(B) requires a hearing when the issue of competency is raised\n         {\u00b6 208} The majority rejects Lawson\u2019s argument that R.C. 2945.37(B)\nrequired a competency hearing in this case, concluding that the issue was not\nsufficiently raised at trial and that, even if it had been, not raising it was harmless\nerror. When \u201cthe issue of the defendant\u2019s competence\u201d to stand trial is \u201craised\u201d\nbefore the trial has begun, \u201cthe court shall hold a hearing on the issue.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) R.C. 2945.37(B). The statute does not require the issue to be sufficiently\n\n\n2. According to information available on the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website, drowsiness is a side effect\nof most of the medications Lawson was taking; confusion is a side effect of Vistaril and\nmetronidazole; and suicidal thoughts, loss of memory, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality\nare side effects of Zoloft. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs (accessed July 9, 2021)\n[https://perma.cc/UL5E-XLDS].\n\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nraised, raised by motion, or raised with the intention of obtaining or ordering a\nhearing. See id. (\u201cthe court, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue\u201d).\n        {\u00b6 209} On multiple occasions before the trial began, the trial court itself\nraised the issue whether a competency evaluation should be done. See fn. 1 of this\nopinion, supra. The majority interprets the record to indicate that the trial-court\njudge was merely asking the defense whether it wanted a competency hearing. But\nisn\u2019t it just as plausible that the trial judge was truly questioning whether there was\nenough information available to reach a sound conclusion that Lawson was\ncompetent to not only stand trial but to waive it? At any rate, this was not a situation\nin which the trial judge specifically stated that Lawson \u201c \u2018evidenced no mental\ninstability,\u2019 \u201d Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298. Rather, the court\n\u201craised\u201d the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency for purposes of R.C. 2945.37(B).\n        {\u00b6 210} Nothing prohibits this court from reviewing the record and\ndetermining that the issue of competency was raised. Nothing prohibits us from\nremanding this case for a competency evaluation to be conducted and a competency\nhearing to be held; the result of that hearing would determine the course of events\nfrom that point. Such a hearing is required by statute, but one was not held. If we\ndo this, we would accomplish several important aims. We would acknowledge the\ngravity of any capital defendant\u2019s adverse-interest request to plead guilty to a\ncapital offense. We would also provide valuable guidance to this state\u2019s trial courts\nthat creating a sound record compliant with R.C. 2945.37(B) is required, especially\nwhen the defendant is making an adverse-interest decision, such as waiving a trial\nand pleading guilty to one or more capital offenses. Remanding this case for a\ncompetency hearing would be of benefit to the public in ensuring a high standard\nof compliance with due-process principles in cases in which a death sentence could\nbe imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 211} The issue of Lawson\u2019s competency was raised, requiring the trial\ncourt to hold a competency hearing. See Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016; R.C. 2945.37(B). We should require that this hearing be held.\n                 D. General problems with the current framework\n       {\u00b6 212} When a capital defendant seeks to abandon his or her rights and\nacquiesce in entering a guilty plea, essentially clearing the thorny thicket on the\npath toward execution by the state, we owe that defendant, the victims and their\nfamilies, the lower courts, and the public at large a standardized approach to ensure\nfairness and uniformity in trials of this gravamen. Viewing the record using the\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d method falls short, because it is based on\ngleaning information from a record when often no record was made.\n       {\u00b6 213} It is not acceptable to simply rely on the observations of the trial\ncourt and/or the experiences and opinions of defense counsel that a criminal\ndefendant is competent to stand trial.        The dissenting opinion in State v.\nMontgomery, relying on State v. Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 66, and United States v. Damon, 191 F.3d 561, 565 (4th Cir.1999),\nsquarely addressed this point:\n\n\n       The majority seems to be satisfied that [appellant, Caron\n       Montgomery,] stated in open court that he understood what he was\n       doing and that he signed a written waiver. This conclusion was\n       bolstered by the opinion of Montgomery\u2019s attorney\u2014who was not a\n       medical expert\u2014that Montgomery understood the rights that he was\n       waiving. But if medication prevented Montgomery from truly\n       comprehending his actions, how reliable were his spoken assurances\n       and his signed statement to the contrary? The trial court did not\n       inquire about whether or how the medications affected\n       Montgomery\u2019s abilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n               I believe that more was required under Mink and Damon. At\n       the very least, when someone is undoubtedly under the influence of\n       a prescription medication when making the decision to enter a guilty\n       plea, the trial court must inquire about the effects of the medication\n       so that it can ensure that the defendant understands the gravity of the\n       situation and comprehends his or her actions. This court should not\n       affirm a conviction, let alone a death sentence, by guessing about\n       the mental competence of a defendant. Further inquiry was required\n       before the trial court accepted Montgomery\u2019s plea of guilty.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71\nN.E.3d 180, \u00b6 196-197 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting). Most attorneys and judges are not\npracticing mental-health or disability experts. Relying on a defense attorney\u2019s\nopinion, when that opinion is likely to be a one-off (based on how defense counsel\ninterprets the defendant\u2019s behavior at that particular juncture of the trial),\nanecdotally based opinion on the defendant\u2019s competency is neither a sound legal\nnor ethical practice.   Judging a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity to reason and\nunderstand through observed behavior by defense counsel and/or the court,\nespecially when coupled with a grave, adverse-interest decision such as pleading\nguilty to one or more capital offenses, denies due process when the defendant is\ntaking prescription medication with clinical indications and side effects that\nresearch shows may affect sound reasoning at the time the defendant changes his\nor her plea. And, finally, there is an inherent and systemic flaw that may not even\nbe recognized when we perpetuate reliance on judges\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 subjective\nassessments of a capital defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or change a plea:\nperhaps we perpetuate predisposed ideas and stereotyped, culture- or race-based\nperceptions and predispositions about what is acceptable behavior during a trial.\nSee State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 62-\n\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n63 (giving deference to those who saw and heard the proceedings and stating that\nthe defendant \u201cdisplayed no outrageous, irrational behavior during trial\u201d). We can\ndo better than this. We are obligated to do better than this, especially in capital-\nmurder trials, when the ultimate penalty is death at the hands of the state.\n         {\u00b6 214} In the last 35 years, this court has rarely determined that a\ncompetency examination or hearing was warranted based on indicia in the record.3\nIn an opinion that might be considered an outlier, Were, 94 Ohio St.3d 173, 761\nN.E.2d 591, we remanded a death-penalty case for the trial court to conduct a\npretrial competency hearing. This result was based on defense counsel\u2019s repeated\nrequests for a competency hearing; on one defense attorney\u2019s opinion, based on his\nprior experience as a probate-court referee in civil-commitment hearings, that the\n\n\n3. In examining cases in which this court has considered the issue whether a competency\nexamination or hearing should have been conducted when a defendant made a request adverse to\nhis own interest, this court has overwhelmingly held that insufficient indicia of incompetency were\npresent. See, e.g., Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio 5487, 71 N.E.2d 180, at \u00b6 57-59\n(insufficient indicia of incompetency when defendant answered questions appropriately at plea\nhearing, defense counsel\u2019s assessment of competency was informed, and defendant displayed no\noutrageous, irrational, or confused behavior); State v.

Id. at 175-176.\nWe determined that this perfect storm of facts met the \u201csufficient indicia\u201d test: a\ndefense attorney who was adept at recognizing potential incompetency, a defendant\nwhose behavior rose to such a level that his counsel believed that he was not able\nto understand the proceedings against him, and the existence in the record of\nnumerous motions and requests for a competency assessment. Id. This court\u2019s\ndecision today permits and perpetuates a practice that a clinical evaluation of the\nmental competence of a defendant in a death-penalty case is not needed when a\ndefendant pleads guilty to the crime, even though there is ample evidence in the\nrecord of his mental illness. And we find today that no medical evaluation for\ncompetency is required when a defendant\u2019s experienced attorney\u2014by self-\nproclamation\u2014has adjudged his client to be competent based on counsel\u2019s stated\nability to recognize mental illness, even when that client may not outwardly\ndemonstrate visible symptoms of mental illness to nonclinical laypersons during\nthe limited time they interact with them.\n       {\u00b6 215} In short, the approach perpetuated in this case denies criminal\ndefendants accused of capital crimes the guarantee that the laws of this state will\nbe applied in a rigorously constitutional manner when the consequences may be\nirrevocable. We should not continue to rely on indicia in the record as sufficient to\ndetermine a defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty without requiring evidence\nbased on sound medical judgment. It is incumbent on this court to require in death-\npenalty cases what is now readily at our disposal\u2014the use of science in a\ncompetency evaluation so that the state puts to death only those whom we may\nfairly determine have knowingly and competently pleaded guilty. In doing this, we\nwould avoid what amounts to guessing who is competent based on \u201cindicia\u201d (that\nmay or may not make it into the record) in favor of science-based evidence that is\ninformed by evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n     E. The need for evidence-based practices and not just indicia in the record\n        {\u00b6 216} On February 21, 2019, when the trial court held a change-of-plea\nhearing for Lawson, the presiding judge asked defense counsel whether they had\nany concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency.\u201d\nLead defense counsel first informed the court that he was not \u201ca psychologist or a\npsychiatrist\u201d and was not in a position to \u201ctechnically answer\u201d that question.\nDefense counsel then informed the trial court that Dr. Bob Stinson had been\nconsulted on the issue and that the defense did not intend to raise the issue of\nLawson\u2019s competency. At this point in the proceedings, there was nothing in the\nrecord about Lawson\u2019s being suicidal, having attempted suicide in the past, having\nexperienced (or at the time experiencing) confusion and possible hallucinations, or\ntaking several medications. The fact that those indicia were not yet in the record at\nthis point does not negate their existence. It does, however, demonstrate the\ninherent flaws in this court\u2019s current \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d test.\n        {\u00b6 217} Defense counsel, the prosecutors, and the trial court entertained the\npossibility of having Dr. Stinson render an opinion on Lawson\u2019s competency. Dr.\nStinson had been hired as a mental- and behavioral-health expert for the mitigation\nphase of the trial. He was not hired to perform a competency examination for the\npurpose of trial. However, had the trial court been able to conduct at least a review\nof his written report at this juncture of the proceedings, the following would have\nbecome apparent:\n1.      Lawson was raised in a dysfunctional family, suffered from poverty,\n        emotional abuse, and probably physical abuse, and was exposed to familial\n        incest;\n2.      Lawson\u2019s family members had a history of mental illness, including bipolar\n        disorder, depression, and suicidal behavior, and had a history of alcoholism\n        and drug abuse; Lawson\u2019s mother was rated as being \u201csignificantly\n        functionally impaired\u201d by her physician;\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n3.     Lawson had mental-health problems starting at least by age 13, when he\n       was enrolled in anger-management classes; he was diagnosed with bipolar\n       disorder in 2011; he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on two\n       occasions following suicidal and homicidal episodes; he has been diagnosed\n       with depressive disorder and posttraumatic-stress disorder;\n4.     Since his psychiatric hospitalizations, he has been on a number of\n       medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressant medicines,\n       antipsychotic drugs, and a medication to help with sleep and to control\n       impulses;\n5.     After his arrest, Lawson was seen by staff members at Shawnee Mental\n       Health, where he disclosed that he had attempted to hang himself several\n       years before and reported that he had been having thoughts of suicide;\n6.     After his arrest, Lawson was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and\n       reported to Dr. Stinson that he was having trouble sleeping and\n       concentrating and was occasionally having auditory and visual\n       hallucinations.\n       {\u00b6 218} This information about Lawson was not discussed at all at this point\nin the proceedings even though it is discussed in this court\u2019s majority opinion. The\nArron Lawson identified and described in Dr. Stinson\u2019s report is a person impaired\nby mental illness who has a stated history of being suicidal. The trial court was not\npresented with this information until the mitigation phase of the proceeding, and\nthis is precisely an example of the problem with the test this court adopted in the\npast and once again applies in Lawson\u2019s case. Had the trial court simply ordered a\ncompetency examination, as was discussed at several junctures during the trial\nphase, the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency to stand trial would have been made clear\nin the record beyond the mere presence of vague indicia that the record now\ncontains.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 219} Putting someone to death for his or her crimes, even when the\ncrimes are heinous and when it is apparent that the person on trial is the person who\ncommitted the crimes, is always subject to the constitutional due-process principles\ncontained in the Bill of Rights, a document once demanded by, and its contents now\nguaranteed to, the people. Due-process principles are not satisfied by guessing or\nby the acknowledged inexactitude of gleaning indicia from a sketchy trial record.\nThe determination of Lawson\u2019s competency should be based on evidence. That the\nquestion of his competency was \u201craised\u201d was enough to require the trial court to\norder a competency evaluation and a hearing on the matter under R.C. 2945.37(B),\nno matter what his attorney said to the court. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 177, 95 S.Ct.\n896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (finding that even when a question of competency is inartfully\nraised \u201cit would have been, at the very least, the better practice to order an\nimmediate examination\u201d).\n          {\u00b6 220} No longer should this court rely on the mere scaffolding of\ntradition, intuition, and prior case authority for determining a matter that is the\nsubject of scientifically supportable evidence, especially when a statute (R.C.\n2945.37(B)) requires otherwise.       The benefits of requiring evidenced-based\npractices when determining a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial are similar to\nthe benefits that are detailed in clinical literature for programs involving everything\nfrom medicine and nursing, to education, to mental-health and substance-abuse\nservices, to psychiatry, to the imposing of criminal-justice sanctions and more. See,\ne.g., Social Programs that Work, http://www.evidencebasedprograms.org\n(accessed July 9, 2021) [https://perma.cc/T76K-9KFZ].

This governmental center \u201cprovides communities,\nclinicians, policy-makers and others with the information and tools to incorporate\nevidence-based practices into their communities or clinical settings.\u201d Id. The\ncenter\u2019s website contains a plethora of publications on both substance abuse and\nmental illness, including co-occurring disorders, for both youths and adults. This\ncourt should be requiring that evidence-based practices be the standard for\ncompetency evidence used by the courts of this state for what are essentially clinical\nconclusions regarding defendants\u2019 competency to stand trial. Once we do this, we\nwill have taken a giant stride to ensure that due-process principles are adhered to in\nthe prosecutions of persons accused of crimes, especially those accused of\ncommitting capital crimes.\n     F. Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest request\n       {\u00b6 221} When reading the fact pattern of violence and often torture that\noccurs in nearly every death-penalty case, the reader is left to conjecture: Who in\ntheir right mind could do such a thing? Since that perception is present from the\nbeginning, and since an adverse-interest request such as agreeing to plead guilty to\na capital offense as charged could be viewed as irrational and against the\ndefendant\u2019s self-interests, it would be best for courts to start from a presumption\nthat competency is at issue whenever a defendant makes an adverse-interest\nrequest. Starting with this presumption and questioning competency in this way\nwould mean that a trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2945.37(B) would be ensured.\nThe trial court would then be required to conduct further inquiry, thus creating a\nrecord and instilling a more reliable, constitutional approach.\n       {\u00b6 222} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest alleviates the necessity for a court to inquire as to defense counsel\u2019s position\non the subject. The judiciary must dismiss the temptation to put defense attorneys\nin the position of assessing their clients\u2019 capabilities, which goes beyond the\nattorneys\u2019 expertise and their ethical duties. We also should steer courts away from\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nlooking for subjectively bizarre behavior and encourage them to simply obtain\ninformation from a clinical expert using evidence-based practices.\n       {\u00b6 223} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest also triggers the building of a record. A competency examination and a\nhearing would be the most comprehensive way to ensure a complete and thorough\nrecord. The trial court should make a finding one way or the other based on\nevidence in the record regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand\nchoices and assist in his or her own defense. This includes determining whether\nthe defendant possesses the ability to comprehend the ramifications of his or her\ndecision, including understanding that the choice may lead to death, determining\nwhether the defendant is able to make such a decision knowingly and intelligently,\nnot unduly affected by conditions of mental health, physical health, or\nimprisonment, and determining whether the defendant possesses the ability to\nreason logically and fully understands the ramifications of his decision. Berry, 80\nOhio St.3d at 371, 374-376, 686 N.E.2d 1097.\n       {\u00b6 224} For example, in State v. Mink, in which the defendant was charged\nwith aggravated murder for the horrendous stabbings and beatings of his parents,\nthe trial court sua sponte appointed two psychologists to conduct separate\ncompetency examinations when Mink first informed the court that he wished to\nenter pleas of guilty to all counts, to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand to represent himself. 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064,\nat \u00b6 31, 59-60. The trial court then made an initial determination based on the\nreports of those psychologists that Mink was competent to stand trial and accepted\nhis guilty pleas and later made a separate determination that Mink was competent\nto waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, after which it sentenced him to\ndeath. Id. at \u00b6 22-26, 60. This court affirmed Mink\u2019s death sentence and he was\neventually executed as he had requested, see id. at \u00b6 26, but because the trial court\nhad insisted on and had conducted a thorough, evidence-based process, we were\n\n\n\n\n                                         71\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nnot left to doubt the constitutionality of Mink\u2019s death sentence with regard to his\ncompetency. We noted that the trial court had gone \u201cto great lengths\u201d before\nfinding him competent, id. at \u00b6 59, and that the court had \u201cfully protected Mink\u2019s\nconstitutional rights in determining his competency,\u201d id. at \u00b6 61.\n        {\u00b6 225} Perhaps not every decision a defendant in a capital case makes that\nis against his or her interest should trigger a competency evaluation, but it would\nbehoove courts to proceed thoughtfully and cautiously. For example, a clinical\nexamination might not be required when a defendant wishes to waive representation\nby counsel. When making a decision like that, the defendant still has procedural\nand substantive protections in place. Courts should seek to examine a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency in view of the context and purpose of the proceeding. Therefore,\ncompetency evaluations should be specifically tailored to address the capacity and\nthe ability of the defendant to understand the ramifications of the specific adverse-\ninterest request he or she is making. See Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 150, 150-\n151, 86 S.Ct. 1320, 16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966).4\n\n4. See also the trial court\u2019s \u201cDecision and Entry Finding the Defendant Competent to Waive the\nPresentation of Mitigating Evidence,\u201d in State v. Mink, Montgomery C.P. No. 2000-CR-2900 (June\n28, 2001):\n\n                 Applying the criteria set forth in State v. Ashworth (1999), 85 Ohio St.3d\n        56, [706 N.E.2d 1231,] and Based upon the Court\u2019s inquiry of the Defendant\n        conducted in open court and the competency reports of Dr. Thomas O. Martin and\n        Dr. Kim Stookey, the Court finds that the Defendant:\n                 1.) Understands the choice between life and death,\n                 2.) Has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to\n                 pursue the presentation of evidence,\n                 3.) Fully understands the ramifications of his decision,\n                 4.) Possesses the ability to reason logically, i.e. to choose means that\n                 relate logically to his ends,\n                 5.) Understands his right to present mitigating evidence,\n                 6.) Understands the meaning of mitigating evidence,\n                 7.) Understands the importance of mitigating evidence,\n                 8.) Understands the use of mitigating evidence to offset the aggravating\n                 circumstances and,\n                 9.) Understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence.\n                 The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n        presentation of mitigating evidence is made knowingly, intelligently and\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 226} Additionally, requiring that a record be developed when a\ndefendant invokes an adverse-interest request ensures balance in the system. If\nLawson had been asked further questions, his suicidal ideation and suicide attempt\nmay have become known to the court, as counsel presumably were aware of those\nmatters. At that point, any court would certainly have sought further information\nabout the defendant\u2019s mental health and capabilities before allowing the trial to\nproceed for the state to seek his execution. See Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d at 64, 706\nN.E.2d 1231 (noting the state\u2019s interest \u201cin not allowing the death penalty statute\nto be used as a means of state-assisted suicide\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 227} Because we must ensure rigorous compliance with constitutional\nstandards in capital cases, I cannot concur in affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentences\nunder our current framework of analysis.\n       II. The Validity of Lawson\u2019s Jury-Trial Waiver and Guilty Pleas\n       {\u00b6 228} Insofar as Lawson\u2019s claims that his waiver of a jury trial and pleas\nof guilty were not done knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, for the same\nreasons articulated above that the court should have ordered a competency\nexamination, I cannot concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record supports\nthat Lawson\u2019s pleas were fairly entered, underpinned by an adequate ability to\nreason and understand the proceedings against him.\n       {\u00b6 229} In accepting the waiver and pleas, even if the trial court had\ncomplied with State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 423 N.E.2d 115 (1981),\nparagraph one of the syllabus, and with Crim.R. 11, and even if the trial court had\nsufficiently inquired about Lawson\u2019s use of medications, Lawson was never asked\nwhy he wanted to enter the guilty pleas; his answer to that question may have\nclarified his lack of perceived or real duress, delusion, misunderstanding, or\nsuicidal motivation.\n\n       voluntarily. The Court therefore accepts the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n       presentation of mitigating evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 230} For these reasons, this court should be encouraging trial courts to\nthoroughly and appropriately examine a defendant\u2019s competency and state of mind\nwhen the defendant makes an adverse-interest request\u2014such as pleading guilty to\none or more capital offenses\u2014rather than tolerating trial courts\u2019 failures to comply\nwith R.C. 2945.37(B).\n                                  III. Conclusion\n       {\u00b6 231} Because this court should not endorse a death sentence when the\nconstitutionality of a defendant\u2019s convictions remains in doubt, I respectfully\ndissent from the majority\u2019s judgment. I would reverse Lawson\u2019s convictions and\nthe sentences of death. I would further remand this case for the trial court to order\na competency examination that it contemplated ordering before it accepted\nLawson\u2019s guilty pleas and to hold a hearing based on the findings and\nrecommendations contained in that evaluation, in accord with what I believe this\ncourt\u2019s holding should be, as expressed in this dissenting opinion.\n                               _________________\n       Brigham M.

Lawson, murdered four\npeople: Stacey Holston, her eight-year-old son D.H., her mother, Tammie McGuire,\nand her mother\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire. On October 13, Lawson surrendered\nto police and confessed to the murders.\n        {\u00b6 3} The Lawrence County grand jury returned an 11-count indictment,\nincluding four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications.\nLawson entered guilty pleas to all counts and specifications of the indictment.\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.06, a three-judge panel of the common pleas court heard the\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nstate\u2019s evidence of guilt with regard to the capital charges. The panel found Lawson\nguilty of four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications as to\neach count. The panel then conducted a sentencing hearing and sentenced Lawson\nto death for each aggravated murder.\n       {\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Lawson raises five propositions of law. We overrule\neach of the propositions of law. After conducting an independent review, we\nconclude that although significant mitigating factors exist, the aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\nof the four aggravated murders. We further conclude that each death sentence is\nappropriate and proportionate. Therefore, we affirm all four death sentences.\n                 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                     A. Facts\n       {\u00b6 5} Arron Lawson was Stacey Holston\u2019s first cousin. Stacey lived with\nher husband, Todd Holston, and their sons, D.H. and two-year-old B.H., near Pedro,\nOhio. Lawson lived nearby and was in the habit of visiting the Holstons daily.\n       {\u00b6 6} Lawson was infatuated with Stacey; he told his mother that she was\n\u201cthe love of his life.\u201d In his confession, he stated that he and Stacey had been\nhaving a sexual affair, which Stacey had broken off \u201c[a]bout a week ago,\u201d i.e.,\napproximately October 6, 2017.\n       {\u00b6 7} Lawson visited Stacey on Tuesday, October 10, 2017, the day before\nthe murders, while Todd was at work. During this visit, Lawson surreptitiously\nentered a bedroom at the back of the house, opened a window, and inserted a book\nbetween the window and the sill to hold the window partly open. By his own later\nadmission, he did this with the intention of entering the house the next day to\ncommit murder.\n       {\u00b6 8} At about 7:15 p.m., when Todd came home, Lawson was still there\nwith Stacey and the children. At Stacey\u2019s request, Todd drove Lawson home. Todd\ntestified at trial that Lawson \u201cwasn\u2019t too happy about\u201d being sent home.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The next morning, Todd left for work at approximately 4:30 a.m.\nAbout half an hour later, Lawson entered the Holstons\u2019 residence through the rear\nwindow. He had a 20-gauge shotgun, eight shells loaded with slugs, and a backpack\ncontaining flashlights, toilet paper, knives, a tarp, and other items. Lawson hid in\nthe back bedroom until about 8:30 a.m.\n       {\u00b6 10} Meanwhile, D.H.\u2019s school bus arrived and D.H. left the house to go\nto school. Stacey sent with him a note directing the school to put D.H. on a different\nbus that afternoon than he normally rode and to take him to his grandparents\u2019 house.\n       {\u00b6 11} By 8:30, after D.H. had left, Stacey was in the home with B.H.\nStacey entered the back bedroom where Lawson was hiding, and Lawson shot her\nthree times in the chest and shoulder. She fell to the floor.\n       {\u00b6 12} Lawson dragged her body to D.H.\u2019s bedroom where he lifted her\nonto a futon bed and, using a condom, had sex with her corpse. Lawson discarded\nthe condom in the kitchen wastebasket. He then returned to the bedroom and\ncovered Stacey\u2019s body with a blanket and the futon\u2019s mattress.\n       {\u00b6 13} As these events were occurring, Todd was at a worksite in Maysville,\nKentucky, where he clocked in at 6:43 a.m. It was Stacey\u2019s habit to send Todd a\ntext message early every morning to make sure he had arrived safely at work. When\nshe failed to do so on October 11, Todd began to worry. He repeatedly tried to call\nand text her throughout the day, but she did not respond.\n       {\u00b6 14} At 9:23 a.m., Lawson used Stacey\u2019s cell phone to call D.H.\u2019s school.\nPosing as Todd, Lawson told the school\u2019s guidance secretary that D.H.\u2019s\ngrandfather was unable to watch D.H. that day, so D.H. should be taken home on\nhis usual bus that afternoon. Lawson spoke calmly and gave the guidance secretary\nno reason to doubt he was who he claimed to be. Because Lawson was using\nStacey\u2019s phone, the phone number on the school\u2019s caller ID matched the number\non file in the office. So the original arrangement was canceled and D.H. was\nbrought home after school. Meanwhile, Lawson waited at the Holstons\u2019 residence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nHe fed B.H., changed his diaper, and later put him down for a nap in the main\nbedroom.\n        {\u00b6 15} When D.H. arrived home, Lawson sat with him in the living room\nand they talked about school. However, D.H. began asking Lawson where his\nmother was and when his father was coming home. Lacking answers, Lawson told\nD.H. that Lawson\u2019s PlayStation 3 was in D.H.\u2019s room behind the dresser. D.H.\nwent to his bedroom. As D.H. looked behind his dresser, Lawson shot him twice,\nonce in the arm and once in the torso. Lawson left the boy\u2019s body where it fell and\ncovered it with clothes. After killing D.H., Lawson continued to wait in the\nHolstons\u2019 residence.\n        {\u00b6 16} Around 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., Todd tried again to contact Stacey on his\nway home from his worksite. He then called Stacey\u2019s mother, Tammie McGuire,\nwho lived about a quarter mile from the Holstons. Tammie agreed to check on\nStacey and drove to the house. A few minutes later, she called Todd back and told\nhim that she was at his house but that the door was locked. Todd authorized her to\nbreak in, and she did. The phone connection remained open. A few minutes later,\nTodd heard Tammie scream, \u201cOh, my God\u201d followed by a loud noise. Then, as\nTodd later testified, \u201call of a sudden it was just quiet.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 17} By Lawson\u2019s account, he was in the main bedroom when he heard\nTammie forcing her way into the house. He hid behind the bedroom door; when\nTammie opened that door, he stepped out and shot her. Lawson dragged Tammie\u2019s\nbody to the laundry area and threw a blanket over her. He then used her keys to\nmove her truck behind the house.\n        {\u00b6 18} Meanwhile, Todd phoned Tammie\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire, and\napprised him of the situation. Donald said he would go and check, and he walked\nto the house.\n        {\u00b6 19} According to Lawson, Donald initially tried to enter through the\nback door, but it was locked, so Donald went around to the locked front door and\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u201crammed through.\u201d When Donald came in, Lawson shot him and dragged the body\nto D.H.\u2019s bedroom.\n        {\u00b6 20} About 10 to 20 minutes later, Todd arrived home. When he came\nthrough the front door, Lawson attacked him with a knife, stabbing him a number\nof times in the head, neck, and torso. Todd wrested the knife from Lawson and\npinned him to the couch.\n        {\u00b6 21} Todd asked Lawson why he had attacked him.            According to\nLawson, he then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a blind thing of anger.\u201d But\nTodd testified that Lawson had said, \u201cThere\u2019s been people breaking in out here, and\nI thought you was one of them.\u201d According to Todd, Lawson then \u201cshook like he\nsnapped out of something.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 22} Todd also asked Lawson where Stacey and the children were.\nLawson said they were in the bedroom and were \u201cokay.\u201d Todd testified that he\nthen forcefully removed Lawson from the house. Lawson drove away in the truck\nbelonging to the McGuires.\n        {\u00b6 23} Todd checked on B.H., who was unharmed. (According to Lawson,\nB.H. slept through at least the first three murders.) Todd then looked through the\nhouse. After finding the bodies of Tammie, Stacey, and Donald, he took B.H. and\ndrove to the McGuires\u2019 house, where he borrowed a cell phone from Tammie\u2019s\nbrother and called 9-1-1.\n        {\u00b6 24} Lawson had planned to hide out in the woods, but he had left his\nbackpack and shotgun behind in the Holstons\u2019 house, so he drove to a store. With\ncash stolen from the Holstons, he bought new clothes to replace his bloodstained\nones.\n        {\u00b6 25} While driving the truck, Lawson was pursued by police; he\nabandoned the truck and fled on foot. Eventually, he reached a wooded area, where\nhe spent the next two nights. Lawson later said that after one \u201ccold, cold night\u201d in\nthe woods, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have no more flight in me.\u201d Nevertheless, he did not\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemerge from the woods until the morning of October 13, when he was apprehended.\nDetectives took him to the county prosecutor\u2019s office in Ironton, where he\nconfessed to the four murders.\n       {\u00b6 26} Dr. Robert Shott, the deputy Montgomery County coroner,\nperformed autopsies on all four victims. He testified that Stacey suffered two\nshotgun wounds to the chest and one to the back, fatally injuring her heart and\nlungs. D.H. was shot twice, receiving fatal wounds to the heart, lung, and aorta.\nTammie was shot once in the neck, fatally injuring her spinal cord, and once in the\nshoulder. Donald was shot once in the shoulder and once, fatally, in the chest.\n                              B. Procedural History\n       {\u00b6 27} On October 18, 2017, the grand jury indicted Lawson on four counts\nof aggravated murder with death specifications. Count 1 charged the aggravated\nmurder of Stacey Holston with prior calculation and design, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A).      Count 1 carried three death specifications: course of conduct\ninvolving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(5); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7),\npredicated on rape.\n       {\u00b6 28} Count 2 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of D.H., a child\nunder the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(C). This count carried six death\nspecifications: course of conduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder of a\nvictim younger than 13, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9); murder to escape\ndetection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated\non kidnapping; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Count 3 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Tammie\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Count 4 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Donald\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Counts 3 and 4 both carried four death specifications: a course of\nconduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n       {\u00b6 30} The indictment also included the following noncapital counts: Count\n5, attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.02(A); Count 6,\nfelonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Count 7, aggravated burglary,\nin violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2); Count 8, rape, in violation of R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2); Count 9, abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B); Count\n10, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Count 11, tampering with\nevidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1); Count 12, theft of a motor vehicle, in\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(5); and Count 13, failure to comply with\na police officer\u2019s order, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii). Counts\n1 through 4 and Counts 7, 8, and 10 carried firearm specifications.\n       {\u00b6 31} On February 21, 2019, the state voluntarily dismissed the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8) specifications that were attached to Counts 2, 3, and 4. Lawson then\nentered pleas of guilty to all remaining counts and specifications before the three-\njudge panel. Over the next few days, the three-judge panel heard witness testimony\nas required by R.C. 2945.06 and on February 25, 2019, unanimously found Lawson\nguilty of all counts of the indictment except Count 8 (rape) and of all specifications\nexcept the specification for felony murder predicated on rape that was attached to\nCount 1 (aggravated murder of Stacey).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The panel then held a mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C.\n2929.03(D)(1) beginning on February 26, 2019. After hearing the evidence that\nLawson offered in mitigation, the panel sentenced him to death on all four counts\nof aggravated murder. He also received sentences totaling 59 years and six months\non the noncapital counts and specifications. Lawson appeals of right and we now\naddress his propositions of law.\n      II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY\n                                     HEARING\n       {\u00b6 33} Lawson initially pleaded not guilty to the indictment. More than a\nyear later, he changed his mind, waived a jury trial, and entered guilty pleas to each\ncount of the indictment and to all the death specifications (except the three that the\nstate voluntarily dismissed). In so doing, he acted against his trial counsel\u2019s advice.\n       {\u00b6 34} Defense counsel never requested a hearing into Lawson\u2019s\ncompetence to stand trial. Nevertheless, in his first proposition of law, Lawson\ncontends that the trial court had a constitutional duty to inquire into his competence\nto stand trial before accepting his change of plea.\n                                 A. Relevant Facts\n       {\u00b6 35} On February 11, 2019, several days into the jury-selection process,\ndefense counsel informed the trial court that Lawson did not want a trial. In\nchambers, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys explained that Lawson did not want to put\nhimself, his family, and the families of the victims through a full trial \u201cwith all of\nthe gruesome photos that would be presented [and] all of the things that would be\n* * * said about him.\u201d Counsel said that he had explained to Lawson that if he\nentered a guilty plea, the case would proceed before a three-judge panel, not a jury.\n       {\u00b6 36} Defense counsel then observed:\n\n\n       I suppose * * * if he wants to do that, there\u2019s always a question of\n       whether or not there needs to be an examination of his competence\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        to waive jury in a capital case. Obviously that\u2019s not something that\n        we can [determine] today. And it may be something that would\n        require a psychological evaluation, although in a capital case, I\n        would ask for an independent one rather than what we would do in\n        a typical case.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 37} One of the prosecutors noted that the defense team included a\npsychologist, Dr. Bob Stinson, and asked whether Dr. Stinson could render an\nopinion on Lawson\u2019s competence. Defense counsel replied that he could not\n\u201ccommit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that,\u201d because a competency assessment is\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d from a mitigation assessment.        Nevertheless, defense\ncounsel noted that Dr. Stinson \u201c[o]bviously * * * would have more familiarity with\n[Lawson] than anyone else\u201d and stated that he \u201cassume[d] that it could be done in\na manner\u201d; he also stated that he had not \u201cthought through whether that would\ncreate some sort of a conflict in terms of what [Dr. Stinson\u2019s] testimony would be\nin the mitigation phase.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 38} The trial judge then stated that he had \u201cbrought this up months ago\non the potential for a competency evaluation\u201d but that he had declined to order one\nbecause the defense had opposed it. (Any previous discussions of competency\nissues must have occurred off the record, as the transcript does not reflect any\ndiscussion of a competency evaluation before February 11.) The trial judge\ncontinued, \u201cI\u2019m now second-guessing myself that I should have [ordered] it over\nobjection.\u201d       Defense counsel remarked that the court was \u201cnot incorrect\u201d in\ndeclining to order an evaluation over the defense\u2019s opposition. The prosecutor\npointed out that the defense had not raised a question about Lawson\u2019s competence\nto stand trial.\n        {\u00b6 39} At the request of defense counsel, the court took a recess so that\nLawson could discuss the matter with his family. When the session resumed,\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefense counsel told the court at a bench conference that \u201cafter much thought,\nconsideration, [and] discussion with family members and counsel,\u201d Lawson had\ndecided not to change his plea and would proceed with a jury trial. The court then\nresumed the jury-selection process and the prospective jurors were brought into the\ncourtroom.\n       {\u00b6 40} The next day, however, Lawson\u2019s counsel informed the trial court\nthat Lawson had decided to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea\nto a three-judge panel. The trial court questioned Lawson at length about whether\nhe understood that he was waiving his constitutional right to have a jury hear and\ndecide the case. Lawson affirmatively stated a number of times that he understood\nthe consequences of his decision.\n       {\u00b6 41} During this exchange, the trial court asked Lawson whether he had\nconsulted with his family about his decision.          Lawson answered that after\nconsulting with his family the previous day, he \u201chad a second thought throughout\nthe night.\u201d He informed the trial court that \u201cit was a little rough because I saw my\nmom crying and it always plays on my heart. And then after a while I have to make\na better decision for my life and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 42} The trial court accepted Lawson\u2019s waiver. Lawson\u2019s counsel then\nfiled a written waiver of jury trial that Lawson had signed. Defense counsel\ncertified in writing that they had consulted with Lawson, had explained his right to\na jury trial, and believed that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\nThe trial court\u2019s acceptance of Lawson\u2019s jury waiver was also filed; it included the\ntrial court\u2019s finding that the waiver was made \u201cknowingly, intelligently and\nvoluntarily.\u201d On February 19, 2019, the chief justice of this court assigned two\nadditional judges to serve on the three-judge panel.\n       {\u00b6 43} On February 21, 2019, the panel held a change-of-plea hearing. At\nthe hearing, defense counsel stated that they had discussed the change of plea with\nLawson for about 90 minutes that day. Prior to proceeding to consider the change\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nof plea, the presiding judge asked counsel whether at any point they ever had any\nconcerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency * * * that\nwould have prevented him from knowingly and intelligently and voluntarily\nentering into th[e] plea waiver\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that based on\nhis many years of experience with representing incompetent clients, his interactions\nwith Lawson gave him \u201cno reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of\nthose categories.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 44} The presiding judge then asked whether defense counsel had\n\u201cconducted appropriate investigation * * * into * * * mental issues or competency\nissues.\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that with Dr. Stinson\u2019s assistance, they\nhad conducted such an investigation. After lengthy discussions with Dr. Stinson,\nthe attorney said, the defense had elected not to raise the issue of \u201cpossible\nincompetency to proceed in this matter.\u201d\n            B. The Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire Into Competence\n  1. Historical perspective on the prohibition against the trial of incompetent\n                                     defendants\n       {\u00b6 45} The fundamental principle that a criminal defendant who has been\nadjudicated to be legally incompetent shall not be required to stand trial has deep\nroots in common law. See Freeman v. People, 4 Denio 9, 1847 WL 4116, *19\n(N.Y.1847) (recognizing that new competency legislation \u201cwas not introductory\u201d\nas it was \u201cin strict conformity with the common law on the subject\u201d). The\nprohibition against the trial of incompetent defendants \u201cdates back at least to the\ntime of [Sir William] Blackstone.\u201d Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct.\n2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), fn. 11. In the eighteenth century, Blackstone wrote\nthat if a man commits an offense and becomes \u201cmad\u201d after the commission of the\noffense, then he should not be arraigned for it \u201cbecause he is not able to plead to it\nwith that advice and caution that he ought.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\non the Laws of England, 24. Similarly, if he becomes \u201cmad\u201d after pleading, he\nshould not be tried, \u201cfor how can he make his defense?\u201d Id.\n       {\u00b6 46} The Supreme Court has long held that convicting a defendant while\nhe is legally incompetent violates the United States Constitution. \u201c[T]he conviction\nof an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process, and * * *\nstate procedures must be adequate to protect this right.\u201d Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S.\n375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), citing Bishop v. United States, 350\nU.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835 (1956).\n       {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2945.37, which was first enacted in 1978, see Am.Sub.H.B. No.\n565, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2937, 2943-2946, sets forth the process that a\ndefendant is due when an issue is raised pertaining to his competency. R.C.\n2945.37(B) states:\n\n\n               In a criminal action * * *, the court, prosecutor, or defense\n       may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. If\n       the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\n       hold a hearing on the issue * * *. If the issue is raised after the trial\n       has commenced, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for\n       good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion.\n\n\n               2. What Triggers a Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire?\n       {\u00b6 48} A defendant is rebuttably presumed to be competent to stand trial.\nState v. Barton, 108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 56, citing\nR.C. 2945.37(G). \u201c[A] competency determination is necessary only when a court\nhas reason to doubt the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 401, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, fn. 13.\n       {\u00b6 49} Over 60 years ago, the now well-known test for determining legal\ncompetency to stand trial was announced in Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402,\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960).           Agreeing with the solicitor general\u2019s\nargument, the Supreme Court explained that a trial court must inquire into whether\nthe defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a\nreasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well\nas factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Id. at 402. This standard\nalso applies when a court is determining a defendant\u2019s competency to plead guilty\nor waive his right to counsel. Godinez at 396, 398-399.\n       {\u00b6 50} We first recognized the Dusky competency test in State v. Chapin,\n67 Ohio St.2d 437, 439-440, 424 N.E.2d 317 (1981), and have continued to apply\nit in the ensuing decades, see State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-\n5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 56 (stating that the Dusky test applies when assessing a\ndefendant\u2019s competency to enter a guilty plea).\n       {\u00b6 51} Due process requires a court to hold a hearing when it has been\npresented with a \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence.\u201d Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S.\n162, 175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). When the issue of competency is\nraised after a defendant\u2019s trial has commenced, R.C. 2945.37(B) directs that \u201cthe\ncourt shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s\nown motion.\u201d We have construed the connotation of the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d to be\n\u201cin accordance with the general principles set forth [by the Supreme Court] in\nDrope and Pate[,383 U.S. at 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815].\u201d State v. Berry,\n72 Ohio St.3d 354, 360, 650 N.E.2d 433 (1995), citing Chapin. Therefore, \u201c[t]he\nright to a hearing on the issue of competency rises to the level of a constitutional\nguarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence\u2019 such that\nan inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s\nright to a fair trial.\u201d Berry at 359, quoting Drope at 175.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                     3. Analysis\n      a. Were there sufficient indicia of incompetence to require a hearing?\n       {\u00b6 52} Lawson acknowledges that his counsel never asked for a\ncompetency evaluation, but he contends that the trial court denied him due process\nby not ordering one sua sponte. He contends that the record in this case establishes\nsufficient \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d to require a hearing.\n       {\u00b6 53} Three facts, Lawson contends, called his competence into question.\nFirst, his decision to waive a jury trial and plead guilty to the indictment was made\nagainst the advice of his counsel. Second, he displayed \u201cindecision,\u201d in that he\nchanged his mind about pleading guilty. Third, at the time of his plea, he \u201cwas\nbeing treated with psychiatric medications,\u201d a fact he disclosed to the trial court\nduring the plea colloquy.\n       {\u00b6 54} Lawson\u2019s acting against the advice of counsel does not indicate\nincompetence. We have noted that a defendant\u2019s \u201crefusal to heed his counsel\u2019s\nadvice * * * [does] not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the\ncharges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in\nhis defense.\u201d State v. Johnson, 112 Ohio St.3d 210, 858 N.E.2d 1144, 2006-Ohio-\n6404, \u00b6 161. Indeed, such a refusal generally \u201cevidences [the defendant\u2019s] ability\nto participate in his defense.\u201d State v. Fletcher 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 49814, 1985\nWL 4215, *2 (Dec. 5, 1985).\n       {\u00b6 55} Nor does Lawson\u2019s alleged indecision suggest that he was\nincompetent. The record shows that after first expressing his desire to plead guilty\non February 11, 2019, Lawson discussed the matter with his counsel and family\nand then decided not to change his plea. The next day, however, he filed his written\njury waiver. The record does not show that he changed his mind again. On\nFebruary 21, he still wished to plead guilty, and he did so without further hesitation.\n       {\u00b6 56} It is not surprising that a defendant contemplating entering a guilty\nplea in a capital case would display some hesitation. \u201cIndecisiveness is not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsame as incompetency[,] however.\u201d Johnson v. State, 138 Md.App. 539, 567, 772\nA.2d 1260 (2001). And Lawson\u2019s indecision does not amount to irrationality. See\nUnited States v. Miller, 531 F.3d 340, 348 (6th Cir.2008) (in determining\ncompetency, a court is to consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior).\nLawson explained that he changed his mind due to the emotional toll he felt when,\nduring a visit, his mom cried to him about his actions. However, once he distanced\nhimself from those emotions and further reflected, he knew that the best decision\nfor him was to change his not-guilty plea to a plea of guilty.\n       {\u00b6 57} In any event, Lawson\u2019s change of mind was brief. Having decided\nto plead guilty on February 12, he held to his decision in the face of his counsel\u2019s\ncontrary advice and after a rigorous plea colloquy. And he continued to hold to his\ndecision over the ensuing nine days and during the change-of-plea hearing before\nthe three-judge panel. This sequence of events has no tendency to show that\nLawson lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding, nor does it suggest that he was unable to understand the\nproceedings.\n       {\u00b6 58} Finally, Lawson cites his statement during the plea colloquy that he\nwas taking prescription medication. The presiding judge asked Lawson whether he\nwas \u201cpresently under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or mind-altering\nsubstance.\u201d Lawson replied: \u201cI\u2019m under prescription medication, but that is all.\u201d\nHe stated that he was taking naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and Zoloft.\n       {\u00b6 59} However, \u201cit is a matter of statutory and decisional law that \u2018[t]he\nfact that a defendant is taking antidepressant medication or prescribed psychotropic\ndrugs does not negate his competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio\nSt.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 56, quoting State v. Ketterer, 111\nOhio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 71; see also State v. Mink, 101\nOhio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 38; R.C. 2945.37(F) (\u201cThe\ncourt shall not find a defendant incompetent to stand trial solely * * * because the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant is receiving or has received psychotropic drugs or other medication, even\nif the defendant might become incompetent to stand trial without the drugs or\nmedication\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 60} In both Mink and Ketterer, as Lawson points out, \u201ccompetency\nevaluations were conducted * * * before each defendant entered his guilty plea to\ncapital charges.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 54, citing Mink at \u00b6 31-32 and Ketterer at \u00b6 67.\nNevertheless, Mink and Ketterer do not stand for the proposition \u201cthat a court must\norder a competency hearing before accepting a guilty plea from a capital defendant\nwho is taking a prescription medication for mental illness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)\nMontgomery at \u00b6 54. And in Montgomery, we expressly declined to so hold. Id.\n       {\u00b6 61} Lawson stated during the colloquy that his medications did not\nprevent him from understanding what his attorneys or the court said to him, nor did\nthey affect his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court\nalso asked Lawson if there was any medication that he had been prescribed but was\nnot taking; he said no. Moreover, during the plea colloquy, Lawson \u201cappropriately\nanswered the court\u2019s questions,\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 57, and displayed no\n\u201coutrageous, irrational or confused\u201d behavior, id. at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 62} The presiding judge asked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen\nany indication that Lawson\u2019s medications \u201ccould be affecting his ability to reason\nor [his] judgment.\u201d Both attorneys replied in the negative. \u201cSolemn declarations\nin open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S.\n63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Lawson\u2019s counsel knew that Lawson\nwas taking medication, \u201cyet they had no concerns about his competence.\u201d\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 51. The\nrecord contains no countervailing evidence\u2014nothing to suggest that the\nmedications Lawson was taking could have hampered his ability to understand the\nproceedings or assist his counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 63} Finally, after Lawson informed the court that he was taking\nprescription medication, the trial court conducted a full plea colloquy under\nCrim.R. 11. The panel asked Lawson whether he understood the constitutional\nrights he was waiving by pleading guilty, the consequences of his pleading guilty,\nand the maximum sentence he could potentially receive if found guilty of the capital\nspecifications. The panel had previously verified that he understood the written\nplea of guilty and had executed it with the assistance of his counsel. The panel\nasked Lawson whether he understood each of the charges against him. Lawson\n\u201canswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent\nfashion.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 50.\n       {\u00b6 64} Trial counsel\u2019s statements to the trial court are also important in\nconsidering whether the trial court violated Lawson\u2019s due-process rights by failing\nto initiate a competency hearing. \u201cTrial counsel\u2019s assurances to the court are\nrelevant because \u2018a defendant\u2019s counsel is in the best position to evaluate a client\u2019s\ncomprehension of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Stanley v. Cullen, 633 F.3d 852, 861 (9th\nCir.2011), quoting Hernandez v. Ylst, 930 F.2d 714, 718 (9th Cir.1991). The\nSupreme Court has recognized that \u201cjudges must depend to some extent on counsel\nto bring issues into focus.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 176-77, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103. Lawson\u2019s defense counsel never asserted their belief that Lawson was\nincompetent. In fact, lead defense counsel stated just the opposite.         Counsel\nindicated that the trial court was correct in declining to order a competency\nevaluation. He told the court that he had spent \u201cmany hours\u201d with Lawson over a\n17-month period and had discussed Lawson\u2019s competence with Dr. Stinson, and\nlead defense counsel expressly stated that he had \u201cno reason to think\u201d that Lawson\nwas incompetent to enter a guilty plea. \u201c[W]hen a trial court must decide whether\nto hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, reviewing courts\n\u2018give weight * * * to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the defendant.\u2019 \u201d State\nv. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298 (1999), quoting Commonwealth\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nv. Hall, 15 Mass.App. 1, 3, 443 N.E.2d 121 (1982). In this case, the presiding judge\nhad observed Lawson\u2019s in-court demeanor for months and was able to observe his\ndemeanor during the plea colloquy. Indeed, \u201cit is noteworthy that nobody on the\nspot thought [Lawson\u2019s] behavior raised any question as to his competence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Cowans at 84; accord State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-\nOhio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 63; Montgomery at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 65} Under all the circumstances here, the facts that Lawson cites as\nindicia of incompetence were insufficient to overcome the general presumption of\ncompetence and were insufficient to entitle him to a competency evaluation.\n               b. Did the trial court raise the issue of competency?\n       {\u00b6 66} Lawson contends that \u201cthe [trial] court itself effectively raised the\nissue\u201d of his competence\u2014presumably on February 11, 2019, when the court\nwondered out loud whether it should have ordered a competency hearing earlier in\nthe case over the defense\u2019s objections. Lawson relies on State v. Bock, 28 Ohio\nSt.3d 108, 110, 502 N.E.2d 1016 (1986), in which this court stated: \u201c[T]here is no\nquestion that where the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is raised\nprior to the trial, a competency hearing is mandatory.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.37(B).\nLawson\u2019s argument is not clear, but he seems to imply that a competency hearing\nwas required under Bock because the trial court itself had \u201craised\u201d the issue of\ncompetence.\n       {\u00b6 67} We disagree. While a trial court may raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency, see R.C. 2945.37(B), the trial court in this case was not exercising this\nauthority. In essence, the trial court was asking the defense whether it wanted a\ncompetency hearing. Asking the defense whether it wants a hearing does not by\nitself make a hearing mandatory. The fact that the trial court did not order a\ncompetency evaluation and hearing, when it had the authority to sua sponte do so,\nshows that the court did not intend to raise the issue of Lawson\u2019s competence.\nMoreover, even if a competency hearing were mandatory under Bock, the failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nhold one would be harmless error in this case: \u201c[I]t is clear that the failure to hold\na mandatory competency hearing is harmless error where the record fails to reveal\nsufficient indicia of incompetency.\u201d Bock at 110.\n                    4. No support for the dissent\u2019s per se rule\n        {\u00b6 68} As set forth above, the Supreme Court has established, and Ohio has\nadopted, specific procedures to adequately protect an incompetent defendant from\nbeing tried or convicted. The dissent, however, advocates for the adoption of a per\nse rule\u2014that a competency examination and hearing are required at the instant in\nwhich a capital defendant pursues an adverse-interest request, such as entering a\nplea of guilty.\n        {\u00b6 69} There is no compelling reason to adopt that per se rule. As the Fifth\nCircuit has held:\n\n\n        [W]e decline to adopt a per se rule that, as a matter of law, a trial\n        court must doubt a capital punishment defendant\u2019s competency, or\n        conclude that such defendant does not understand the proceedings\n        against him or appreciate their significance, or conclude that he\n        cannot rationally aid his attorney in his defense simply because it is\n        obvious to the court that the defendant is causing his trial to be\n        conducted in a manner most likely to result in a conviction and the\n        imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\nRoberts v. Dretke, 381 F.3d 491, 498 (5th Cir.2004).\n        {\u00b6 70} A per se rule is also incongruous with the Supreme Court\u2019s position\nthat there is no one sign that triggers the need for a competency evaluation.\n\n\n        [E]vidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at\n        trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but\n       that even one of these factors standing alone may, in some\n       circumstances, be sufficient. There are, of course, no fixed or\n       immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further\n       inquiry to determine fitness to proceed; the question is often a\n       difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle\n       nuances are implicated.        That they are difficult to evaluate is\n       suggested by the varying opinions trained psychiatrists can entertain\n       on the same facts.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) Drope, 420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103.\n       {\u00b6 71} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Lawson\u2019s first proposition of\nlaw.\n III. VALIDITY OF LAWSON\u2019S JURY WAIVER AND GUILTY PLEAS\n       {\u00b6 72} In his second proposition of law, Lawson contends that both his jury\nwaiver and his subsequent guilty pleas were invalid because they were not knowing,\nvoluntary, and intelligent. This proposition essentially restates the claims made in\nhis first proposition of law; the same three circumstances that the first proposition\ncalls \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d are here relied upon as reasons to question the\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent character of his jury waiver and guilty pleas.\nLawson also argues that before accepting his waiver and pleas, the trial court should\nhave advised him that a single juror could prevent a death sentence. For the reasons\nthat follow, we reject both claims.\n                               A. The Jury Waiver\n       {\u00b6 73} \u201cIn addition to determining that a defendant who seeks to plead\nguilty * * * is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself that the waiver of his\nconstitutional rights is knowing and voluntary.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 400, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321. The United States Supreme Court has explained the\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\ndistinction between a competency determination and an inquiry into the knowing\nand voluntary character of a rights waiver as follows:\n\n\n               The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant\u2019s mental\n       capacity; the question is whether he has the ability to understand the\n       proceedings. * * * The purpose of the \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d\n       inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actually\n       does understand the significance and consequences of a particular\n       decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 401, fn. 12, quoting Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 28, 113\nS.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).\n       {\u00b6 74} A jury waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. E.g.,\nState v. Ruppert, 54 Ohio St.2d 263, 271, 375 N.E.2d 1250 (1978). Waiver may\nnot be presumed from a silent record; however, if the record shows that a jury\nwaiver occurred, the verdict will not be set aside except on a plain showing that the\nwaiver was not freely and intelligently made. Adams v. United States ex rel.\nMcCann, 317 U.S. 269, 281, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). Moreover, a\nwritten waiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. United States\nv. Sammons, 918 F.2d 592, 597 (6th Cir.1990). See generally State v. Bays, 87\nOhio St.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126 (1999).\n       {\u00b6 75} In this case, Lawson executed and filed a written jury waiver.\nAttached to the waiver was the following certification by defense counsel:\n\n\n               We, the undersigned, as counsel for defendant Arron\n       Lawson, have consulted with our client, explained his Constitutional\n       rights to a trial by jury, and made inquiry to determine if his decision\n       * * * was based upon any promises or coercive tactics * * * and\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        explained to him the process of trial by three-judge panel. We find\n        no evidence of any promises or coercive tactics * * *. We recognize\n        that his waiver of jury trial is voluntary. And we believe his waiver\n        is knowingly and intelligently made.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 76} By itself, the fact that a defendant is taking prescription medications\n\u201cdoes not defeat the presumption that his written waiver was knowing, intelligent,\nand voluntary.\u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d\n180, at \u00b6 30. Lawson points to nothing to show \u201cthat he, in fact, failed to understand\nthe waiver proceedings or the effect of his decision to waive\u2014or that his decision\nwas somehow involuntary\u2014because of the prescription medications.\u201d Id.\n                                B. The Guilty Pleas\n        {\u00b6 77} \u201cPrior to accepting a guilty plea from a criminal defendant, the trial\ncourt must inform the defendant that he is waiving his privilege against compulsory\nself-incrimination, his right to jury trial, his right to confront his accusers, and his\nright of compulsory process of witnesses.\u201d State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473,\n423 N.E.2d 115 (1981), paragraph one of the syllabus, following Boykin v.\nAlabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242-243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); see also\nCrim.R. 11(C)(2)(c).\n        {\u00b6 78} In this case, the trial court complied with Ballard and Crim.R.\n11(C)(2)(c) by informing Lawson that his guilty plea waived his rights to confront\nthe state\u2019s witnesses, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to require the state\nto prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial in which he would have had the\nright not to testify against himself.\n        {\u00b6 79} Lawson initiated the decision to plead guilty, \u201cinsisted upon it\nagainst advice of counsel, and held to it through a lengthy plea colloquy,\u201d State v.\nFitzpatrick, 102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 40. In\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nFitzpatrick, this court concluded on similar facts that it was \u201cclear\u201d that a capital\ndefendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was voluntary. Id.\n        {\u00b6 80} Nevertheless, Lawson contends that his plea was not voluntary,\nknowing, and intelligent, because (1) the trial court did not inquire into why he was\nnot following counsel\u2019s advice, (2) the trial court did not inquire more deeply into\nthe nature and effects of the medications Lawson was taking, and (3) the trial court\naccepted the waiver and pleas without a hearing on Lawson\u2019s competence.\n        {\u00b6 81} Lawson argues that when a defendant chooses, contrary to his\ncounsel\u2019s advice, to waive a jury trial or plead guilty, the trial court has a duty to\ninquire into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s decision. But he cites no authority for\nthat position.\n        {\u00b6 82} The decisions whether to waive a jury trial and whether to plead\nguilty belong to the defendant, not counsel. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745,\n751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). A defendant\u2019s election to exercise his\nright to reject his counsel\u2019s advice does not imply that his decision could not have\nbeen knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. To draw such an inference would negate\nthe defendant\u2019s right to decide these matters for himself.\n        {\u00b6 83} Lawson also asserts that his decision to reject counsel\u2019s advice was\n\u201cessentially\u201d equivalent to waiving the right to counsel altogether. We reject this\nassertion; there is an obvious difference between Lawson\u2019s situation\u2014having the\nassistance of counsel, but rejecting counsel\u2019s advice\u2014and having no counsel at all.\n        {\u00b6 84} Lawson also argues that the trial court failed to conduct a sufficient\ninquiry into the prescription drugs he was taking. He contends that the trial court\nshould have asked what the medications were for, who prescribed them, how long\nLawson had been taking them, when he had taken them last, and what effects they\nmay have had on his mental state.\n        {\u00b6 85} Lawson cites Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, at \u00b6 66, in which this court stated: \u201cAdditional inquiry is necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ninto a defendant\u2019s mental state once a defendant seeking to enter a guilty plea has\nstated that he is under the influence of drugs or medication.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 86} However, in Montgomery, we rejected a similar claim on similar\nfacts. The defendant in Montgomery argued that the three-judge panel inadequately\ninquired \u201cinto the effect, if any, that his prescription medications had on his mental\nstate.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 44.\n        {\u00b6 87} When the presiding judge in Montgomery learned at the jury-waiver\nhearing that the defendant was taking prescription medications for mental illness,\nthe judge asked \u201cwhether he had been prescribed the medications and whether he\nwas taking them pursuant to the prescription.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49. The judge also \u201cdirectly\nasked him whether he understood the constitutional rights he was forgoing by\nwaiving his right to a jury, whether he was doing so voluntarily, and whether his\ncounsel had reviewed the jury waiver with him prior to the hearing.\u201d Id. The panel\nlater conducted a plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and \u201cMontgomery\nanswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion.\u201d\nId. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 88} Moreover, \u201c[t]he panel had no reason to believe that Montgomery\nhad any issues with competence or could not intelligently and voluntarily enter a\nguilty plea.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47. Neither the defendant nor counsel in Montgomery \u201cever\nmade any representation to the court that he had any * * * issues with competency.\u201d\nId. The panel specifically asked at the plea hearing\n\n\n        whether [defense counsel] had any reason to believe that\n        [Montgomery] was not competent or capable of voluntarily and\n        intelligently pleading guilty. Defense counsel * * * were aware that\n        Montgomery was medicated for depression, yet they * * * never\n        raised an issue to the court about Montgomery\u2019s ability to\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        understand the proceedings and enter a knowing and voluntary\n        guilty plea.\n\n\nId. at \u00b6 51.\n        {\u00b6 89} In the end, \u201cthere [was] no evidence * * * that Montgomery was not\nin full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point during the\npendency of his case.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180,\nat \u00b6 52. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cthe panel\u2019s inquiry into Montgomery\u2019s\nmental state and use of prescription medications and in its acceptance of\nMontgomery\u2019s guilty plea was adequate and that Montgomery voluntarily and\nknowingly pleaded guilty to capital murder.\u201d Id.\n        {\u00b6 90} The facts of this case closely parallel those of Montgomery. During\nthe plea colloquy, the trial court asked Lawson whether his medications prevented\nhim from understanding what his attorneys or the court told him and whether they\naffected his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court also\nasked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen any indication that Lawson\u2019s\nmedications were affecting his reasoning ability or judgment. Neither Lawson nor\nhis counsel indicated at any point \u201cthat he had any * * * issues with competency,\u201d\nMontgomery at \u00b6 47. Moreover, as in Montgomery, the panel in this case conducted\na plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and Lawson \u201canswered each of the\npanel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion,\u201d id. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 91} \u201cIn short, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that [Lawson]\nwas not in full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point\nduring the pendency of his case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52. \u201c[C]onsidering the totality of the\nevidence,\u201d id., the panel\u2019s inquiry into Lawson\u2019s mental state and use of\nprescription medications was sufficient to comply with Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350,\n2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n      C. Failure to Advise that Single Juror Can Block Death Sentence\n        {\u00b6 92} Lawson contends that his jury waiver and guilty pleas were not\nvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent because the trial court did not tell him that a\nsingle juror can block a death sentence. However, we have rejected that contention.\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 30, citing\nBays, 87 Ohio St.3d at 19-21, 716 N.E.2d 1126; see also Fitzpatrick, 102 Ohio\nSt.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 NE.2d 927, at \u00b6 42-48; Sowell v.

INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        {\u00b6 93} In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance. To establish ineffective assistance, Lawson must\nshow (1) deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective\nstandard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been\ndifferent. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052,\n80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989),\nparagraphs two and three of the syllabus.\n                A. Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation\n        {\u00b6 94} Lawson argues that his counsel should have requested a competency\nevaluation, which would have led to a competency hearing.\n        {\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.37(B) entitles the defense to a pretrial competency\nhearing upon request: \u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas, * * * the\ncourt, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to\nstand trial. If the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\nhold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense\ncounsel is not ineffective in failing to request that the trial court order a competency\nevaluation or hold a competency hearing when the defendant does not display\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. State v.\nThomas, 97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 96} Lawson contends that counsel\u2019s decision not to request a\ncompetency evaluation cannot be justified as a strategic decision, because\nrequesting an evaluation would have had no possible \u201cdownside.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 97} Lawson\u2019s assertion that there is no downside to requesting a\ncompetency evaluation in this type of situation is questionable: defense counsel\nmay risk straining their relationship with their client when they question his mental\ncompetence and seek to negate his decisions. But in any event, competent counsel\nwould not request an evaluation unless they had some reason to doubt the\ndefendant\u2019s competence. Here, nothing in the record shows that Lawson\u2019s counsel\nhad any such reason.\n       {\u00b6 98} Lawson contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate the\ncompetency issue before declining to request a competency evaluation. He argues\nthat an expert opinion on Lawson\u2019s competence was essential, because counsel\u2019s\n\u201carmchair opinions\u201d were not a sufficient basis on which to make such a decision.\nHe further argues that the record fails to show that defense counsel ever sought an\nexpert opinion.\n       {\u00b6 99} Lawson points to defense counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court on\nFebruary 11, 2019, the day Lawson first announced that he wanted to waive a jury\nand plead guilty. One of the prosecutors asked whether Dr. Stinson could render\nan opinion on competence based on conversations Dr. Stinson and Lawson had\nalready had. One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied:\n\n\n               I can\u2019t commit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that. I know\n       psychologists that I have worked with in the past would probably\n       say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a completely different review and assessment,\u201d\n       and they\u2019re looking for different things than the context of\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       presenting possible psychological information for purposes of\n       mitigation.\n               Obviously [Dr. Stinson] would have more familiarity with\n       this young man than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be\n       done in a manner, although I * * * haven\u2019t thought through whether\n       that would create some sort of a conflict in terms of what his\n       testimony would be in the mitigation phase.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Lawson reads this statement as indicating \u201cthe limited scope of Dr.\nStinson\u2019s services[,] which did not include a competency examination.\u201d But\ndefense counsel did not say that Dr. Stinson could not render such an assessment.\nHe said only that he could not guarantee that Dr. Stinson would be able to form an\nopinion of Lawson\u2019s competence based on the interviewing Dr. Stinson had done\nup to that point. Indeed, counsel went on to say that Dr. Stinson \u201cwould have more\nfamiliarity with [Lawson] than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be done\nin a manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n       {\u00b6 101} Lawson goes on to assert that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that\nindicates that Dr. Stinson or any other mental health professional did, or was even\nasked to do, a competency evaluation on\u201d Lawson. Lawson\u2019s argument misplaces\nthe burden of persuasion: a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal must show from the record that the elements of the claim\nexist. Therefore, Lawson must show that his counsel failed to perform an adequate\ninvestigation of his possible incompetence. See, e.g., State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d\n448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 244.\n       {\u00b6 102} Lawson also ignores what defense counsel said during the plea\nhearing on February 21. During that hearing, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys expressly\nstated that counsel had conducted an investigation into competency issues and that\nthey had consulted Dr. Stinson:\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n               JUDGE BALLARD: * * * [A]t any point did you ever have\n       any concerns that might be raised by Adkins [sic, Atkins v. Virginia,\n       536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002)], or any\n       mental defect or mental deficiency that could have been identified\n       in Mr. Lawson that would have prevented him from knowingly and\n       intelligently and voluntarily entering into this plea waiver?\n               MR. MCVAY [defense counsel]: Not being a psychologist\n       or a psychiatrist * * * I\u2019m not in a position * * * to technically\n       answer that. But based on my many years of experience and 24\n       years as a practicing attorney handling a substantial number of death\n       penalty cases * * * and having had clients who would be Adkins-\n       qualified or otherwise incompetent to enter a plea, * * * I have no\n       reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of those\n       categories at this point in time based upon my discussions with him\n       and many hours spent with him, over 17 months, as well as the time\n       spent with him today.\n\n\n(Capitalization sic.)\n       {\u00b6 103} The presiding judge then asked counsel: \u201c[I]s it safe for this panel\nto assume that you conducted appropriate investigation from your practice into any\nissue that would be addressed by Adkins or mental issues or competency issues?\u201d\nCounsel replied:\n\n\n               We did, your Honor. In keeping with the American Bar\n       Association Guidelines for the Representation of Defendants\n       Charged with Capital Crimes and their recommendation, if not\n       insistence, that we engage a forensic psychologist to work with and\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       examine the defendant in the course of our representation, * * * that\n       in fact has been done. * * *\n               Having said that, and having discussed matters with * * *\n       Dr. Stinson at length, I think I can fairly represent that by virtue of\n       the fact that we have not filed any pleadings pertaining to a possible\n       incompetency to proceed in this matter * * *, I feel that we\u2019re on\n       safe ground in that respect in the sense that we have done our due\n       diligence with regard to that * * *. We have looked into all of those\n       matters, discussed most, * * * I would suggest all of those matters\n       with Mr. Lawson. I believe that we\u2019re on solid ground to move\n       forward with what his intentions are at this point in time.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) This statement indicates that Dr. Stinson examined Lawson and\nthat defense counsel consulted Dr. Stinson in determining whether to further pursue\nthe issue of Lawson\u2019s competence. Lawson cites nothing in the record that either\ncontradicts counsel\u2019s representations or shows that the investigation that had been\nconducted was deficient.\n       {\u00b6 104} Finally, Lawson is unable to show prejudice resulting from\ncounsel\u2019s declining to request a competency evaluation. It is true that if Lawson\u2019s\ncounsel had requested an evaluation, the trial court would have been required by\nstatute to order one.   But that says nothing about the likely outcome of the\nevaluation and of the hearing. To show prejudice, Lawson must show that there is\na reasonable probability that an evaluation \u201cwould have revealed that he was\nincompetent to stand trial,\u201d Alexander v. Dugger, 841 F.2d 371, 375 (11th\nCir.1988).\n       {\u00b6 105} As we concluded in relation to Lawson\u2019s first proposition of law,\nthe record simply contains insufficient indicia of incompetence to require a\ncompetency evaluation or a competency hearing. If defense counsel had requested\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\na competency evaluation, the trial court would have had to hold a hearing. But the\nalleged indicia of incompetence that Lawson repeatedly cites would have been\ninsufficient to overcome the legal presumption of competence, because they do not\nsuggest that Lawson was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the\nproceedings against him or of assisting in his own defense. The record of the\npenalty phase contains numerous references to Lawson\u2019s mental-health history,\nincluding diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, and posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). However, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere\nmental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be\nemotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the\ncharges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 110, 502\nN.E.2d 1016. Accordingly, the record does not show a reasonable likelihood that\nthe trial court would have found Lawson incompetent to stand trial.\n              B. Failure to Argue Mercy As a Mitigating Factor\n       {\u00b6 106} In another part of his third proposition of law, Lawson contends\nthat his counsel were ineffective because they failed to renew a pretrial motion to\ninstruct the jury on mercy as a mitigating factor and because they did not argue\nduring the penalty phase that mercy was a mitigating factor.\n       {\u00b6 107} As the state points out, any issues concerning jury instructions\nbecame moot once Lawson waived a jury trial. However, Lawson also contends\nthat counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue before the three-\njudge panel that mercy is a mitigating factor. That facet of his claim is obviously\nnot rendered moot by Lawson\u2019s jury waiver.\n       {\u00b6 108} However, the claim lacks merit, as we have repeatedly held that\nmercy is not a mitigating factor. See, e.g., State v. Belton, 149 Ohio St.3d 165,\n2016-Ohio-1581, 74 N.E.3d 319, \u00b6 88; State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-\nOhio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955, \u00b6 253. Hence, counsel did not perform deficiently by\ndeclining to argue otherwise.     \u201cDefense counsel is not required to advance\n\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\narguments lacking merit. * * * It is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to\nmaneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested or rejected legal\ntheories.\u201d State v. McNeill, 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 449, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998).\n       {\u00b6 109} Lawson also fails to show prejudice. Defense counsel in this case\npresented extensive mitigating evidence focused on Lawson\u2019s dysfunctional family\nand upbringing, his alleged abuse, traumatic events in his life, and his diagnosed\nmental disorders. Their penalty-phase arguments to the panel concentrated on that\nevidence. Lawson does not explain how adding an express plea for mercy would\nhave been reasonably likely to make a difference in the penalty-phase outcome.\n       {\u00b6 110} We overrule Lawson\u2019s third proposition of law.\n                          V. SENTENCING OPINION\n       {\u00b6 111} In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the\npanel\u2019s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends\nthat the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against\nhim and improperly discounted the mitigating factors. We disagree.\n                 A. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s 12-page sentencing opinion begins with a\nstatement of facts. According to Lawson, the opinion includes several facts that\n\u201cmade the crime particularly disturbing\u201d and could only \u201cbe termed as\ninflammatory.\u201d Lawson contends that by mentioning these facts in the opinion, the\npanel \u201cemployed\u201d them as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\n       {\u00b6 113} The \u201cinflammatory\u201d facts Lawson refers to include the following:\nthat Lawson had sexual intercourse with Stacey\u2019s body after shooting her, that\nStacey had recently ended a sexual relationship with Lawson, that Lawson posed\nas D.H.\u2019s father to deceive D.H.\u2019s school into sending him home that day, that\nLawson \u201ctricked\u201d D.H. into entering the bedroom and shot him twice at close range,\nthat Lawson prepared in advance for the murders by propping a window open the\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nnight before, that he moved and covered the bodies, and that he was arrested two\ndays later \u201c[a]fter a manhunt.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 114} But a trial court does not \u201ccreate nonstatutory aggravating\ncircumstances\u201d merely by \u201cdiscussing the facts of the crime.\u201d State v. Robb, 88\nOhio St.3d 59, 82, 723 N.E.2d 1019 (2000). Moreover, the sentencing opinion here\ncorrectly identified the aggravating circumstances of which Lawson was found\nguilty as to each aggravated-murder count. When a trial court has correctly\nidentified the statutory aggravating circumstances pleaded and proved at trial, we\npresume that the trial court understood the difference between statutory aggravating\ncircumstances and the facts that describe the nature and circumstances of the\noffense. State v. Martin, 151 Ohio St.3d 470, 2017-Ohio-7556, 90 N.E.3d 857,\n\u00b6 137.\n         {\u00b6 115} Lawson points to nothing in the opinion that suggests that the panel\nused the facts as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Instead, he contends that\nthe opinion fails to affirmatively state that the facts were not so used, and he argues\nthat this failure suffices to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only\nthe aggravating circumstances to which Lawson pleaded guilty. However, the\nopinion does specifically state that the panel did not consider Lawson\u2019s alleged\naffair with Stacey or the other \u201coffenses charged in the indictment,\u201d which would\ninclude his abuse of Stacey\u2019s corpse, as aggravating circumstances.\n         {\u00b6 116} Lawson\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our precedent.             The\nopinion \u201cidentified only the applicable statutory aggravating circumstances * * *\nand listed no improper nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.              Therefore,\n[Lawson] has not rebutted the presumption that the court relied only upon the\naggravating circumstances it identified.\u201d State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio St.3d 175,\n2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, \u00b6 121.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n            B. Unconsidered or Improperly Discounted Mitigation\n        {\u00b6 117} Lawson also contends that the panel\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201ccontains\nweighing errors\u201d that violate the Eighth Amendment as construed in Lockett v.\nOhio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion),\nand Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The\nUnited States Supreme Court in Eddings held that the sentencer in a capital case\nmay not \u201crefuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 114. Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider\nsome mitigating factors and gave too little weight to others.\n        {\u00b6 118} Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider Dr. Stinson\u2019s\ntestimony bearing on the mitigating factor of Lawson\u2019s youth, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\nBecause Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the murders, the trial court\ngave little weight to this factor. However, the sentencing opinion does not discuss\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony that the human brain does not finish developing until a\nperson reaches his mid-20s; in particular, Dr. Stinson testified that this is true of the\nfrontal lobe, which is responsible for \u201cjudgment, reasoning, impulse control, [and]\nplanning.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s opinion does not discuss this testimony,\nLawson asks us to infer that the panel did not consider it.\n        {\u00b6 119} But \u201c[w]hile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of\nmitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio\nSt.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). A trial court\u2019s failure to discuss each\nmitigating factor in its opinion does not give rise to an automatic inference that\nfactors that were not discussed in the opinion were not considered. Obermiller, 147\nOhio St.3d 175, 2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, at \u00b6 125, citing State v. Roberts,\n137 Ohio St.3d 230, 2013-Ohio-4580, 998 N.E.2d 1100, \u00b6 54.\n        {\u00b6 120} Such an inference is warranted only in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d\nRoberts at \u00b6 64, and Lawson points to no such circumstances here. In Roberts, the\ndefendant\u2019s allocution contained \u201cpotentially significant mitigation,\u201d id., and \u201cwas\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthe only relevant matter * * * specifically placed before the trial court as\nmitigation\u201d (emphasis sic), id. at \u00b6 56; in those circumstances, the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to mention the allocution in the sentencing opinion warranted the inference\nthat the court had failed to consider the allocution.       But in this case, as in\nObermiller, the sentencing opinion \u201cdiscussed multiple mitigating factors,\u201d\nObermiller at \u00b6 126. Therefore, the inference that the trial court failed to consider\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony is not justified.\n       {\u00b6 121} Lawson also contends that the trial court erred by \u201cunreasonably\ndiscount[ing]\u201d or giving \u201cinsufficient consideration to\u201d his mitigating evidence\ngoing to various other factors\u2014i.e., assigning it no weight or insufficient weight.\nLawson contends that a trial court violates the holding in Eddings and the Eighth\nAmendment by assigning insufficient weight to a defendant\u2019s mitigation.\n       {\u00b6 122} As we have explained, this reading of Eddings is incorrect because,\nas stated in Harris v. Alabama, 513 U.S. 504, 512, 115 S.Ct. 1031, 130 L.Ed.2d\n1004 (1995), \u201cthe Constitution does not require a State to ascribe any specific\nweight to particular factors, either in aggravation or mitigation, to be considered by\nthe sentencer.\u201d The weight to be given to any mitigating factor is \u201c \u2018an individual\ndecision by the fact finder,\u2019 \u201d not a matter of law. State v. Davis, 139 Ohio St.3d\n122, 2014-Ohio-1615, 9 N.E.3d 1031, \u00b6 62, quoting State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d\n353, 369-370, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992), abrogated in part on other grounds, see\nState v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 402-403, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997).\n       {\u00b6 123} Quoting Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 42, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175\nL.Ed.2d 398 (2009), Lawson describes it as a case in which the United States\nSupreme Court held that a state supreme court \u201c \u2018either did not consider or\nunreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence\u2019 adduced in a post-conviction\nhearing.\u201d   But \u201cPorter does not stand for the proposition that the Eighth\nAmendment forbids a sentencer to \u2018discount\u2019 mitigating evidence introduced at the\npenalty phase of the trial.\u201d Davis at \u00b6 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Therefore, we overrule Lawson\u2019s fourth proposition of law.\n                             VI. SETTLED ISSUES\n       {\u00b6 125} Lawson\u2019s fifth proposition of law raises various oft-rejected\narguments against the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes\ngoverning its imposition and also raises similar arguments that the death penalty\nviolates international law. See, e.g., State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-\nOhio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 106, 109-120; State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164,\n169-174, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984). We summarily overrule this proposition of law.\nSee generally State v. Poindexter, 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568 (1988),\nsyllabus; State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 81, 521 N.E.2d 800 (1988).\n                 VII. INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW\n       {\u00b6 126} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Lawson\u2019s\ndeath sentences. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine (1) whether the\nevidence supports the trier of fact\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, (2)\nwhether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty\noutweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) whether the\ndeath sentences are proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.\n                        A. Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 127} The aggravated murder of Stacey Holston (Count 1) has two\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)), and a felony-\nmurder circumstance predicated on aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)).\n       {\u00b6 128} The aggravated murder of D.H. (Count 2) has five aggravating\ncircumstances: murder of a victim under age 13 (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)); murder\ncommitted to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another\noffense (R.C 2929.04(A)(3)); course of conduct; felony murder predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder predicated on kidnapping.\n       {\u00b6 129} The aggravated murder of Tammie McGuire (Count 3) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 130} The aggravated murder of Donald McGuire (Count 4) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 131} The evidence in the record, including Lawson\u2019s confession,\nsupports the panel\u2019s finding as to each of the aggravating circumstances.\n                              B. Mitigating Factors\n       {\u00b6 132} Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh any of the\nrelevant mitigating factors provided in R.C. 2929.04(B). These factors include\n\u2022      the nature and circumstances of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      the history, character, and background of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it, R.C.\n       2929.04(B)(1),\n\u2022      whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for\n       the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation,\n       R.C. 2929.04(B)(2),\n\u2022      whether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a\n       mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the\n       criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct\n       to the requirements of the law, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3),\n\u2022      the youth of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4),\n\u2022      the offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and\n       delinquency adjudications, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5),\n\u2022      if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\n       the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim,\n          R.C. 2929.04(B)(6),\n\u2022         and any other factors that are relevant to the issue whether the offender\n          should be sentenced to death, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\n                                         1. Age\n          {\u00b6 133} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), \u201c[t]he youth of the offender\u201d is a\nmitigating factor. Lawson was born in 1994 and was 23 years old when he\ncommitted these murders. Lawson\u2019s age \u201cqualifies as a mitigating factor under\nR.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\u201d State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842\nN.E.2d 996, \u00b6 195.\n          {\u00b6 134} In the penalty phase, Lawson presented testimony from Dr.\nStinson, a forensic psychologist.       Dr. Stinson testified that the human brain\ncontinues to develop until a person reaches his mid-20s. He specifically noted that\nthe frontal lobe\u2014which is responsible for things like judgment, reasoning, impulse\ncontrol, and planning\u2014is the last part of the brain to develop and does not reach\nfull development until the mid-20s.\n                                2. Prior Criminal History\n          {\u00b6 135} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), \u201c[t]he offender\u2019s lack of a significant\nhistory of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications\u201d is a mitigating\nfactor.    The trial court found that Lawson has no previous convictions or\ndelinquency adjudications.\n                             3. Mental Disease or Defect\n          {\u00b6 136} The diminished-capacity mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), is\ninapplicable. Although Lawson has been diagnosed with various mental disorders,\nincluding bipolar disorder, Dr. Stinson did not testify that any of them deprived him\nof \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform\n[his] conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). The other\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nmitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B) that are not addressed in this opinion\nare likewise inapplicable.\n                     4. History, Character, and Background\n       {\u00b6 137} Lawson\u2019s history, character, and background constituted the heart\nof his case in mitigation. In the penalty phase, Lawson presented three witnesses:\nCarolyn Taylor, Stephanie Bentley, and Dr. Stinson. Carolyn Taylor is Lawson\u2019s\nmother. Stephanie Bentley is his half-sister and Carolyn\u2019s daughter. Dr. Stinson\ninterviewed Lawson for a total of 12 hours during four sessions and also\ninterviewed Lawson\u2019s mother. He reviewed information obtained by a mitigation\nspecialist who had conducted interviews of Lawson, his mother, his stepmother\nMartha Lawson, his half-sisters Stephanie Bentley and Summer Riesner, and others\nfamiliar with Lawson and his family. Dr. Stinson reviewed children\u2019s services,\neducational, employment, medical, mental-health, and jail records pertaining to\nLawson, records pertaining to Carolyn Taylor\u2019s family background and upbringing,\nand other records.\n       {\u00b6 138} Dr. Stinson identified 11 \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d\n(\u201cACEs\u201d) that place a child at risk for adverse health, mental-health, and social\noutcomes. They are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical\nneglect, emotional neglect, \u201cintimate partner violence,\u201d violence against the\nmother, \u201csubstance misuse in the household,\u201d parental divorce or separation,\nmental illness of a household member, and the incarceration of a household\nmember. Dr. Stinson testified that a research study conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention found that ACEs relate to approximately 40\nnegative outcomes. The presence of four or five ACEs indicates \u201csignificantly\nincreased risk for negative outcomes,\u201d and the likelihood of negative outcomes\nrises with the number of ACEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 139} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson had experienced \u201cat least\u201d nine\nACEs. The only two Dr. Stinson failed to definitively find were sexual abuse and\nphysical neglect.\n         {\u00b6 140} Lawson was born in April 1994. His parents are Delbert \u201cRay\u201d\nLawson and Carolyn Taylor. He was the third of five children Carolyn had by five\ndifferent men. Both of Lawson\u2019s parents have been divorced and remarried\nmultiple times. Carolyn has lived on welfare, food stamps, and Social Security\ndisability benefits.\n         {\u00b6 141} Ray and Carolyn lived together for about a month; when Carolyn\nbecame pregnant with Lawson, Ray left her. Carolyn lost custody of Lawson in\n1995. Ray denied his paternity until a DNA test proved that he was Lawson\u2019s\nfather; after that, he sought and was awarded custody of Lawson. According to Dr.\nStinson, Martha Lawson recalled that Carolyn had dropped Lawson off at Ray and\nMartha\u2019s house coatless in the middle of a winter night with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nturn.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 142} Lawson lived with Ray and Martha until he was 16. Also living in\nthe Lawson household were Ray and Martha\u2019s son Ray Jr. and Martha\u2019s son James\nMunyon. Carolyn was entitled to visitation with Lawson on Wednesdays and\nalternate weekends.    However, she testified that sometimes Ray and Martha\ndeprived Lawson of a visit as a punishment.\n         {\u00b6 143} While living with Ray and Martha, Lawson was especially close to\nhis paternal aunt, Linda McFann. Carolyn testified that Linda was \u201clike a second\nmom\u201d to him. Unfortunately, Linda died in a house fire. Carolyn testified that\nLawson was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Linda\u2019s death. Dr. Stinson testified that Linda died\nin 2006, when Lawson was about 12 years old. According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson\nstill had not \u201cresolved\u201d his bereavement five years later. At that time, a neighbor\ntold Lawson that he was glad Linda was dead, and Lawson responded by\n\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthreatening the neighbor with a butcher knife. Lawson was hospitalized at a\nmental-health facility after this incident.\n        {\u00b6 144} Lawson was also quite close to the boyfriend of one of his aunts,\nwhom he called \u201cUncle Tracy.\u201d Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Tracy was the most\npositive influence in his life. But Tracy died of a heroin overdose in about 2016.\n        {\u00b6 145} When Lawson was 16, Ray and Martha divorced, and Ray moved\nto Kentucky, leaving his children behind. Custody of Lawson then reverted to\nCarolyn, who had married Carl Kelly. A few months later, Carolyn and Kelly broke\nup, but Lawson continued to live with Kelly, whom Bentley described as like a\nfather to Lawson. Dr. Stinson believed that Kelly was generally a positive influence\non Lawson and may have provided \u201csome positive role modeling.\u201d On the other\nhand, Bentley testified that Kelly sold a lot of marijuana and provided some of it to\nLawson. After moving out, Carolyn maintained contact with Lawson, seeing him\nevery few days and talking to him on the phone.\n        {\u00b6 146} Dr. Stinson described the \u201ccomplicated family structure\u201d within\nwhich Lawson was raised. Ray left Lawson\u2019s mother to marry Martha, and\nLawson\u2019s mother had a relationship with Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon, who was\nthe father of Lawson\u2019s half-sister Stephanie Bentley. Lawson was teased in school\nbecause of this \u201cweird\u201d family situation. Additionally, Lawson\u2019s grandfather\nfathered a child with one of his daughters-in-law (Lawson\u2019s aunt by marriage); that\nchild was referred to as Lawson\u2019s \u201cUncle Cuz\u201d because he was both uncle and\ncousin to Lawson.\n        {\u00b6 147} Since at least age 11, Lawson has repeatedly alleged that his father,\nstepmother, and other family members abused him. He described his father as an\n\u201cabusive asshole\u201d who would get drunk and punch him.\n        {\u00b6 148} Carolyn testified that during visitations, she sometimes saw\nunexplained injuries on Lawson. Once she saw stitches in his head. She said that\nsomeone once squeezed Lawson\u2019s ears so tightly that they were severely bruised\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand had turned black. Bentley remembered seeing this as well, but she never saw\nany other bruising or injures. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Martha would pinch his\nears to the point of bruising and would strike him in the face.\n       {\u00b6 149} On one occasion, Carolyn testified, a dark orange substance was\ndraining from Lawson\u2019s ear. Carolyn recalled that when she took Lawson to a\ndoctor to treat his ear, the doctor said that it looked as if someone had jabbed the\nmetal end of a pencil into Lawson\u2019s ear after removing the eraser.\n       {\u00b6 150} Dr. Stinson testified that according to the medical records he\nreviewed, there were two cases of drainage from Lawson\u2019s ears. The first instance\nof \u201cbloody drainage\u201d occurred when Lawson was three; almost a year later, Lawson\nexperienced the orange discharge that had been described by Carolyn from the same\near.   According to Dr. Stinson, medical records documented that Lawson\u2019s\nstepbrother, James Munyon, had shoved pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears; however, Dr.\nStinson did not make clear whether this behavior had caused the discharges.\n       {\u00b6 151} Dr. Stinson admitted that to his knowledge, no specific instances of\nabuse against Lawson had ever been substantiated. And although Dr. Stinson\nbelieved that Lawson was a victim of abuse, he eventually conceded that he did not\nknow whether Lawson had been abused. (Dr. Stinson did not classify the alleged\ninsertion of pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears as a type of \u201cabuse.\u201d)\n       {\u00b6 152} Dr. Stinson also testified that Lawson reported abuse \u201cover and\nover and over to people who did nothing.\u201d Dr. Stinson felt that the fact that\nLawson\u2019s claims went unheeded was actually \u201cmore relevant\u201d than whether he\nactually was abused, because it contributed to his feelings of being unloved:\n\n\n       We can look back on it and say \u201cWell, it * * * really wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n       From my standpoint what\u2019s more relevant is the fact that once he\n       reported his abuse, nobody did anything about it * * * and he\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       internalized [the belief that] nobody cares, nobody\u2019s going to protect\n       me, nobody loves me and I\u2019m unlovable.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 153} Lawson did tell his mother that he was being abused, and his\nmedical records showed that he reported past abuse to medical-health professionals\nduring his treatment sessions.\n       {\u00b6 154} However, when Lawson first alleged to authorities that he was\nbeing abused, the authorities did not ignore it; they investigated and found no\nevidence to support the claim. The penalty-phase evidence includes records for\nLawson and his family from the Lawrence County Department of Job and Family\nServices that were admitted as a court\u2019s exhibit. Those records include a children\u2019s\nservices report showing that Ray and Martha were investigated in 2006 after\nLawson reported to the Ironton police that he was being abused.\n       {\u00b6 155} According to the records, Lawson alleged that his stepmother\nslapped his face, his siblings \u201cput erasers in his ears,\u201d and his parents \u201chit him\neverywhere.\u201d But the investigator found only one small bruise on Lawson\u2019s knee,\nand that appeared to the investigator to be normal for a preteen child and to not\nhave been deliberately inflicted.\n       {\u00b6 156} The investigator learned that Lawson\u2019s father had recently spanked\nhim with a belt; however, the spanking was inflicted as a punishment after Lawson\nchoked his brother, Ray Jr., during a squabble. Martha told the investigator that\nLawson had expressed a desire \u201cto get his father in trouble like he was in trouble\nfrom choking\u201d his brother.\n       {\u00b6 157} Although Lawson has never reported that he was sexually abused\nand in fact has denied it, Dr. Stinson nonetheless suspected that Lawson may have\nbeen sexually abused as a child. He based this suspicion on the existence of\n\u201crampant\u201d sexual abuse in Lawson\u2019s family over the years. Carolyn\u2019s oldest son\nwas allegedly sexually abused and went on to abuse two sisters and a cousin.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLawson\u2019s stepbrother was sexually abused by a neighbor. One of Lawson\u2019s half-\nsisters was sexually abused by Carolyn\u2019s brother-in-law. A generation before,\nCarolyn\u2019s family members had been involved in numerous allegations of sexual\nabuse. Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson may have denied being sexually abused\nbecause it was so common as to become \u201cnormalized\u201d in his family.\n       {\u00b6 158} Lawson\u2019s mother, Carolyn Taylor, was raised in poverty; her\nfamily was dependent on welfare and food stamps, and the children were\nmalnourished. Carolyn grew up in a trailer that housed 12 people. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that \u201cthere were concerns that the boys and the girls were sharing bedrooms\nand sleeping together.\u201d The home was leaky and roach-infested and had no indoor\nbathroom.\n       {\u00b6 159} During Carolyn\u2019s childhood, numerous allegations of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were leveled against her parents and stepparents;\nmany of them were against her father in particular.             Children\u2019s services\ninvestigators were able to substantiate some of these allegations, but according to\nDr. Stinson, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, Dr. Stinson\ntestified that the \u201cremarkable\u201d number of allegations said a great deal about the\nculture of Carolyn\u2019s family.\n       {\u00b6 160} Dr. Stinson also stated that Carolyn suffered from \u201csignificant\nmental health problems.\u201d Documented symptoms he listed included agitation,\nanhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities), anxiety, crying spells,\ndisorganized thought, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, homicidal and\nsuicidal thoughts, hyperactivity, paranoia, panic attacks, phobic avoidance,\npreoccupation, self-mutilation, and feelings of worthlessness.          Her \u201cmood\ndisturbance\u201d manifested itself in the forms of severe depression, anger, euphoria,\nirritability, mania, and \u201cmixed moods,\u201d i.e., simultaneous symptoms of depression\nand mania.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 161} Dr. Stinson related that Carolyn had been diagnosed with anxiety\ndisorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, \u201cmoderate and recurrent\u201d major depressive\ndisorder, various forms of bipolar disorder including \u201cmixed [simultaneously manic\nand depressive] severe, with psychotic features,\u201d and schizoaffective disorder, a\npsychotic disorder combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She had been\ntreated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. Carolyn\u2019s\ndoctor had determined that her mental disorders left her \u201cfunctionally impaired,\u201d\nunable to carry on day-to-day activities. The Social Security Administration had\nfound that she was \u201cpermanently impaired and unable to engage in any gainful\nactivity.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 162} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson also had three relatives\u2014an\nuncle, aunt, and great-uncle\u2014who had attempted suicide. And Lawson described\na maternal half-brother as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and as having delusions. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that severe mental-health problems have a genetic component, so that the\nchildren of parents with severe mental-health problems are particularly at risk to\ninherit them.\n        {\u00b6 163} Lawson has in fact had mental-health problems and has been\ndiagnosed with mental disorders since childhood. Most significantly, in March\n2011, shortly before he turned 17, Lawson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and\nbipolar disorder. In April of that year, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at\nMercy Franciscan Hospital after a violent incident with his neighbor. Hospital staff\nmembers believed that past abuse had contributed to his emotional difficulties.\n        {\u00b6 164} Lawson continued to receive mental-health evaluations and\ntreatment in 2011 and 2012. During one psychiatric examination, he said he was\nhaving flashbacks to past abuse. In 2012, Lawson was hospitalized again because\nhe was contemplating injuring his neighbor.\n        {\u00b6 165} Since 2011, Lawson has been diagnosed repeatedly with depressive\ndisorder and PTSD. Dr. Stinson testified that when he interviewed Lawson, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nexhibited classic symptoms of depression and PTSD.                 Despite previous\nhospitalizations, Dr. Stinson testified, Lawson did not receive the kind of treatment\nhe needed.\n        {\u00b6 166} Lawson has had anger issues dating back to his childhood. During\nthe 2006 children\u2019s services investigation, the investigating social worker wrote\nthat she was concerned about Lawson\u2019s inability to control his anger. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that Lawson was enrolled in an anger-management class at age 13 because\nhe was unable to regulate his emotions; however, his stepmother removed him\nbecause the class took time away from his chores and homework. At age 16, he\nwas diagnosed with \u201canger disorder.\u201d Dr. Stinson noted that \u201cthere is no such thing\nas anger disorder,\u201d but he interpreted this diagnosis to mean that Lawson had a\nmood disorder in which anger was predominant.\n        {\u00b6 167} A consistent factor in Lawson\u2019s personality has been his repeatedly\nexpressed feelings that he was worthless; he described himself to Dr. Stinson as\nfeeling like \u201cjust a piece of crap\u201d and \u201clike a dog.\u201d Schoolmates made fun of his\nfamily and his first name. (His mother meant to name him \u201cAaron,\u201d but she\nmisspelled it as \u201cArron\u201d on his birth certificate. His preferred pronunciation is \u201cAr-\nron,\u201d with the emphasis on the second syllable, but people frequently mispronounce\nit.)   Bentley testified that Martha favored her own children over Lawson.\nAccording to Dr. Stinson, Lawson used marijuana to deal with feelings of\nemptiness and worthlessness.\n        {\u00b6 168} Lawson\u2019s family has an extensive history of drug and alcohol\nproblems. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that his father, Ray, was \u201cdrunk all the time.\u201d\nBentley testified that Ray drank \u201c[e]very day, all day long.\u201d Carolyn told Dr.\nStinson that Ray was \u201ca real bad drunk.\u201d During the period when Lawson lived\nwith Ray and Martha, Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon was released from prison and\nmoved into the household. Dr. Stinson testified that Munyon not only smoked\nmarijuana but traded it for sex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Despite Lawson\u2019s family history, Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson\nhimself did not have \u201csevere drug and alcohol problems.\u201d But Dr. Stinson stated\nthat Lawson did use marijuana and other drugs to cope with physical pain and\nemotional distress. Bentley testified that Lawson smoked marijuana frequently or\ndaily. Dr. Stinson diagnosed Lawson with a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d but he\nconceded that this disorder caused no major impairment of Lawson\u2019s functioning.\nThere was no evidence that Lawson had been using alcohol or drugs at the time of\nthe aggravated murders in this case.\n       {\u00b6 170} Lawson had numerous medical problems throughout his life.\nWhen he was two, a dog bit him on the cheek, although Carolyn testified that the\ninjury was not serious. At the age of three, he had a laceration to the forehead,\nrequiring stitches, and had skin-cancer surgery. At the age of four, his tongue was\nclipped twice to correct a speech impediment. Both the skin-cancer surgery and\nthe tongue clipping were outpatient procedures. At the age of 12, while playing\nwith his siblings, he was shot in one eye with an \u201cairsoft\u201d gun (similar to a BB gun,\nbut firing plastic or rubber pellets), causing temporary blindness in that eye. Dr.\nStinson testified that Lawson has continued to have \u201cvision problems\u201d since that\ninjury. In addition, Lawson\u2019s gallbladder was removed in 2010.\n       {\u00b6 171} In 2011, Lawson suffered multiple medical problems. Severe\nheadaches required several doctor and hospital visits.        He also experienced\ndegenerative disc disease, abdominal pain, and \u201cabnormal findings related to his\ncolon and appendix.\u201d In 2017, Lawson was in a \u201cfender-bender\u201d accident and\nstruck his head on a rear-view mirror. While he did not seek medical attention at\nthe time, he experienced chronic headaches after the accident.\n       {\u00b6 172} In addition to the above factors, Lawson expressed remorse for the\nmurders in his confession and in his unsworn statement. He told the panel, \u201cI know\nwhat I did was wrong\u201d and stated that he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for what he did. He\napologized to everyone he had harmed, including the four murder victims and his\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nown family. He said that he cannot sleep at night, cries all the time, cries himself\nto sleep, and has flashbacks. He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t expect sympathy. * * * If it\nbe death penalty, then I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m at peace with whatever you give me.\u201d\nLawson also expressed his remorse to Dr. Stinson, who felt that Lawson\u2019s remorse\nwas sincere.\n       {\u00b6 173} Dr. Stinson testified about Lawson\u2019s conduct in the Morrow\nCounty jail, where he was held pending trial. A jail supervisor described Lawson\nto Dr. Stinson as trustworthy, well behaved, respectful, and \u201cnot * * * a problem.\u201d\nOther correctional officers consistently told Dr. Stinson that Lawson was not\ncausing any problems.      Whenever Dr. Stinson saw Lawson interacting with\nofficers, they seemed to have a tension-free and professional relationship. On one\noccasion, Lawson gave jail staff members advance warning that several other\ninmates were planning to disrupt jail operations by flooding their toilets.\n       {\u00b6 174} Lawson\u2019s jail records showed two \u201cwrite-ups\u201d in the approximately\n16 months he was there. In January 2018, he got upset about a lockdown, kicked a\ndoor, and threatened an officer; he lost all privileges as a result. Dr. Stinson\ndescribed the other incident as \u201cequivocal.\u201d A Lawrence County deputy sheriff\nwho was transporting Lawson accused him of resisting him and of disrespect and\ndisobedience; however, a Morrow County deputy stated that there had been no\nproblem. Lawson was not disciplined for this incident. Overall, Dr. Stinson opined\nthat when compared to other inmates he had worked with, Lawson had adjusted to\nincarceration \u201crelatively\u201d well, even \u201cremarkably well.\u201d\n                   5. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n       {\u00b6 175} The trial court gleaned one mitigating factor from the\ncircumstances of the offense: while in the Holstons\u2019 house on the day of the\nmurders, Lawson fed two-year-old B.H., changed his diaper, and put him down for\na nap. Beyond that, nothing about the nature and circumstances of the offenses in\nthis case could be considered mitigating.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                     C. Weighing\n          {\u00b6 176} We must determine whether the aggravating circumstances that\nwere found by the three-judge panel outweigh the mitigating factors presented in\nthis case beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.05(A) and 2929.03(D)(1); see State\nv. Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, \u00b6 140. We\ndetermine that they do.\n          {\u00b6 177} Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is the strongest mitigating factor in\nthis case.     At various times, Lawson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,\ndepression, and PTSD, and he did not receive adequate treatment for these\ndisorders. See State v. Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3d\n841, \u00b6 209. We note in particular that bipolar disorder is \u201ca major mental illness.\u201d\nKetterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 205. Although\nDr. Stinson did not testify that the murders were attributable to Lawson\u2019s mental\ndisorders, we find that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is entitled to substantial\nweight.\n          {\u00b6 178} We must consider Lawson\u2019s youth as a mitigating factor. See R.C.\n2929.04(B)(4). This court has frequently upheld death sentences for 23-year-old\nmurderers and has ordinarily given the (B)(4) factor little weight in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at \u00b6 195\n(\u201clittle weight\u201d); State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d\n1173, \u00b6 173 (\u201cmodest weight\u201d); State v. Ferguson, 108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-\n1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b6 127 (\u201clittle weight\u201d). We recognize that we recently\naccorded \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the age of an offender in Graham, id. at \u00b6 207.\nHowever, Graham is fundamentally distinguishable. Graham had just turned 19 at\nthe time he committed aggravated murder, a little more than one year removed from\nthe minimum age for death-penalty eligibility. In contrast, Lawson was 23 when\nhe committed the murders at issue here, a more significant passage of time from\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe minimum age of eligibility. Therefore, we consider Lawson\u2019s youth to be a\nfactor that carries some weight.\n       {\u00b6 179} The evidence that Lawson was abused is not conclusive. The\nrecord does show, however, that Lawson experienced a degree of instability in his\nupbringing, with several changes in custody and living arrangements. The evidence\nalso shows that he was surrounded by poor role models and had few good role\nmodels and that he felt unloved and worthless.\n       {\u00b6 180} Because Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the four\naggravated murders in this case, he had at least some \u201ctime to distance himself from\nhis childhood and allow other factors to assert themselves in his personality and his\nbehavior,\u201d State v. Campbell, 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 53, 765 N.E.2d 334 (2002);\ncompare Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, at \u00b6 138\n(19-year-old offender was \u201cnot far removed\u201d from his upbringing).\n       {\u00b6 181} Yet we have \u201cseldom ascribed much weight in mitigation to a\ndefendant\u2019s unstable or troubled childhood.\u201d State v. Kirkland, 160 Ohio St.3d 389,\n2020-Ohio-4079, 157 N.E.3d 716, \u00b6 174, citing Campbell at 51-54; see also State\nv. Cooey, 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 41, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989). And Lawson\u2019s childhood\nsurely presents nothing comparable to State v. Tenace, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-\nOhio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, which we have noted as \u201c[t]he benchmark case for\nassessing the weight of childhood trauma\u201d based on its \u201cappalling facts,\u201d State v.\nBeasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-493, 108 N.E.3d 1028, \u00b6 248. The\ndefendant in Tenace was raised by criminal and drug-addicted parents, sold by his\nmother for sexual services, forced to watch his sister being sexually abused, and\nencouraged to cheat and steal. Tenace at \u00b6 102-103. Therefore, Lawson\u2019s history\nand background are entitled to some weight, \u201cbut only to the extent his \u2018criminal\n* * * acts are attributable to\u2019 it,\u201d Campbell at 53, quoting California v. Brown, 479\nU.S. 538, 545, 2017 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Although retrospective remorse is ordinarily not a strong mitigating\nfactor, \u201cremorse [that] leads to surrender and confession is a more impressive\nfactor.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 93, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991). In this case,\nLawson did surrender\u2014although that decision may have been influenced by a cold\nnight in the woods without supplies, shelter, or weapons. More importantly,\nLawson gave a complete, truthful confession that aided the police with their crime-\nscene investigation. Therefore, we find that Lawson\u2019s remorse and cooperation are\nentitled to some weight in mitigation. His generally good conduct in jail is also\nentitled to some weight.\n       {\u00b6 183} With respect to D.H.\u2019s murder, the aggravating circumstances\ninclude that Lawson engaged in a course of conduct\u2014i.e., committed multiple\nmurders\u2014and the fact that D.H. was younger than 13. \u201cIn particular, the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it\ninvolves the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 328. And the cold-blooded nature\nand details of D.H.\u2019s murder are especially significant concerns. Moreover, the\ncommission of multiple murders is a grave aggravating circumstance that carries\ngreat weight. State v. Hutton, 100 Ohio St.3d 176, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d\n948, \u00b6 91.   The two felony-murder circumstances and the escaping-detection\ncircumstance add still more weight to the state\u2019s side of the scales.\n       {\u00b6 184} The murders of Stacey and her parents lack the child-murder\naggravating circumstance, but each has a course-of-conduct and a felony-murder\ncircumstance. In addition, the murders of Stacey\u2019s parents have the escaping-\ndetection circumstance.\n       {\u00b6 185} Two recent cases in which we have found that aggravation did not\noutweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, Johnson and Graham, each\ninvolved 19-year-old defendants, both of whom \u201centered a residence to commit\nrobbery and killed a [single] person inside.\u201d Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio-6700, 172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 215. By contrast, Lawson was 23 years old; he\nentered the Holstons\u2019 residence and lay in wait specifically to kill; over a period of\n12 hours, he killed four people, one an eight-year-old child who should not even\nhave been in the house, and he attempted to kill a fifth.\n        {\u00b6 186} This case invites particular comparison with Graham, which it\nresembles in that both Lawson and Graham were young defendants who suffered\nfrom untreated or insufficiently treated mental-health issues and adverse\nenvironmental factors. See Graham at \u00b6 196. In fact, Lawson\u2019s mental disorders\u2014\nbipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety\u2014are more significant than\nGraham\u2019s oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, see id.\n        {\u00b6 187} However, this case is distinguishable from Graham in numerous\nimportant ways. We have already noted some of the key distinctions: Lawson was\nfour years older than Graham was when the crimes were committed; Lawson killed\nfour people to Graham\u2019s one; one of Lawson\u2019s victims was eight years old and that\ninnocent victim was in the house only because of Lawson\u2019s deception; Lawson\nentered the house where the crimes occurred with the express purpose of\ncommitting murder, unlike Graham, who entered for the purpose of robbery with\nno intention to kill anyone. And the list goes on.\n        {\u00b6 188} While Graham was the principal offender in the aggravated murder\nhe committed, he \u201cwas not the mastermind,\u201d 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700,\n172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 205, of the drug robbery that led to the murder; he was\nrecruited by a friend. In this case, Lawson was not just the principal offender; he\nwas the sole offender. Nobody recruited or enticed him; the whole thing was his\nidea.\n        {\u00b6 189} The murder in Graham was a quick reaction to events during the\nrobbery: Graham told the victim not to look at the robbers, the victim expressed\ndoubt that Graham would shoot him, and Graham shot him. Id. at \u00b6 12. In contrast,\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nLawson planned and prepared for Stacey\u2019s murder well in advance and committed\nfour murders over a 12-hour period in which the death toll mounted.\n         {\u00b6 190} Like Lawson, Graham used marijuana daily. But unlike Lawson,\nGraham was also addicted to Xanax, using \u201cmassive\u201d daily amounts of it, Graham\nat \u00b6 199. Moreover, Graham\u2019s Xanax use made him more irritable and aggressive\nand less inhibited. Id. at \u00b6 199, 210. Indeed, Graham\u2019s expert witness testified that\nit was unlikely that Graham would have committed the murder but for his Xanax\naddiction. Id. at \u00b6 199. Lawson had a cannabis-use disorder, but according to Dr.\nStinson it caused no major impairment of his functioning, and there is no evidence\nthat drug use played any role in the murders in this case.\n         {\u00b6 191} This case is undeniably one in which the defendant has presented\nsignificant mitigating factors. But this is also a case in which the defendant\nslaughtered four people, including the callous slaying of an eight-year-old child.\nWith respect to each of the four aggravated murders before us, we find that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n                                D. Proportionality\n         {\u00b6 192} We further determine that the death sentences for these crimes are\nproportionate to sentences approved in similar cases. We have approved death\nsentences in cases combining multiple murders with one or more child murders.\nState v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051; State v.\nPowell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865; Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242; Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347,\n2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180. Indeed, we have approved death sentences in\nnumerous cases that involved multiple murders when all the victims were adults.\nSee, e.g., State v. Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, 89 N.E.3d 554\n(two murders, one attempted murder); Beasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n493, 108 N.E.3d 1028 (three murders, one attempted murder); State v. Madison,\n160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867 (three murders).\n                              VIII. CONCLUSION\n       {\u00b6 193} We affirm the judgments of conviction. We further affirm all four\nsentences of death.\n                                                                Judgment affirmed.\n       FISCHER and DEWINE, JJ., concur.\n       DONNELLY, J., concurs, with an opinion.\n       O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in judgment only and concurs in Justice\nDonnelly\u2019s concurring opinion.\n       STEWART, J., concurs in part and dissents in part and would reverse the\ndeath sentences.\n       BRUNNER, J., dissents, with an opinion.\n                               _________________\n       DONNELLY, J., concurring.\n       {\u00b6 194} Respectfully, I fully concur with this court\u2019s judgment affirming\nappellant Arron L. Lawson\u2019s convictions. I reluctantly concur, however, with this\ncourt\u2019s judgment affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentence.\n       {\u00b6 195} Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder, and depression, there is no denying that Lawson suffers from serious\nmental illnesses and that he did not receive adequate treatment for these disorders.\nOf these diagnoses, bipolar disorder has been found to be a major mental illness.\nSee State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 172,\n205. The majority opinion recognizes that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history was\nsubstantial and accorded it the mitigating factor entitled to the strongest weight.\nSee majority opinion at \u00b6 177. The General Assembly has also recognized the\ncritical importance of this issue, see 2020 Am.Sub.H.B.

Atkins at 321. The\nUnited States Supreme Court has also prohibited the execution of juveniles,\nrecognizing their developmental immaturity and diminished culpability. Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-571, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). In Ohio,\nthe General Assembly has recently prohibited the imposition of the death penalty\nfor the crime of aggravated murder when the defendant had a serious mental illness\nat the time that he committed the offense. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.02(A), 2929.025,\nand other statutes enacted in 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136. This case is therefore\nabout more than whether appellant, Arron Lawson, was able to consult with his\nlawyers and reasonably understand the proceedings against him. This appeal is an\nopportunity for this court to reexamine the protections and precautions that are\ncentral to ensuring that any death sentence that is imposed is appropriate and\nsubjected to a reliable, deliberate, and rigorous constitutional review.\n       {\u00b6 199} Former Justice Paul Pfeifer stated when he served as a justice of\nthis court that \u201c[t]he death penalty should be reserved for the most severe of cases.\u201d\nState v. Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 75, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (1999) (Pfeifer, J.,\ndissenting); see also State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 563, 747 N.E.2d 765\n(2001) (Pfeifer, J., dissenting) (the death penalty should be imposed only on \u201cthose\nmurderers who truly deserve death\u201d).           It is difficult to imagine Lawson\u2019s\nhorrendous acts not falling into the category of the worst of cases. But this court is\nconstitutionally bound to not only review Lawson\u2019s sentence but also to verify the\nintegrity of the process leading to the imposition of the death penalty as the\npunishment for his crimes. This should not be a mechanistic analysis; it should be\na thorough endeavor that closely examines all aspects of the proceedings that have\nculminated in our review. Because there are too many unaddressed concerns in the\nmajority\u2019s analysis, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n   I. Lawson\u2019s Competency to Enter Guilty Pleas and Waive a Jury Trial\n            A. A trial court\u2019s duty regarding a defendant\u2019s competency\n       {\u00b6 200} When the issue of competency is \u201craised\u201d before trial by counsel\nfor a criminal defendant, by the prosecution, or by the court, a hearing on the matter\nis mandatory. R.C. 2945.37(B); State v. Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016 (1986). Likewise, after the conclusion of the trial-court proceedings, if a\nperson who was convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death wanted to forgo\nfurther legal challenges, essentially volunteering for death, this court has required\nthat the person undergo a competency evaluation and that the trial court hold a\nhearing before such a request would be honored. See State v. Berry, 74 Ohio St.3d\n1492, 658 N.E.2d 1062 (1996) (ordering that an independent psychiatric expert be\nappointed); State v. Berry, 77 Ohio St.3d 1439, 671 N.E.2d 1279 (1996) (remanding\nthe matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on mental competency). For\nthe period of litigation lying between the two markers of a death-penalty\nproceeding\u2014i.e., before the trial and during or following the sentencing (such as\nforgoing an appeal or forgoing other legal challenges)\u2014there are points at which a\ndefendant\u2019s decision or request may or is likely to be an indicator that his\ncompetency to assist in his own defense should be determined pursuant to R.C.\n2945.37(G), such as when a defendant indicates his or her wish to terminate\ncounsel\u2019s representation, when a defendant indicates his or her wish to waive a jury\ntrial, and when a defendant indicates his or her wish to forgo the presentation of all\nor some mitigating evidence at sentencing.         These pivotal points along the\ncontinuum of a death-penalty prosecution are critical events that could serve in\nwhole or in part to tip the scales of justice toward or away from the ultimate\npunishment\u2014death.\n       {\u00b6 201} Therefore, it is understood that R.C. 2945.37(B) dictates that when\nrequested before trial, a competency examination is mandatory and that when a\ndefendant wishes to waive the ability to challenge an imposed death sentence, a\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncompetency hearing is required, see State v. Berry, 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 375, 686\nN.E.2d 1097 (1997).      However, clear guidelines are lacking about the way\ncompetency should be questioned and examined in the stages that occur between\nthe period before the start of a trial and the final imposition of a death sentence.\nThus, trial courts have been free to apply whatever standards they choose during\nthose stages, and their decisions are not overturned on appeal unless there are\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d in the record, State v. Were, 94 Ohio St.3d\n173, 761 N.E.2d 591 (2002), paragraph two of the syllabus. This court has stated\nthat \u201c \u2018[c]ommon sense dictates that no defendant can make a record of lack of\ncompetency absent the findings and hearings contemplated by R.C. 2945.37 and\n2945.371.\u2019 \u201d Were at 177, quoting Bock at 113 (Wright, J., dissenting). Thus,\nrelying on a record when there is no requirement to create one is hardly the model\nof fair process, and it cannot in any sense be deemed rigorously constitutional.\n                   B. Indicia of incompetency in Lawson\u2019s case\n       {\u00b6 202} Lawson has raised three areas of concern that, taken together,\nshould be held to have triggered the trial court\u2019s duty to order a pretrial\nincompetency exam: when Lawson acted against the advice of his counsel by\nwaiving a trial and entering guilty pleas, when Lawson exhibited indecisiveness\nabout his decision to enter guilty pleas, and when Lawson revealed to the court that\nhe was taking prescription medications. Going against the advice of counsel, alone,\ndoes not equate with incompetence. Indecisiveness, alone, may not necessarily\nconstitute a clear indicator that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Nor may\ntaking prescription medications, standing alone, be a clear indicator of\nincompetence. Our inquiry in this appeal, however, is not whether we believe that\nLawson was competent; it is whether these factors taken together should be held to\nreasonably indicate to a trial court that further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s\ncompetency is required, to ensure the fairness of the proceeding, especially in a\ncapital case. See R.C. 2945.37(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                      January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 203} There were indicia, i.e., signs or indications, that should have\nprompted\u2014and did prompt\u2014the trial court to further inquire about concerns of\npossible \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d regarding Lawson\u2019s competency to\nwaive a trial and change his pleas. On multiple occasions, the trial court raised the\nissue of a possible competency evaluation.1 The record is clear that the presiding\ntrial judge was hesitating and \u201csecond-guessing\u201d whether the types of\nconsiderations underlying Atkins, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335,\nand other precedents had been observed or applied. The trial judge appeared\nhesitant about Lawson\u2019s thought process in making the grave and weighty decision\nto plead guilty in a proceeding that could carry the consequential punishment of\ndeath.\n         {\u00b6 204} Lawson\u2019s actions in waiving his right to a jury trial and entering\npleas of guilty to multiple capital offenses, combined with the trial court\u2019s\nhesitations, were indicia of incompetency that do exist in our limited record,\nconsidering that no competency examination or hearing ever occurred. It should\nnot be our role to guess from the evidence what Lawson\u2019s state of mind was and\ntherefore what his mental capabilities were.                If he had been assessed for\ncompetency, we would be able to read a report from a mental-health professional\nabout his ability and state of mind. Without that kind of evidence, it is difficult to\ndiscern from the record whether Lawson was exercising the rights of a rational,\nmentally and physically healthy person in making this decision. See Berry, 80 Ohio\nSt.3d at 375, 686 N.E.2d 1097, quoting Smith v. Armentrout, 812 F.2d 1050, 1057\n(8th Cir.1987) (it is \u201c \u2018very probable\u2019 \u201d that in \u201c \u2018every case\u2019 \u201d in which a capital\n\n\n1. The majority opinion outlines the discussions between the trial judge and counsel regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency, including an in-chambers discussion on February 11, 2019. During that\ndiscussion, the trial judge noted that he had \u201cbrought this [issue] up months ago\u201d and was now\n\u201csecond-guessing\u201d his decision to decline to order a competency evaluation. Further discussion in\nthe record occurred on February 21, 2019, when the presiding trial judge asked counsel whether\nthey had any concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d and\ninquired as to counsel\u2019s investigation of those issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                               59\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant desires to \u201c \u2018abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility\nthat the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect\u2019 \u201d). That we\nwould guess or infer what a competency evaluation would have shown debases our\nunique role in reviewing death-penalty appeals.\n       {\u00b6 205} The record is clear that when the trial court during the plea colloquy\nasked Lawson whether his mental clarity was affected by any medications, Lawson\ndisclosed that he was taking several\u2014naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and\nZoloft. The trial court questioned Lawson and defense counsel regarding these\nmedications and asked whether they could be affecting Lawson\u2019s ability to reason\nor his judgment. And while there is no affirmative indication in the record that\nLawson\u2019s medications did affect his ability to understand or reason, more inquiry\ncertainly was in order. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 174-175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103 (discussing whether, in light of inferences drawn from the undisputed evidence,\nthe trial court\u2019s failure to further inquire into a defendant\u2019s competency deprived\nhim of a fair trial). Unanswered questions remained: Why was he taking those\nmedications? How long had he been taking those medications? What medical\ndiagnoses and symptoms indicated that those medications should be prescribed?\nWas he experiencing or had he ever experienced any side effects from those\nmedications, including drowsiness, confusion, or suicidal thoughts? A competency\nexam could have provided answers to these questions to allay concerns regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency.       Lawson\u2019s statement that he was taking prescription\nmedications was, at a minimum, a legitimate factor relating to the fundamental\nquestion of his competency to stand trial and to decide to plead guilty to capital\nmurder.\n       {\u00b6 206} The majority, citing State v. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717\nN.E.2d 298 (1999), reasons that the trial court and defense counsel were able to\nobserve Lawson and that he exhibited no behavior that raised any question as to his\ncompetency. There are a number of reasons why licensed members of the legal\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nprofession and the judiciary should not perform competency evaluations based on\ntheir own observations, either directly or indirectly by reading a record. Using this\nmethod to make what amounts to a medical determination that a person charged\nwith a capital crime is or was competent is not only constitutionally flawed, it is\nunacceptable. This is particularly so when there is evidence that a defendant is\ntaking prescription medications that may affect his or her behavior or demeanor.2\nNo one asked Lawson whether drowsiness or confusion might be a side effect of\nany of his medications.           No one asked Lawson whether any of his current\nmedications were prescribed for impulse control. No one asked Lawson whether\nhe was depressed or suicidal. And no one asked him on the record why he was\nchoosing to plead guilty to capital offenses.\n         {\u00b6 207} Lawson\u2019s decision to waive a trial and enter pleas of guilty in this\ncapital case, combined with the trial court\u2019s apparent misgivings as they appear in\nthe record, support that further inquiry into Lawson\u2019s competency was necessary.\nI would thus reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment based on this issue and would\nremand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings regarding Lawson\u2019s\ncompetency.\n  C. R.C. 2945.37(B) requires a hearing when the issue of competency is raised\n         {\u00b6 208} The majority rejects Lawson\u2019s argument that R.C. 2945.37(B)\nrequired a competency hearing in this case, concluding that the issue was not\nsufficiently raised at trial and that, even if it had been, not raising it was harmless\nerror. When \u201cthe issue of the defendant\u2019s competence\u201d to stand trial is \u201craised\u201d\nbefore the trial has begun, \u201cthe court shall hold a hearing on the issue.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) R.C. 2945.37(B). The statute does not require the issue to be sufficiently\n\n\n2. According to information available on the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website, drowsiness is a side effect\nof most of the medications Lawson was taking; confusion is a side effect of Vistaril and\nmetronidazole; and suicidal thoughts, loss of memory, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality\nare side effects of Zoloft. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs (accessed July 9, 2021)\n[https://perma.cc/UL5E-XLDS].\n\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nraised, raised by motion, or raised with the intention of obtaining or ordering a\nhearing. See id. (\u201cthe court, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue\u201d).\n        {\u00b6 209} On multiple occasions before the trial began, the trial court itself\nraised the issue whether a competency evaluation should be done. See fn. 1 of this\nopinion, supra. The majority interprets the record to indicate that the trial-court\njudge was merely asking the defense whether it wanted a competency hearing. But\nisn\u2019t it just as plausible that the trial judge was truly questioning whether there was\nenough information available to reach a sound conclusion that Lawson was\ncompetent to not only stand trial but to waive it? At any rate, this was not a situation\nin which the trial judge specifically stated that Lawson \u201c \u2018evidenced no mental\ninstability,\u2019 \u201d Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298. Rather, the court\n\u201craised\u201d the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency for purposes of R.C. 2945.37(B).\n        {\u00b6 210} Nothing prohibits this court from reviewing the record and\ndetermining that the issue of competency was raised. Nothing prohibits us from\nremanding this case for a competency evaluation to be conducted and a competency\nhearing to be held; the result of that hearing would determine the course of events\nfrom that point. Such a hearing is required by statute, but one was not held. If we\ndo this, we would accomplish several important aims. We would acknowledge the\ngravity of any capital defendant\u2019s adverse-interest request to plead guilty to a\ncapital offense. We would also provide valuable guidance to this state\u2019s trial courts\nthat creating a sound record compliant with R.C. 2945.37(B) is required, especially\nwhen the defendant is making an adverse-interest decision, such as waiving a trial\nand pleading guilty to one or more capital offenses. Remanding this case for a\ncompetency hearing would be of benefit to the public in ensuring a high standard\nof compliance with due-process principles in cases in which a death sentence could\nbe imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 211} The issue of Lawson\u2019s competency was raised, requiring the trial\ncourt to hold a competency hearing. See Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016; R.C. 2945.37(B). We should require that this hearing be held.\n                 D. General problems with the current framework\n       {\u00b6 212} When a capital defendant seeks to abandon his or her rights and\nacquiesce in entering a guilty plea, essentially clearing the thorny thicket on the\npath toward execution by the state, we owe that defendant, the victims and their\nfamilies, the lower courts, and the public at large a standardized approach to ensure\nfairness and uniformity in trials of this gravamen. Viewing the record using the\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d method falls short, because it is based on\ngleaning information from a record when often no record was made.\n       {\u00b6 213} It is not acceptable to simply rely on the observations of the trial\ncourt and/or the experiences and opinions of defense counsel that a criminal\ndefendant is competent to stand trial.        The dissenting opinion in State v.\nMontgomery, relying on State v. Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 66, and United States v. Damon, 191 F.3d 561, 565 (4th Cir.1999),\nsquarely addressed this point:\n\n\n       The majority seems to be satisfied that [appellant, Caron\n       Montgomery,] stated in open court that he understood what he was\n       doing and that he signed a written waiver. This conclusion was\n       bolstered by the opinion of Montgomery\u2019s attorney\u2014who was not a\n       medical expert\u2014that Montgomery understood the rights that he was\n       waiving. But if medication prevented Montgomery from truly\n       comprehending his actions, how reliable were his spoken assurances\n       and his signed statement to the contrary? The trial court did not\n       inquire about whether or how the medications affected\n       Montgomery\u2019s abilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n               I believe that more was required under Mink and Damon. At\n       the very least, when someone is undoubtedly under the influence of\n       a prescription medication when making the decision to enter a guilty\n       plea, the trial court must inquire about the effects of the medication\n       so that it can ensure that the defendant understands the gravity of the\n       situation and comprehends his or her actions. This court should not\n       affirm a conviction, let alone a death sentence, by guessing about\n       the mental competence of a defendant. Further inquiry was required\n       before the trial court accepted Montgomery\u2019s plea of guilty.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71\nN.E.3d 180, \u00b6 196-197 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting). Most attorneys and judges are not\npracticing mental-health or disability experts. Relying on a defense attorney\u2019s\nopinion, when that opinion is likely to be a one-off (based on how defense counsel\ninterprets the defendant\u2019s behavior at that particular juncture of the trial),\nanecdotally based opinion on the defendant\u2019s competency is neither a sound legal\nnor ethical practice.   Judging a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity to reason and\nunderstand through observed behavior by defense counsel and/or the court,\nespecially when coupled with a grave, adverse-interest decision such as pleading\nguilty to one or more capital offenses, denies due process when the defendant is\ntaking prescription medication with clinical indications and side effects that\nresearch shows may affect sound reasoning at the time the defendant changes his\nor her plea. And, finally, there is an inherent and systemic flaw that may not even\nbe recognized when we perpetuate reliance on judges\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 subjective\nassessments of a capital defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or change a plea:\nperhaps we perpetuate predisposed ideas and stereotyped, culture- or race-based\nperceptions and predispositions about what is acceptable behavior during a trial.\nSee State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 62-\n\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n63 (giving deference to those who saw and heard the proceedings and stating that\nthe defendant \u201cdisplayed no outrageous, irrational behavior during trial\u201d).

In examining cases in which this court has considered the issue whether a competency\nexamination or hearing should have been conducted when a defendant made a request adverse to\nhis own interest, this court has overwhelmingly held that insufficient indicia of incompetency were\npresent.

Id. at 175-176.\nWe determined that this perfect storm of facts met the \u201csufficient indicia\u201d test: a\ndefense attorney who was adept at recognizing potential incompetency, a defendant\nwhose behavior rose to such a level that his counsel believed that he was not able\nto understand the proceedings against him, and the existence in the record of\nnumerous motions and requests for a competency assessment. Id. This court\u2019s\ndecision today permits and perpetuates a practice that a clinical evaluation of the\nmental competence of a defendant in a death-penalty case is not needed when a\ndefendant pleads guilty to the crime, even though there is ample evidence in the\nrecord of his mental illness. And we find today that no medical evaluation for\ncompetency is required when a defendant\u2019s experienced attorney\u2014by self-\nproclamation\u2014has adjudged his client to be competent based on counsel\u2019s stated\nability to recognize mental illness, even when that client may not outwardly\ndemonstrate visible symptoms of mental illness to nonclinical laypersons during\nthe limited time they interact with them.\n       {\u00b6 215} In short, the approach perpetuated in this case denies criminal\ndefendants accused of capital crimes the guarantee that the laws of this state will\nbe applied in a rigorously constitutional manner when the consequences may be\nirrevocable. We should not continue to rely on indicia in the record as sufficient to\ndetermine a defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty without requiring evidence\nbased on sound medical judgment. It is incumbent on this court to require in death-\npenalty cases what is now readily at our disposal\u2014the use of science in a\ncompetency evaluation so that the state puts to death only those whom we may\nfairly determine have knowingly and competently pleaded guilty. In doing this, we\nwould avoid what amounts to guessing who is competent based on \u201cindicia\u201d (that\nmay or may not make it into the record) in favor of science-based evidence that is\ninformed by evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n     E. The need for evidence-based practices and not just indicia in the record\n        {\u00b6 216} On February 21, 2019, when the trial court held a change-of-plea\nhearing for Lawson, the presiding judge asked defense counsel whether they had\nany concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency.\u201d\nLead defense counsel first informed the court that he was not \u201ca psychologist or a\npsychiatrist\u201d and was not in a position to \u201ctechnically answer\u201d that question.\nDefense counsel then informed the trial court that Dr. Bob Stinson had been\nconsulted on the issue and that the defense did not intend to raise the issue of\nLawson\u2019s competency. At this point in the proceedings, there was nothing in the\nrecord about Lawson\u2019s being suicidal, having attempted suicide in the past, having\nexperienced (or at the time experiencing) confusion and possible hallucinations, or\ntaking several medications. The fact that those indicia were not yet in the record at\nthis point does not negate their existence. It does, however, demonstrate the\ninherent flaws in this court\u2019s current \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d test.\n        {\u00b6 217} Defense counsel, the prosecutors, and the trial court entertained the\npossibility of having Dr. Stinson render an opinion on Lawson\u2019s competency. Dr.\nStinson had been hired as a mental- and behavioral-health expert for the mitigation\nphase of the trial. He was not hired to perform a competency examination for the\npurpose of trial. However, had the trial court been able to conduct at least a review\nof his written report at this juncture of the proceedings, the following would have\nbecome apparent:\n1.      Lawson was raised in a dysfunctional family, suffered from poverty,\n        emotional abuse, and probably physical abuse, and was exposed to familial\n        incest;\n2.      Lawson\u2019s family members had a history of mental illness, including bipolar\n        disorder, depression, and suicidal behavior, and had a history of alcoholism\n        and drug abuse; Lawson\u2019s mother was rated as being \u201csignificantly\n        functionally impaired\u201d by her physician;\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n3.     Lawson had mental-health problems starting at least by age 13, when he\n       was enrolled in anger-management classes; he was diagnosed with bipolar\n       disorder in 2011; he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on two\n       occasions following suicidal and homicidal episodes; he has been diagnosed\n       with depressive disorder and posttraumatic-stress disorder;\n4.     Since his psychiatric hospitalizations, he has been on a number of\n       medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressant medicines,\n       antipsychotic drugs, and a medication to help with sleep and to control\n       impulses;\n5.     After his arrest, Lawson was seen by staff members at Shawnee Mental\n       Health, where he disclosed that he had attempted to hang himself several\n       years before and reported that he had been having thoughts of suicide;\n6.     After his arrest, Lawson was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and\n       reported to Dr. Stinson that he was having trouble sleeping and\n       concentrating and was occasionally having auditory and visual\n       hallucinations.\n       {\u00b6 218} This information about Lawson was not discussed at all at this point\nin the proceedings even though it is discussed in this court\u2019s majority opinion. The\nArron Lawson identified and described in Dr. Stinson\u2019s report is a person impaired\nby mental illness who has a stated history of being suicidal. The trial court was not\npresented with this information until the mitigation phase of the proceeding, and\nthis is precisely an example of the problem with the test this court adopted in the\npast and once again applies in Lawson\u2019s case. Had the trial court simply ordered a\ncompetency examination, as was discussed at several junctures during the trial\nphase, the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency to stand trial would have been made clear\nin the record beyond the mere presence of vague indicia that the record now\ncontains.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 219} Putting someone to death for his or her crimes, even when the\ncrimes are heinous and when it is apparent that the person on trial is the person who\ncommitted the crimes, is always subject to the constitutional due-process principles\ncontained in the Bill of Rights, a document once demanded by, and its contents now\nguaranteed to, the people. Due-process principles are not satisfied by guessing or\nby the acknowledged inexactitude of gleaning indicia from a sketchy trial record.\nThe determination of Lawson\u2019s competency should be based on evidence. That the\nquestion of his competency was \u201craised\u201d was enough to require the trial court to\norder a competency evaluation and a hearing on the matter under R.C. 2945.37(B),\nno matter what his attorney said to the court. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 177, 95 S.Ct.\n896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (finding that even when a question of competency is inartfully\nraised \u201cit would have been, at the very least, the better practice to order an\nimmediate examination\u201d).\n          {\u00b6 220} No longer should this court rely on the mere scaffolding of\ntradition, intuition, and prior case authority for determining a matter that is the\nsubject of scientifically supportable evidence, especially when a statute (R.C.\n2945.37(B)) requires otherwise.       The benefits of requiring evidenced-based\npractices when determining a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial are similar to\nthe benefits that are detailed in clinical literature for programs involving everything\nfrom medicine and nursing, to education, to mental-health and substance-abuse\nservices, to psychiatry, to the imposing of criminal-justice sanctions and more. See,\ne.g., Social Programs that Work, http://www.evidencebasedprograms.org\n(accessed July 9, 2021) [https://perma.cc/T76K-9KFZ].

This governmental center \u201cprovides communities,\nclinicians, policy-makers and others with the information and tools to incorporate\nevidence-based practices into their communities or clinical settings.\u201d Id. The\ncenter\u2019s website contains a plethora of publications on both substance abuse and\nmental illness, including co-occurring disorders, for both youths and adults. This\ncourt should be requiring that evidence-based practices be the standard for\ncompetency evidence used by the courts of this state for what are essentially clinical\nconclusions regarding defendants\u2019 competency to stand trial. Once we do this, we\nwill have taken a giant stride to ensure that due-process principles are adhered to in\nthe prosecutions of persons accused of crimes, especially those accused of\ncommitting capital crimes.\n     F. Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest request\n       {\u00b6 221} When reading the fact pattern of violence and often torture that\noccurs in nearly every death-penalty case, the reader is left to conjecture: Who in\ntheir right mind could do such a thing? Since that perception is present from the\nbeginning, and since an adverse-interest request such as agreeing to plead guilty to\na capital offense as charged could be viewed as irrational and against the\ndefendant\u2019s self-interests, it would be best for courts to start from a presumption\nthat competency is at issue whenever a defendant makes an adverse-interest\nrequest. Starting with this presumption and questioning competency in this way\nwould mean that a trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2945.37(B) would be ensured.\nThe trial court would then be required to conduct further inquiry, thus creating a\nrecord and instilling a more reliable, constitutional approach.\n       {\u00b6 222} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest alleviates the necessity for a court to inquire as to defense counsel\u2019s position\non the subject. The judiciary must dismiss the temptation to put defense attorneys\nin the position of assessing their clients\u2019 capabilities, which goes beyond the\nattorneys\u2019 expertise and their ethical duties. We also should steer courts away from\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nlooking for subjectively bizarre behavior and encourage them to simply obtain\ninformation from a clinical expert using evidence-based practices.\n       {\u00b6 223} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest also triggers the building of a record. A competency examination and a\nhearing would be the most comprehensive way to ensure a complete and thorough\nrecord. The trial court should make a finding one way or the other based on\nevidence in the record regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand\nchoices and assist in his or her own defense. This includes determining whether\nthe defendant possesses the ability to comprehend the ramifications of his or her\ndecision, including understanding that the choice may lead to death, determining\nwhether the defendant is able to make such a decision knowingly and intelligently,\nnot unduly affected by conditions of mental health, physical health, or\nimprisonment, and determining whether the defendant possesses the ability to\nreason logically and fully understands the ramifications of his decision. Berry, 80\nOhio St.3d at 371, 374-376, 686 N.E.2d 1097.\n       {\u00b6 224} For example, in State v. Mink, in which the defendant was charged\nwith aggravated murder for the horrendous stabbings and beatings of his parents,\nthe trial court sua sponte appointed two psychologists to conduct separate\ncompetency examinations when Mink first informed the court that he wished to\nenter pleas of guilty to all counts, to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand to represent himself. 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064,\nat \u00b6 31, 59-60. The trial court then made an initial determination based on the\nreports of those psychologists that Mink was competent to stand trial and accepted\nhis guilty pleas and later made a separate determination that Mink was competent\nto waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, after which it sentenced him to\ndeath. Id. at \u00b6 22-26, 60. This court affirmed Mink\u2019s death sentence and he was\neventually executed as he had requested, see id. at \u00b6 26, but because the trial court\nhad insisted on and had conducted a thorough, evidence-based process, we were\n\n\n\n\n                                         71\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nnot left to doubt the constitutionality of Mink\u2019s death sentence with regard to his\ncompetency. We noted that the trial court had gone \u201cto great lengths\u201d before\nfinding him competent, id. at \u00b6 59, and that the court had \u201cfully protected Mink\u2019s\nconstitutional rights in determining his competency,\u201d id. at \u00b6 61.\n        {\u00b6 225} Perhaps not every decision a defendant in a capital case makes that\nis against his or her interest should trigger a competency evaluation, but it would\nbehoove courts to proceed thoughtfully and cautiously. For example, a clinical\nexamination might not be required when a defendant wishes to waive representation\nby counsel. When making a decision like that, the defendant still has procedural\nand substantive protections in place. Courts should seek to examine a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency in view of the context and purpose of the proceeding. Therefore,\ncompetency evaluations should be specifically tailored to address the capacity and\nthe ability of the defendant to understand the ramifications of the specific adverse-\ninterest request he or she is making. See Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 150, 150-\n151, 86 S.Ct. 1320, 16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966).4\n\n4.

No. 2000-CR-2900 (June\n28, 2001):\n\n                 Applying the criteria set forth in State v. Ashworth (1999), 85 Ohio St.3d\n        56, [706 N.E.2d 1231,] and Based upon the Court\u2019s inquiry of the Defendant\n        conducted in open court and the competency reports of Dr. Thomas O. Martin and\n        Dr. Kim Stookey, the Court finds that the Defendant:\n                 1.) Understands the choice between life and death,\n                 2.) Has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to\n                 pursue the presentation of evidence,\n                 3.) Fully understands the ramifications of his decision,\n                 4.) Possesses the ability to reason logically, i.e. to choose means that\n                 relate logically to his ends,\n                 5.) Understands his right to present mitigating evidence,\n                 6.) Understands the meaning of mitigating evidence,\n                 7.) Understands the importance of mitigating evidence,\n                 8.) Understands the use of mitigating evidence to offset the aggravating\n                 circumstances and,\n                 9.) Understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence.\n                 The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n        presentation of mitigating evidence is made knowingly, intelligently and\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 226} Additionally, requiring that a record be developed when a\ndefendant invokes an adverse-interest request ensures balance in the system. If\nLawson had been asked further questions, his suicidal ideation and suicide attempt\nmay have become known to the court, as counsel presumably were aware of those\nmatters. At that point, any court would certainly have sought further information\nabout the defendant\u2019s mental health and capabilities before allowing the trial to\nproceed for the state to seek his execution. See Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d at 64, 706\nN.E.2d 1231 (noting the state\u2019s interest \u201cin not allowing the death penalty statute\nto be used as a means of state-assisted suicide\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 227} Because we must ensure rigorous compliance with constitutional\nstandards in capital cases, I cannot concur in affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentences\nunder our current framework of analysis.\n       II. The Validity of Lawson\u2019s Jury-Trial Waiver and Guilty Pleas\n       {\u00b6 228} Insofar as Lawson\u2019s claims that his waiver of a jury trial and pleas\nof guilty were not done knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, for the same\nreasons articulated above that the court should have ordered a competency\nexamination, I cannot concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record supports\nthat Lawson\u2019s pleas were fairly entered, underpinned by an adequate ability to\nreason and understand the proceedings against him.\n       {\u00b6 229} In accepting the waiver and pleas, even if the trial court had\ncomplied with State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 423 N.E.2d 115 (1981),\nparagraph one of the syllabus, and with Crim.R. 11, and even if the trial court had\nsufficiently inquired about Lawson\u2019s use of medications, Lawson was never asked\nwhy he wanted to enter the guilty pleas; his answer to that question may have\nclarified his lack of perceived or real duress, delusion, misunderstanding, or\nsuicidal motivation.\n\n       voluntarily. The Court therefore accepts the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n       presentation of mitigating evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 230} For these reasons, this court should be encouraging trial courts to\nthoroughly and appropriately examine a defendant\u2019s competency and state of mind\nwhen the defendant makes an adverse-interest request\u2014such as pleading guilty to\none or more capital offenses\u2014rather than tolerating trial courts\u2019 failures to comply\nwith R.C. 2945.37(B).\n                                  III. Conclusion\n       {\u00b6 231} Because this court should not endorse a death sentence when the\nconstitutionality of a defendant\u2019s convictions remains in doubt, I respectfully\ndissent from the majority\u2019s judgment. I would reverse Lawson\u2019s convictions and\nthe sentences of death. I would further remand this case for the trial court to order\na competency examination that it contemplated ordering before it accepted\nLawson\u2019s guilty pleas and to hold a hearing based on the findings and\nrecommendations contained in that evaluation, in accord with what I believe this\ncourt\u2019s holding should be, as expressed in this dissenting opinion.\n                               _________________\n       Brigham M.

Lawson, murdered four\npeople: Stacey Holston, her eight-year-old son D.H., her mother, Tammie McGuire,\nand her mother\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire. On October 13, Lawson surrendered\nto police and confessed to the murders.\n        {\u00b6 3} The Lawrence County grand jury returned an 11-count indictment,\nincluding four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications.\nLawson entered guilty pleas to all counts and specifications of the indictment.\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.06, a three-judge panel of the common pleas court heard the\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nstate\u2019s evidence of guilt with regard to the capital charges. The panel found Lawson\nguilty of four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications as to\neach count. The panel then conducted a sentencing hearing and sentenced Lawson\nto death for each aggravated murder.\n       {\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Lawson raises five propositions of law. We overrule\neach of the propositions of law. After conducting an independent review, we\nconclude that although significant mitigating factors exist, the aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\nof the four aggravated murders. We further conclude that each death sentence is\nappropriate and proportionate. Therefore, we affirm all four death sentences.\n                 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                     A. Facts\n       {\u00b6 5} Arron Lawson was Stacey Holston\u2019s first cousin. Stacey lived with\nher husband, Todd Holston, and their sons, D.H. and two-year-old B.H., near Pedro,\nOhio. Lawson lived nearby and was in the habit of visiting the Holstons daily.\n       {\u00b6 6} Lawson was infatuated with Stacey; he told his mother that she was\n\u201cthe love of his life.\u201d In his confession, he stated that he and Stacey had been\nhaving a sexual affair, which Stacey had broken off \u201c[a]bout a week ago,\u201d i.e.,\napproximately October 6, 2017.\n       {\u00b6 7} Lawson visited Stacey on Tuesday, October 10, 2017, the day before\nthe murders, while Todd was at work. During this visit, Lawson surreptitiously\nentered a bedroom at the back of the house, opened a window, and inserted a book\nbetween the window and the sill to hold the window partly open. By his own later\nadmission, he did this with the intention of entering the house the next day to\ncommit murder.\n       {\u00b6 8} At about 7:15 p.m., when Todd came home, Lawson was still there\nwith Stacey and the children. At Stacey\u2019s request, Todd drove Lawson home. Todd\ntestified at trial that Lawson \u201cwasn\u2019t too happy about\u201d being sent home.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The next morning, Todd left for work at approximately 4:30 a.m.\nAbout half an hour later, Lawson entered the Holstons\u2019 residence through the rear\nwindow. He had a 20-gauge shotgun, eight shells loaded with slugs, and a backpack\ncontaining flashlights, toilet paper, knives, a tarp, and other items. Lawson hid in\nthe back bedroom until about 8:30 a.m.\n       {\u00b6 10} Meanwhile, D.H.\u2019s school bus arrived and D.H. left the house to go\nto school. Stacey sent with him a note directing the school to put D.H. on a different\nbus that afternoon than he normally rode and to take him to his grandparents\u2019 house.\n       {\u00b6 11} By 8:30, after D.H. had left, Stacey was in the home with B.H.\nStacey entered the back bedroom where Lawson was hiding, and Lawson shot her\nthree times in the chest and shoulder. She fell to the floor.\n       {\u00b6 12} Lawson dragged her body to D.H.\u2019s bedroom where he lifted her\nonto a futon bed and, using a condom, had sex with her corpse. Lawson discarded\nthe condom in the kitchen wastebasket. He then returned to the bedroom and\ncovered Stacey\u2019s body with a blanket and the futon\u2019s mattress.\n       {\u00b6 13} As these events were occurring, Todd was at a worksite in Maysville,\nKentucky, where he clocked in at 6:43 a.m. It was Stacey\u2019s habit to send Todd a\ntext message early every morning to make sure he had arrived safely at work. When\nshe failed to do so on October 11, Todd began to worry. He repeatedly tried to call\nand text her throughout the day, but she did not respond.\n       {\u00b6 14} At 9:23 a.m., Lawson used Stacey\u2019s cell phone to call D.H.\u2019s school.\nPosing as Todd, Lawson told the school\u2019s guidance secretary that D.H.\u2019s\ngrandfather was unable to watch D.H. that day, so D.H. should be taken home on\nhis usual bus that afternoon. Lawson spoke calmly and gave the guidance secretary\nno reason to doubt he was who he claimed to be. Because Lawson was using\nStacey\u2019s phone, the phone number on the school\u2019s caller ID matched the number\non file in the office. So the original arrangement was canceled and D.H. was\nbrought home after school. Meanwhile, Lawson waited at the Holstons\u2019 residence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nHe fed B.H., changed his diaper, and later put him down for a nap in the main\nbedroom.\n        {\u00b6 15} When D.H. arrived home, Lawson sat with him in the living room\nand they talked about school. However, D.H. began asking Lawson where his\nmother was and when his father was coming home. Lacking answers, Lawson told\nD.H. that Lawson\u2019s PlayStation 3 was in D.H.\u2019s room behind the dresser. D.H.\nwent to his bedroom. As D.H. looked behind his dresser, Lawson shot him twice,\nonce in the arm and once in the torso. Lawson left the boy\u2019s body where it fell and\ncovered it with clothes. After killing D.H., Lawson continued to wait in the\nHolstons\u2019 residence.\n        {\u00b6 16} Around 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., Todd tried again to contact Stacey on his\nway home from his worksite. He then called Stacey\u2019s mother, Tammie McGuire,\nwho lived about a quarter mile from the Holstons. Tammie agreed to check on\nStacey and drove to the house. A few minutes later, she called Todd back and told\nhim that she was at his house but that the door was locked. Todd authorized her to\nbreak in, and she did. The phone connection remained open. A few minutes later,\nTodd heard Tammie scream, \u201cOh, my God\u201d followed by a loud noise. Then, as\nTodd later testified, \u201call of a sudden it was just quiet.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 17} By Lawson\u2019s account, he was in the main bedroom when he heard\nTammie forcing her way into the house. He hid behind the bedroom door; when\nTammie opened that door, he stepped out and shot her. Lawson dragged Tammie\u2019s\nbody to the laundry area and threw a blanket over her. He then used her keys to\nmove her truck behind the house.\n        {\u00b6 18} Meanwhile, Todd phoned Tammie\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire, and\napprised him of the situation. Donald said he would go and check, and he walked\nto the house.\n        {\u00b6 19} According to Lawson, Donald initially tried to enter through the\nback door, but it was locked, so Donald went around to the locked front door and\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u201crammed through.\u201d When Donald came in, Lawson shot him and dragged the body\nto D.H.\u2019s bedroom.\n        {\u00b6 20} About 10 to 20 minutes later, Todd arrived home. When he came\nthrough the front door, Lawson attacked him with a knife, stabbing him a number\nof times in the head, neck, and torso. Todd wrested the knife from Lawson and\npinned him to the couch.\n        {\u00b6 21} Todd asked Lawson why he had attacked him.            According to\nLawson, he then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a blind thing of anger.\u201d But\nTodd testified that Lawson had said, \u201cThere\u2019s been people breaking in out here, and\nI thought you was one of them.\u201d According to Todd, Lawson then \u201cshook like he\nsnapped out of something.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 22} Todd also asked Lawson where Stacey and the children were.\nLawson said they were in the bedroom and were \u201cokay.\u201d Todd testified that he\nthen forcefully removed Lawson from the house. Lawson drove away in the truck\nbelonging to the McGuires.\n        {\u00b6 23} Todd checked on B.H., who was unharmed. (According to Lawson,\nB.H. slept through at least the first three murders.) Todd then looked through the\nhouse. After finding the bodies of Tammie, Stacey, and Donald, he took B.H. and\ndrove to the McGuires\u2019 house, where he borrowed a cell phone from Tammie\u2019s\nbrother and called 9-1-1.\n        {\u00b6 24} Lawson had planned to hide out in the woods, but he had left his\nbackpack and shotgun behind in the Holstons\u2019 house, so he drove to a store. With\ncash stolen from the Holstons, he bought new clothes to replace his bloodstained\nones.\n        {\u00b6 25} While driving the truck, Lawson was pursued by police; he\nabandoned the truck and fled on foot. Eventually, he reached a wooded area, where\nhe spent the next two nights. Lawson later said that after one \u201ccold, cold night\u201d in\nthe woods, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have no more flight in me.\u201d Nevertheless, he did not\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemerge from the woods until the morning of October 13, when he was apprehended.\nDetectives took him to the county prosecutor\u2019s office in Ironton, where he\nconfessed to the four murders.\n       {\u00b6 26} Dr. Robert Shott, the deputy Montgomery County coroner,\nperformed autopsies on all four victims. He testified that Stacey suffered two\nshotgun wounds to the chest and one to the back, fatally injuring her heart and\nlungs. D.H. was shot twice, receiving fatal wounds to the heart, lung, and aorta.\nTammie was shot once in the neck, fatally injuring her spinal cord, and once in the\nshoulder. Donald was shot once in the shoulder and once, fatally, in the chest.\n                              B. Procedural History\n       {\u00b6 27} On October 18, 2017, the grand jury indicted Lawson on four counts\nof aggravated murder with death specifications. Count 1 charged the aggravated\nmurder of Stacey Holston with prior calculation and design, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A).      Count 1 carried three death specifications: course of conduct\ninvolving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(5); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7),\npredicated on rape.\n       {\u00b6 28} Count 2 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of D.H., a child\nunder the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(C). This count carried six death\nspecifications: course of conduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder of a\nvictim younger than 13, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9); murder to escape\ndetection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated\non kidnapping; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Count 3 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Tammie\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Count 4 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Donald\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Counts 3 and 4 both carried four death specifications: a course of\nconduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n       {\u00b6 30} The indictment also included the following noncapital counts: Count\n5, attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.02(A); Count 6,\nfelonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Count 7, aggravated burglary,\nin violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2); Count 8, rape, in violation of R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2); Count 9, abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B); Count\n10, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Count 11, tampering with\nevidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1); Count 12, theft of a motor vehicle, in\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(5); and Count 13, failure to comply with\na police officer\u2019s order, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii). Counts\n1 through 4 and Counts 7, 8, and 10 carried firearm specifications.\n       {\u00b6 31} On February 21, 2019, the state voluntarily dismissed the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8) specifications that were attached to Counts 2, 3, and 4. Lawson then\nentered pleas of guilty to all remaining counts and specifications before the three-\njudge panel. Over the next few days, the three-judge panel heard witness testimony\nas required by R.C. 2945.06 and on February 25, 2019, unanimously found Lawson\nguilty of all counts of the indictment except Count 8 (rape) and of all specifications\nexcept the specification for felony murder predicated on rape that was attached to\nCount 1 (aggravated murder of Stacey).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The panel then held a mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C.\n2929.03(D)(1) beginning on February 26, 2019. After hearing the evidence that\nLawson offered in mitigation, the panel sentenced him to death on all four counts\nof aggravated murder. He also received sentences totaling 59 years and six months\non the noncapital counts and specifications. Lawson appeals of right and we now\naddress his propositions of law.\n      II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY\n                                     HEARING\n       {\u00b6 33} Lawson initially pleaded not guilty to the indictment. More than a\nyear later, he changed his mind, waived a jury trial, and entered guilty pleas to each\ncount of the indictment and to all the death specifications (except the three that the\nstate voluntarily dismissed). In so doing, he acted against his trial counsel\u2019s advice.\n       {\u00b6 34} Defense counsel never requested a hearing into Lawson\u2019s\ncompetence to stand trial. Nevertheless, in his first proposition of law, Lawson\ncontends that the trial court had a constitutional duty to inquire into his competence\nto stand trial before accepting his change of plea.\n                                 A. Relevant Facts\n       {\u00b6 35} On February 11, 2019, several days into the jury-selection process,\ndefense counsel informed the trial court that Lawson did not want a trial. In\nchambers, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys explained that Lawson did not want to put\nhimself, his family, and the families of the victims through a full trial \u201cwith all of\nthe gruesome photos that would be presented [and] all of the things that would be\n* * * said about him.\u201d Counsel said that he had explained to Lawson that if he\nentered a guilty plea, the case would proceed before a three-judge panel, not a jury.\n       {\u00b6 36} Defense counsel then observed:\n\n\n       I suppose * * * if he wants to do that, there\u2019s always a question of\n       whether or not there needs to be an examination of his competence\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        to waive jury in a capital case. Obviously that\u2019s not something that\n        we can [determine] today. And it may be something that would\n        require a psychological evaluation, although in a capital case, I\n        would ask for an independent one rather than what we would do in\n        a typical case.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 37} One of the prosecutors noted that the defense team included a\npsychologist, Dr. Bob Stinson, and asked whether Dr. Stinson could render an\nopinion on Lawson\u2019s competence. Defense counsel replied that he could not\n\u201ccommit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that,\u201d because a competency assessment is\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d from a mitigation assessment.        Nevertheless, defense\ncounsel noted that Dr. Stinson \u201c[o]bviously * * * would have more familiarity with\n[Lawson] than anyone else\u201d and stated that he \u201cassume[d] that it could be done in\na manner\u201d; he also stated that he had not \u201cthought through whether that would\ncreate some sort of a conflict in terms of what [Dr. Stinson\u2019s] testimony would be\nin the mitigation phase.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 38} The trial judge then stated that he had \u201cbrought this up months ago\non the potential for a competency evaluation\u201d but that he had declined to order one\nbecause the defense had opposed it. (Any previous discussions of competency\nissues must have occurred off the record, as the transcript does not reflect any\ndiscussion of a competency evaluation before February 11.) The trial judge\ncontinued, \u201cI\u2019m now second-guessing myself that I should have [ordered] it over\nobjection.\u201d       Defense counsel remarked that the court was \u201cnot incorrect\u201d in\ndeclining to order an evaluation over the defense\u2019s opposition. The prosecutor\npointed out that the defense had not raised a question about Lawson\u2019s competence\nto stand trial.\n        {\u00b6 39} At the request of defense counsel, the court took a recess so that\nLawson could discuss the matter with his family. When the session resumed,\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefense counsel told the court at a bench conference that \u201cafter much thought,\nconsideration, [and] discussion with family members and counsel,\u201d Lawson had\ndecided not to change his plea and would proceed with a jury trial. The court then\nresumed the jury-selection process and the prospective jurors were brought into the\ncourtroom.\n       {\u00b6 40} The next day, however, Lawson\u2019s counsel informed the trial court\nthat Lawson had decided to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea\nto a three-judge panel. The trial court questioned Lawson at length about whether\nhe understood that he was waiving his constitutional right to have a jury hear and\ndecide the case. Lawson affirmatively stated a number of times that he understood\nthe consequences of his decision.\n       {\u00b6 41} During this exchange, the trial court asked Lawson whether he had\nconsulted with his family about his decision.          Lawson answered that after\nconsulting with his family the previous day, he \u201chad a second thought throughout\nthe night.\u201d He informed the trial court that \u201cit was a little rough because I saw my\nmom crying and it always plays on my heart. And then after a while I have to make\na better decision for my life and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 42} The trial court accepted Lawson\u2019s waiver. Lawson\u2019s counsel then\nfiled a written waiver of jury trial that Lawson had signed.

Analysis\n      a. Were there sufficient indicia of incompetence to require a hearing?\n       {\u00b6 52} Lawson acknowledges that his counsel never asked for a\ncompetency evaluation, but he contends that the trial court denied him due process\nby not ordering one sua sponte. He contends that the record in this case establishes\nsufficient \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d to require a hearing.\n       {\u00b6 53} Three facts, Lawson contends, called his competence into question.\nFirst, his decision to waive a jury trial and plead guilty to the indictment was made\nagainst the advice of his counsel. Second, he displayed \u201cindecision,\u201d in that he\nchanged his mind about pleading guilty. Third, at the time of his plea, he \u201cwas\nbeing treated with psychiatric medications,\u201d a fact he disclosed to the trial court\nduring the plea colloquy.\n       {\u00b6 54} Lawson\u2019s acting against the advice of counsel does not indicate\nincompetence. We have noted that a defendant\u2019s \u201crefusal to heed his counsel\u2019s\nadvice * * * [does] not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the\ncharges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in\nhis defense.\u201d State v.

The record shows that after first expressing his desire to plead guilty\non February 11, 2019, Lawson discussed the matter with his counsel and family\nand then decided not to change his plea. The next day, however, he filed his written\njury waiver. The record does not show that he changed his mind again. On\nFebruary 21, he still wished to plead guilty, and he did so without further hesitation.\n       {\u00b6 56} It is not surprising that a defendant contemplating entering a guilty\nplea in a capital case would display some hesitation. \u201cIndecisiveness is not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsame as incompetency[,] however.\u201d Johnson v.

However, once he distanced\nhimself from those emotions and further reflected, he knew that the best decision\nfor him was to change his not-guilty plea to a plea of guilty.\n       {\u00b6 57} In any event, Lawson\u2019s change of mind was brief. Having decided\nto plead guilty on February 12, he held to his decision in the face of his counsel\u2019s\ncontrary advice and after a rigorous plea colloquy. And he continued to hold to his\ndecision over the ensuing nine days and during the change-of-plea hearing before\nthe three-judge panel. This sequence of events has no tendency to show that\nLawson lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding, nor does it suggest that he was unable to understand the\nproceedings.\n       {\u00b6 58} Finally, Lawson cites his statement during the plea colloquy that he\nwas taking prescription medication. The presiding judge asked Lawson whether he\nwas \u201cpresently under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or mind-altering\nsubstance.\u201d Lawson replied: \u201cI\u2019m under prescription medication, but that is all.\u201d\nHe stated that he was taking naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and Zoloft.\n       {\u00b6 59} However, \u201cit is a matter of statutory and decisional law that \u2018[t]he\nfact that a defendant is taking antidepressant medication or prescribed psychotropic\ndrugs does not negate his competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">148 Ohio\nSt.3d 347</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4027840\"><a href=\"/opinion/4250579/state-v-montgomery-slip-opinion/\">2016-Ohio-5487</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">71 N.E.3d 180</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 56, quoting State v.

Did the trial court raise the issue of competency?\n       {\u00b6 66} Lawson contends that \u201cthe [trial] court itself effectively raised the\nissue\u201d of his competence\u2014presumably on February 11, 2019, when the court\nwondered out loud whether it should have ordered a competency hearing earlier in\nthe case over the defense\u2019s objections. Lawson relies on State v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 Ohio\nSt.3d 108</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">502 N.E.2d 1016</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), in which this court stated: \u201c[T]here is no\nquestion that where the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is raised\nprior to the trial, a competency hearing is mandatory.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.37(B).\nLawson\u2019s argument is not clear, but he seems to imply that a competency hearing\nwas required under Bock because the trial court itself had \u201craised\u201d the issue of\ncompetence.\n       {\u00b6 67} We disagree. While a trial court may raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency, see R.C. 2945.37(B), the trial court in this case was not exercising this\nauthority. In essence, the trial court was asking the defense whether it wanted a\ncompetency hearing. Asking the defense whether it wants a hearing does not by\nitself make a hearing mandatory. The fact that the trial court did not order a\ncompetency evaluation and hearing, when it had the authority to sua sponte do so,\nshows that the court did not intend to raise the issue of Lawson\u2019s competence.\nMoreover, even if a competency hearing were mandatory under Bock, the failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nhold one would be harmless error in this case: \u201c[I]t is clear that the failure to hold\na mandatory competency hearing is harmless error where the record fails to reveal\nsufficient indicia of incompetency.\u201d Bock at 110.\n                    4. No support for the dissent\u2019s per se rule\n        {\u00b6 68} As set forth above, the Supreme Court has established, and Ohio has\nadopted, specific procedures to adequately protect an incompetent defendant from\nbeing tried or convicted. The dissent, however, advocates for the adoption of a per\nse rule\u2014that a competency examination and hearing are required at the instant in\nwhich a capital defendant pursues an adverse-interest request, such as entering a\nplea of guilty.\n        {\u00b6 69} There is no compelling reason to adopt that per se rule. As the Fifth\nCircuit has held:\n\n\n        [W]e decline to adopt a per se rule that, as a matter of law, a trial\n        court must doubt a capital punishment defendant\u2019s competency, or\n        conclude that such defendant does not understand the proceedings\n        against him or appreciate their significance, or conclude that he\n        cannot rationally aid his attorney in his defense simply because it is\n        obvious to the court that the defendant is causing his trial to be\n        conducted in a manner most likely to result in a conviction and the\n        imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\nRoberts v.

INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        {\u00b6 93} In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance. To establish ineffective assistance, Lawson must\nshow (1) deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective\nstandard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been\ndifferent. Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">466 U.S. 668</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687-688, 694, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">104 S.Ct. 2052</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">80 L.Ed.2d 674</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984); State v.

Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation\n        {\u00b6 94} Lawson argues that his counsel should have requested a competency\nevaluation, which would have led to a competency hearing.\n        {\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.37(B) entitles the defense to a pretrial competency\nhearing upon request: \u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas, * * * the\ncourt, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to\nstand trial. If the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\nhold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense\ncounsel is not ineffective in failing to request that the trial court order a competency\nevaluation or hold a competency hearing when the defendant does not display\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. State v.\nThomas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">97 Ohio St.3d 309</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2002-Ohio-6624</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">779 N.E.2d 1017</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 96} Lawson contends that counsel\u2019s decision not to request a\ncompetency evaluation cannot be justified as a strategic decision, because\nrequesting an evaluation would have had no possible \u201cdownside.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 97} Lawson\u2019s assertion that there is no downside to requesting a\ncompetency evaluation in this type of situation is questionable: defense counsel\nmay risk straining their relationship with their client when they question his mental\ncompetence and seek to negate his decisions. But in any event, competent counsel\nwould not request an evaluation unless they had some reason to doubt the\ndefendant\u2019s competence. Here, nothing in the record shows that Lawson\u2019s counsel\nhad any such reason.\n       {\u00b6 98} Lawson contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate the\ncompetency issue before declining to request a competency evaluation. He argues\nthat an expert opinion on Lawson\u2019s competence was essential, because counsel\u2019s\n\u201carmchair opinions\u201d were not a sufficient basis on which to make such a decision.\nHe further argues that the record fails to show that defense counsel ever sought an\nexpert opinion.\n       {\u00b6 99} Lawson points to defense counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court on\nFebruary 11, 2019, the day Lawson first announced that he wanted to waive a jury\nand plead guilty. One of the prosecutors asked whether Dr. Stinson could render\nan opinion on competence based on conversations Dr. Stinson and Lawson had\nalready had. One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied:\n\n\n               I can\u2019t commit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that. I know\n       psychologists that I have worked with in the past would probably\n       say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a completely different review and assessment,\u201d\n       and they\u2019re looking for different things than the context of\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       presenting possible psychological information for purposes of\n       mitigation.\n               Obviously [Dr. Stinson] would have more familiarity with\n       this young man than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be\n       done in a manner, although I * * * haven\u2019t thought through whether\n       that would create some sort of a conflict in terms of what his\n       testimony would be in the mitigation phase.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Lawson reads this statement as indicating \u201cthe limited scope of Dr.\nStinson\u2019s services[,] which did not include a competency examination.\u201d But\ndefense counsel did not say that Dr. Stinson could not render such an assessment.\nHe said only that he could not guarantee that Dr. Stinson would be able to form an\nopinion of Lawson\u2019s competence based on the interviewing Dr. Stinson had done\nup to that point. Indeed, counsel went on to say that Dr. Stinson \u201cwould have more\nfamiliarity with [Lawson] than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be done\nin a manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n       {\u00b6 101} Lawson goes on to assert that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that\nindicates that Dr. Stinson or any other mental health professional did, or was even\nasked to do, a competency evaluation on\u201d Lawson. Lawson\u2019s argument misplaces\nthe burden of persuasion: a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal must show from the record that the elements of the claim\nexist. Therefore, Lawson must show that his counsel failed to perform an adequate\ninvestigation of his possible incompetence. See, e.g., State v. Were, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">118 Ohio St.3d\n448</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2008-Ohio-2762</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">890 N.E.2d 263</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 244.\n       {\u00b6 102} Lawson also ignores what defense counsel said during the plea\nhearing on February 21. During that hearing, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys expressly\nstated that counsel had conducted an investigation into competency issues and that\nthey had consulted Dr. Stinson:\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n               JUDGE BALLARD: * * * [A]t any point did you ever have\n       any concerns that might be raised by Adkins [sic, Atkins v.

MCVAY [defense counsel]: Not being a psychologist\n       or a psychiatrist * * * I\u2019m not in a position * * * to technically\n       answer that. But based on my many years of experience and 24\n       years as a practicing attorney handling a substantial number of death\n       penalty cases * * * and having had clients who would be Adkins-\n       qualified or otherwise incompetent to enter a plea, * * * I have no\n       reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of those\n       categories at this point in time based upon my discussions with him\n       and many hours spent with him, over 17 months, as well as the time\n       spent with him today.\n\n\n(Capitalization sic.)\n       {\u00b6 103} The presiding judge then asked counsel: \u201c[I]s it safe for this panel\nto assume that you conducted appropriate investigation from your practice into any\nissue that would be addressed by Adkins or mental issues or competency issues?\u201d\nCounsel replied:\n\n\n               We did, your Honor. In keeping with the American Bar\n       Association Guidelines for the Representation of Defendants\n       Charged with Capital Crimes and their recommendation, if not\n       insistence, that we engage a forensic psychologist to work with and\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       examine the defendant in the course of our representation, * * * that\n       in fact has been done. * * *\n               Having said that, and having discussed matters with * * *\n       Dr. Stinson at length, I think I can fairly represent that by virtue of\n       the fact that we have not filed any pleadings pertaining to a possible\n       incompetency to proceed in this matter * * *, I feel that we\u2019re on\n       safe ground in that respect in the sense that we have done our due\n       diligence with regard to that * * *. We have looked into all of those\n       matters, discussed most, * * * I would suggest all of those matters\n       with Mr. Lawson. I believe that we\u2019re on solid ground to move\n       forward with what his intentions are at this point in time.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) This statement indicates that Dr. Stinson examined Lawson and\nthat defense counsel consulted Dr. Stinson in determining whether to further pursue\nthe issue of Lawson\u2019s competence. Lawson cites nothing in the record that either\ncontradicts counsel\u2019s representations or shows that the investigation that had been\nconducted was deficient.\n       {\u00b6 104} Finally, Lawson is unable to show prejudice resulting from\ncounsel\u2019s declining to request a competency evaluation. It is true that if Lawson\u2019s\ncounsel had requested an evaluation, the trial court would have been required by\nstatute to order one.   But that says nothing about the likely outcome of the\nevaluation and of the hearing. To show prejudice, Lawson must show that there is\na reasonable probability that an evaluation \u201cwould have revealed that he was\nincompetent to stand trial,\u201d Alexander v. Dugger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">841 F.2d 371</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (11th\nCir.1988).\n       {\u00b6 105} As we concluded in relation to Lawson\u2019s first proposition of law,\nthe record simply contains insufficient indicia of incompetence to require a\ncompetency evaluation or a competency hearing. If defense counsel had requested\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\na competency evaluation, the trial court would have had to hold a hearing. But the\nalleged indicia of incompetence that Lawson repeatedly cites would have been\ninsufficient to overcome the legal presumption of competence, because they do not\nsuggest that Lawson was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the\nproceedings against him or of assisting in his own defense. The record of the\npenalty phase contains numerous references to Lawson\u2019s mental-health history,\nincluding diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, and posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). However, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere\nmental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be\nemotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the\ncharges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 110, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">502\nN.E.2d 1016</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Accordingly, the record does not show a reasonable likelihood that\nthe trial court would have found Lawson incompetent to stand trial.\n              B. Failure to Argue Mercy As a Mitigating Factor\n       {\u00b6 106} In another part of his third proposition of law, Lawson contends\nthat his counsel were ineffective because they failed to renew a pretrial motion to\ninstruct the jury on mercy as a mitigating factor and because they did not argue\nduring the penalty phase that mercy was a mitigating factor.\n       {\u00b6 107} As the state points out, any issues concerning jury instructions\nbecame moot once Lawson waived a jury trial. However, Lawson also contends\nthat counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue before the three-\njudge panel that mercy is a mitigating factor. That facet of his claim is obviously\nnot rendered moot by Lawson\u2019s jury waiver.\n       {\u00b6 108} However, the claim lacks merit, as we have repeatedly held that\nmercy is not a mitigating factor. See, e.g., State v. Belton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">149 Ohio St.3d 165</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3195810\"><a href=\"/opinion/3195916/state-v-belton-slip-opinion/\">2016-Ohio-1581</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">74 N.E.3d 319</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 88; State v.

Hence, counsel did not perform deficiently by\ndeclining to argue otherwise.     \u201cDefense counsel is not required to advance\n\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\narguments lacking merit. * * * It is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to\nmaneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested or rejected legal\ntheories.\u201d State v. McNeill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">83 Ohio St.3d 438</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">700 N.E.2d 596</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).\n       {\u00b6 109} Lawson also fails to show prejudice. Defense counsel in this case\npresented extensive mitigating evidence focused on Lawson\u2019s dysfunctional family\nand upbringing, his alleged abuse, traumatic events in his life, and his diagnosed\nmental disorders. Their penalty-phase arguments to the panel concentrated on that\nevidence. Lawson does not explain how adding an express plea for mercy would\nhave been reasonably likely to make a difference in the penalty-phase outcome.\n       {\u00b6 110} We overrule Lawson\u2019s third proposition of law.\n                          V. SENTENCING OPINION\n       {\u00b6 111} In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the\npanel\u2019s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends\nthat the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against\nhim and improperly discounted the mitigating factors. We disagree.\n                 A. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s 12-page sentencing opinion begins with a\nstatement of facts. According to Lawson, the opinion includes several facts that\n\u201cmade the crime particularly disturbing\u201d and could only \u201cbe termed as\ninflammatory.\u201d Lawson contends that by mentioning these facts in the opinion, the\npanel \u201cemployed\u201d them as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\n       {\u00b6 113} The \u201cinflammatory\u201d facts Lawson refers to include the following:\nthat Lawson had sexual intercourse with Stacey\u2019s body after shooting her, that\nStacey had recently ended a sexual relationship with Lawson, that Lawson posed\nas D.H.\u2019s father to deceive D.H.\u2019s school into sending him home that day, that\nLawson \u201ctricked\u201d D.H. into entering the bedroom and shot him twice at close range,\nthat Lawson prepared in advance for the murders by propping a window open the\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nnight before, that he moved and covered the bodies, and that he was arrested two\ndays later \u201c[a]fter a manhunt.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 114} But a trial court does not \u201ccreate nonstatutory aggravating\ncircumstances\u201d merely by \u201cdiscussing the facts of the crime.\u201d State v. Robb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">88\nOhio St.3d 59</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">723 N.E.2d 1019</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). Moreover, the sentencing opinion here\ncorrectly identified the aggravating circumstances of which Lawson was found\nguilty as to each aggravated-murder count. When a trial court has correctly\nidentified the statutory aggravating circumstances pleaded and proved at trial, we\npresume that the trial court understood the difference between statutory aggravating\ncircumstances and the facts that describe the nature and circumstances of the\noffense. State v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">151 Ohio St.3d 470</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4202918\"><a href=\"/opinion/4425665/state-v-martin-slip-opinion/\">2017-Ohio-7556</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">90 N.E.3d 857</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\u00b6 137.\n         {\u00b6 115} Lawson points to nothing in the opinion that suggests that the panel\nused the facts as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Instead, he contends that\nthe opinion fails to affirmatively state that the facts were not so used, and he argues\nthat this failure suffices to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only\nthe aggravating circumstances to which Lawson pleaded guilty. However, the\nopinion does specifically state that the panel did not consider Lawson\u2019s alleged\naffair with Stacey or the other \u201coffenses charged in the indictment,\u201d which would\ninclude his abuse of Stacey\u2019s corpse, as aggravating circumstances.\n         {\u00b6 116} Lawson\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our precedent.             The\nopinion \u201cidentified only the applicable statutory aggravating circumstances * * *\nand listed no improper nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.

INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW\n       {\u00b6 126} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Lawson\u2019s\ndeath sentences. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine (1) whether the\nevidence supports the trier of fact\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, (2)\nwhether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty\noutweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) whether the\ndeath sentences are proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.\n                        A. Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 127} The aggravated murder of Stacey Holston (Count 1) has two\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)), and a felony-\nmurder circumstance predicated on aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)).\n       {\u00b6 128} The aggravated murder of D.H. (Count 2) has five aggravating\ncircumstances: murder of a victim under age 13 (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)); murder\ncommitted to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another\noffense (R.C 2929.04(A)(3)); course of conduct; felony murder predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder predicated on kidnapping.\n       {\u00b6 129} The aggravated murder of Tammie McGuire (Count 3) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 130} The aggravated murder of Donald McGuire (Count 4) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 131} The evidence in the record, including Lawson\u2019s confession,\nsupports the panel\u2019s finding as to each of the aggravating circumstances.\n                              B. Mitigating Factors\n       {\u00b6 132} Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh any of the\nrelevant mitigating factors provided in R.C. 2929.04(B). These factors include\n\u2022      the nature and circumstances of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      the history, character, and background of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it, R.C.\n       2929.04(B)(1),\n\u2022      whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for\n       the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation,\n       R.C. 2929.04(B)(2),\n\u2022      whether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a\n       mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the\n       criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct\n       to the requirements of the law, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3),\n\u2022      the youth of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4),\n\u2022      the offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and\n       delinquency adjudications, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5),\n\u2022      if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\n       the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim,\n          R.C. 2929.04(B)(6),\n\u2022         and any other factors that are relevant to the issue whether the offender\n          should be sentenced to death, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\n                                         1. Age\n          {\u00b6 133} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), \u201c[t]he youth of the offender\u201d is a\nmitigating factor. Lawson was born in 1994 and was 23 years old when he\ncommitted these murders. Lawson\u2019s age \u201cqualifies as a mitigating factor under\nR.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\u201d State v.

Dr. Stinson testified that the human brain\ncontinues to develop until a person reaches his mid-20s. He specifically noted that\nthe frontal lobe\u2014which is responsible for things like judgment, reasoning, impulse\ncontrol, and planning\u2014is the last part of the brain to develop and does not reach\nfull development until the mid-20s.\n                                2. Prior Criminal History\n          {\u00b6 135} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), \u201c[t]he offender\u2019s lack of a significant\nhistory of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications\u201d is a mitigating\nfactor.    The trial court found that Lawson has no previous convictions or\ndelinquency adjudications.\n                             3. Mental Disease or Defect\n          {\u00b6 136} The diminished-capacity mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), is\ninapplicable. Although Lawson has been diagnosed with various mental disorders,\nincluding bipolar disorder, Dr. Stinson did not testify that any of them deprived him\nof \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform\n[his] conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(3).

History, Character, and Background\n       {\u00b6 137} Lawson\u2019s history, character, and background constituted the heart\nof his case in mitigation. In the penalty phase, Lawson presented three witnesses:\nCarolyn Taylor, Stephanie Bentley, and Dr. Stinson. Carolyn Taylor is Lawson\u2019s\nmother. Stephanie Bentley is his half-sister and Carolyn\u2019s daughter. Dr. Stinson\ninterviewed Lawson for a total of 12 hours during four sessions and also\ninterviewed Lawson\u2019s mother. He reviewed information obtained by a mitigation\nspecialist who had conducted interviews of Lawson, his mother, his stepmother\nMartha Lawson, his half-sisters Stephanie Bentley and Summer Riesner, and others\nfamiliar with Lawson and his family. Dr. Stinson reviewed children\u2019s services,\neducational, employment, medical, mental-health, and jail records pertaining to\nLawson, records pertaining to Carolyn Taylor\u2019s family background and upbringing,\nand other records.\n       {\u00b6 138} Dr. Stinson identified 11 \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d\n(\u201cACEs\u201d) that place a child at risk for adverse health, mental-health, and social\noutcomes. They are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical\nneglect, emotional neglect, \u201cintimate partner violence,\u201d violence against the\nmother, \u201csubstance misuse in the household,\u201d parental divorce or separation,\nmental illness of a household member, and the incarceration of a household\nmember. Dr. Stinson testified that a research study conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention found that ACEs relate to approximately 40\nnegative outcomes. The presence of four or five ACEs indicates \u201csignificantly\nincreased risk for negative outcomes,\u201d and the likelihood of negative outcomes\nrises with the number of ACEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 139} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson had experienced \u201cat least\u201d nine\nACEs. The only two Dr. Stinson failed to definitively find were sexual abuse and\nphysical neglect.\n         {\u00b6 140} Lawson was born in April 1994. His parents are Delbert \u201cRay\u201d\nLawson and Carolyn Taylor. He was the third of five children Carolyn had by five\ndifferent men. Both of Lawson\u2019s parents have been divorced and remarried\nmultiple times. Carolyn has lived on welfare, food stamps, and Social Security\ndisability benefits.\n         {\u00b6 141} Ray and Carolyn lived together for about a month; when Carolyn\nbecame pregnant with Lawson, Ray left her. Carolyn lost custody of Lawson in\n1995. Ray denied his paternity until a DNA test proved that he was Lawson\u2019s\nfather; after that, he sought and was awarded custody of Lawson. According to Dr.\nStinson, Martha Lawson recalled that Carolyn had dropped Lawson off at Ray and\nMartha\u2019s house coatless in the middle of a winter night with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nturn.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 142} Lawson lived with Ray and Martha until he was 16. Also living in\nthe Lawson household were Ray and Martha\u2019s son Ray Jr. and Martha\u2019s son James\nMunyon. Carolyn was entitled to visitation with Lawson on Wednesdays and\nalternate weekends.    However, she testified that sometimes Ray and Martha\ndeprived Lawson of a visit as a punishment.\n         {\u00b6 143} While living with Ray and Martha, Lawson was especially close to\nhis paternal aunt, Linda McFann. Carolyn testified that Linda was \u201clike a second\nmom\u201d to him. Unfortunately, Linda died in a house fire. Carolyn testified that\nLawson was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Linda\u2019s death. Dr. Stinson testified that Linda died\nin 2006, when Lawson was about 12 years old. According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson\nstill had not \u201cresolved\u201d his bereavement five years later. At that time, a neighbor\ntold Lawson that he was glad Linda was dead, and Lawson responded by\n\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthreatening the neighbor with a butcher knife. Lawson was hospitalized at a\nmental-health facility after this incident.\n        {\u00b6 144} Lawson was also quite close to the boyfriend of one of his aunts,\nwhom he called \u201cUncle Tracy.\u201d Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Tracy was the most\npositive influence in his life. But Tracy died of a heroin overdose in about 2016.\n        {\u00b6 145} When Lawson was 16, Ray and Martha divorced, and Ray moved\nto Kentucky, leaving his children behind. Custody of Lawson then reverted to\nCarolyn, who had married Carl Kelly. A few months later, Carolyn and Kelly broke\nup, but Lawson continued to live with Kelly, whom Bentley described as like a\nfather to Lawson. Dr. Stinson believed that Kelly was generally a positive influence\non Lawson and may have provided \u201csome positive role modeling.\u201d On the other\nhand, Bentley testified that Kelly sold a lot of marijuana and provided some of it to\nLawson. After moving out, Carolyn maintained contact with Lawson, seeing him\nevery few days and talking to him on the phone.\n        {\u00b6 146} Dr. Stinson described the \u201ccomplicated family structure\u201d within\nwhich Lawson was raised. Ray left Lawson\u2019s mother to marry Martha, and\nLawson\u2019s mother had a relationship with Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon, who was\nthe father of Lawson\u2019s half-sister Stephanie Bentley. Lawson was teased in school\nbecause of this \u201cweird\u201d family situation. Additionally, Lawson\u2019s grandfather\nfathered a child with one of his daughters-in-law (Lawson\u2019s aunt by marriage); that\nchild was referred to as Lawson\u2019s \u201cUncle Cuz\u201d because he was both uncle and\ncousin to Lawson.\n        {\u00b6 147} Since at least age 11, Lawson has repeatedly alleged that his father,\nstepmother, and other family members abused him. He described his father as an\n\u201cabusive asshole\u201d who would get drunk and punch him.\n        {\u00b6 148} Carolyn testified that during visitations, she sometimes saw\nunexplained injuries on Lawson. Once she saw stitches in his head. She said that\nsomeone once squeezed Lawson\u2019s ears so tightly that they were severely bruised\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand had turned black. Bentley remembered seeing this as well, but she never saw\nany other bruising or injures. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Martha would pinch his\nears to the point of bruising and would strike him in the face.\n       {\u00b6 149} On one occasion, Carolyn testified, a dark orange substance was\ndraining from Lawson\u2019s ear. Carolyn recalled that when she took Lawson to a\ndoctor to treat his ear, the doctor said that it looked as if someone had jabbed the\nmetal end of a pencil into Lawson\u2019s ear after removing the eraser.\n       {\u00b6 150} Dr. Stinson testified that according to the medical records he\nreviewed, there were two cases of drainage from Lawson\u2019s ears. The first instance\nof \u201cbloody drainage\u201d occurred when Lawson was three; almost a year later, Lawson\nexperienced the orange discharge that had been described by Carolyn from the same\near.   According to Dr. Stinson, medical records documented that Lawson\u2019s\nstepbrother, James Munyon, had shoved pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears; however, Dr.\nStinson did not make clear whether this behavior had caused the discharges.\n       {\u00b6 151} Dr. Stinson admitted that to his knowledge, no specific instances of\nabuse against Lawson had ever been substantiated. And although Dr. Stinson\nbelieved that Lawson was a victim of abuse, he eventually conceded that he did not\nknow whether Lawson had been abused. (Dr. Stinson did not classify the alleged\ninsertion of pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears as a type of \u201cabuse.\u201d)\n       {\u00b6 152} Dr. Stinson also testified that Lawson reported abuse \u201cover and\nover and over to people who did nothing.\u201d Dr. Stinson felt that the fact that\nLawson\u2019s claims went unheeded was actually \u201cmore relevant\u201d than whether he\nactually was abused, because it contributed to his feelings of being unloved:\n\n\n       We can look back on it and say \u201cWell, it * * * really wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n       From my standpoint what\u2019s more relevant is the fact that once he\n       reported his abuse, nobody did anything about it * * * and he\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       internalized [the belief that] nobody cares, nobody\u2019s going to protect\n       me, nobody loves me and I\u2019m unlovable.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 153} Lawson did tell his mother that he was being abused, and his\nmedical records showed that he reported past abuse to medical-health professionals\nduring his treatment sessions.\n       {\u00b6 154} However, when Lawson first alleged to authorities that he was\nbeing abused, the authorities did not ignore it; they investigated and found no\nevidence to support the claim. The penalty-phase evidence includes records for\nLawson and his family from the Lawrence County Department of Job and Family\nServices that were admitted as a court\u2019s exhibit. Those records include a children\u2019s\nservices report showing that Ray and Martha were investigated in 2006 after\nLawson reported to the Ironton police that he was being abused.\n       {\u00b6 155} According to the records, Lawson alleged that his stepmother\nslapped his face, his siblings \u201cput erasers in his ears,\u201d and his parents \u201chit him\neverywhere.\u201d But the investigator found only one small bruise on Lawson\u2019s knee,\nand that appeared to the investigator to be normal for a preteen child and to not\nhave been deliberately inflicted.\n       {\u00b6 156} The investigator learned that Lawson\u2019s father had recently spanked\nhim with a belt; however, the spanking was inflicted as a punishment after Lawson\nchoked his brother, Ray Jr., during a squabble. Martha told the investigator that\nLawson had expressed a desire \u201cto get his father in trouble like he was in trouble\nfrom choking\u201d his brother.\n       {\u00b6 157} Although Lawson has never reported that he was sexually abused\nand in fact has denied it, Dr. Stinson nonetheless suspected that Lawson may have\nbeen sexually abused as a child. He based this suspicion on the existence of\n\u201crampant\u201d sexual abuse in Lawson\u2019s family over the years. Carolyn\u2019s oldest son\nwas allegedly sexually abused and went on to abuse two sisters and a cousin.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLawson\u2019s stepbrother was sexually abused by a neighbor. One of Lawson\u2019s half-\nsisters was sexually abused by Carolyn\u2019s brother-in-law. A generation before,\nCarolyn\u2019s family members had been involved in numerous allegations of sexual\nabuse. Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson may have denied being sexually abused\nbecause it was so common as to become \u201cnormalized\u201d in his family.\n       {\u00b6 158} Lawson\u2019s mother, Carolyn Taylor, was raised in poverty; her\nfamily was dependent on welfare and food stamps, and the children were\nmalnourished. Carolyn grew up in a trailer that housed 12 people. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that \u201cthere were concerns that the boys and the girls were sharing bedrooms\nand sleeping together.\u201d The home was leaky and roach-infested and had no indoor\nbathroom.\n       {\u00b6 159} During Carolyn\u2019s childhood, numerous allegations of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were leveled against her parents and stepparents;\nmany of them were against her father in particular.             Children\u2019s services\ninvestigators were able to substantiate some of these allegations, but according to\nDr. Stinson, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, Dr. Stinson\ntestified that the \u201cremarkable\u201d number of allegations said a great deal about the\nculture of Carolyn\u2019s family.\n       {\u00b6 160} Dr. Stinson also stated that Carolyn suffered from \u201csignificant\nmental health problems.\u201d Documented symptoms he listed included agitation,\nanhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities), anxiety, crying spells,\ndisorganized thought, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, homicidal and\nsuicidal thoughts, hyperactivity, paranoia, panic attacks, phobic avoidance,\npreoccupation, self-mutilation, and feelings of worthlessness.          Her \u201cmood\ndisturbance\u201d manifested itself in the forms of severe depression, anger, euphoria,\nirritability, mania, and \u201cmixed moods,\u201d i.e., simultaneous symptoms of depression\nand mania.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 161} Dr. Stinson related that Carolyn had been diagnosed with anxiety\ndisorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, \u201cmoderate and recurrent\u201d major depressive\ndisorder, various forms of bipolar disorder including \u201cmixed [simultaneously manic\nand depressive] severe, with psychotic features,\u201d and schizoaffective disorder, a\npsychotic disorder combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She had been\ntreated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. Carolyn\u2019s\ndoctor had determined that her mental disorders left her \u201cfunctionally impaired,\u201d\nunable to carry on day-to-day activities. The Social Security Administration had\nfound that she was \u201cpermanently impaired and unable to engage in any gainful\nactivity.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 162} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson also had three relatives\u2014an\nuncle, aunt, and great-uncle\u2014who had attempted suicide. And Lawson described\na maternal half-brother as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and as having delusions. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that severe mental-health problems have a genetic component, so that the\nchildren of parents with severe mental-health problems are particularly at risk to\ninherit them.\n        {\u00b6 163} Lawson has in fact had mental-health problems and has been\ndiagnosed with mental disorders since childhood. Most significantly, in March\n2011, shortly before he turned 17, Lawson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and\nbipolar disorder. In April of that year, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at\nMercy Franciscan Hospital after a violent incident with his neighbor. Hospital staff\nmembers believed that past abuse had contributed to his emotional difficulties.\n        {\u00b6 164} Lawson continued to receive mental-health evaluations and\ntreatment in 2011 and 2012. During one psychiatric examination, he said he was\nhaving flashbacks to past abuse. In 2012, Lawson was hospitalized again because\nhe was contemplating injuring his neighbor.\n        {\u00b6 165} Since 2011, Lawson has been diagnosed repeatedly with depressive\ndisorder and PTSD. Dr. Stinson testified that when he interviewed Lawson, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nexhibited classic symptoms of depression and PTSD.                 Despite previous\nhospitalizations, Dr. Stinson testified, Lawson did not receive the kind of treatment\nhe needed.\n        {\u00b6 166} Lawson has had anger issues dating back to his childhood. During\nthe 2006 children\u2019s services investigation, the investigating social worker wrote\nthat she was concerned about Lawson\u2019s inability to control his anger. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that Lawson was enrolled in an anger-management class at age 13 because\nhe was unable to regulate his emotions; however, his stepmother removed him\nbecause the class took time away from his chores and homework. At age 16, he\nwas diagnosed with \u201canger disorder.\u201d Dr. Stinson noted that \u201cthere is no such thing\nas anger disorder,\u201d but he interpreted this diagnosis to mean that Lawson had a\nmood disorder in which anger was predominant.\n        {\u00b6 167} A consistent factor in Lawson\u2019s personality has been his repeatedly\nexpressed feelings that he was worthless; he described himself to Dr. Stinson as\nfeeling like \u201cjust a piece of crap\u201d and \u201clike a dog.\u201d Schoolmates made fun of his\nfamily and his first name. (His mother meant to name him \u201cAaron,\u201d but she\nmisspelled it as \u201cArron\u201d on his birth certificate. His preferred pronunciation is \u201cAr-\nron,\u201d with the emphasis on the second syllable, but people frequently mispronounce\nit.)   Bentley testified that Martha favored her own children over Lawson.\nAccording to Dr. Stinson, Lawson used marijuana to deal with feelings of\nemptiness and worthlessness.\n        {\u00b6 168} Lawson\u2019s family has an extensive history of drug and alcohol\nproblems. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that his father, Ray, was \u201cdrunk all the time.\u201d\nBentley testified that Ray drank \u201c[e]very day, all day long.\u201d Carolyn told Dr.\nStinson that Ray was \u201ca real bad drunk.\u201d During the period when Lawson lived\nwith Ray and Martha, Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon was released from prison and\nmoved into the household. Dr. Stinson testified that Munyon not only smoked\nmarijuana but traded it for sex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Despite Lawson\u2019s family history, Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson\nhimself did not have \u201csevere drug and alcohol problems.\u201d But Dr. Stinson stated\nthat Lawson did use marijuana and other drugs to cope with physical pain and\nemotional distress. Bentley testified that Lawson smoked marijuana frequently or\ndaily. Dr. Stinson diagnosed Lawson with a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d but he\nconceded that this disorder caused no major impairment of Lawson\u2019s functioning.\nThere was no evidence that Lawson had been using alcohol or drugs at the time of\nthe aggravated murders in this case.\n       {\u00b6 170} Lawson had numerous medical problems throughout his life.\nWhen he was two, a dog bit him on the cheek, although Carolyn testified that the\ninjury was not serious. At the age of three, he had a laceration to the forehead,\nrequiring stitches, and had skin-cancer surgery. At the age of four, his tongue was\nclipped twice to correct a speech impediment. Both the skin-cancer surgery and\nthe tongue clipping were outpatient procedures. At the age of 12, while playing\nwith his siblings, he was shot in one eye with an \u201cairsoft\u201d gun (similar to a BB gun,\nbut firing plastic or rubber pellets), causing temporary blindness in that eye. Dr.\nStinson testified that Lawson has continued to have \u201cvision problems\u201d since that\ninjury. In addition, Lawson\u2019s gallbladder was removed in 2010.\n       {\u00b6 171} In 2011, Lawson suffered multiple medical problems. Severe\nheadaches required several doctor and hospital visits.        He also experienced\ndegenerative disc disease, abdominal pain, and \u201cabnormal findings related to his\ncolon and appendix.\u201d In 2017, Lawson was in a \u201cfender-bender\u201d accident and\nstruck his head on a rear-view mirror. While he did not seek medical attention at\nthe time, he experienced chronic headaches after the accident.\n       {\u00b6 172} In addition to the above factors, Lawson expressed remorse for the\nmurders in his confession and in his unsworn statement. He told the panel, \u201cI know\nwhat I did was wrong\u201d and stated that he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for what he did. He\napologized to everyone he had harmed, including the four murder victims and his\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nown family. He said that he cannot sleep at night, cries all the time, cries himself\nto sleep, and has flashbacks. He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t expect sympathy. * * * If it\nbe death penalty, then I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m at peace with whatever you give me.\u201d\nLawson also expressed his remorse to Dr. Stinson, who felt that Lawson\u2019s remorse\nwas sincere.\n       {\u00b6 173} Dr. Stinson testified about Lawson\u2019s conduct in the Morrow\nCounty jail, where he was held pending trial. A jail supervisor described Lawson\nto Dr. Stinson as trustworthy, well behaved, respectful, and \u201cnot * * * a problem.\u201d\nOther correctional officers consistently told Dr. Stinson that Lawson was not\ncausing any problems.      Whenever Dr. Stinson saw Lawson interacting with\nofficers, they seemed to have a tension-free and professional relationship. On one\noccasion, Lawson gave jail staff members advance warning that several other\ninmates were planning to disrupt jail operations by flooding their toilets.\n       {\u00b6 174} Lawson\u2019s jail records showed two \u201cwrite-ups\u201d in the approximately\n16 months he was there. In January 2018, he got upset about a lockdown, kicked a\ndoor, and threatened an officer; he lost all privileges as a result. Dr. Stinson\ndescribed the other incident as \u201cequivocal.\u201d A Lawrence County deputy sheriff\nwho was transporting Lawson accused him of resisting him and of disrespect and\ndisobedience; however, a Morrow County deputy stated that there had been no\nproblem. Lawson was not disciplined for this incident. Overall, Dr. Stinson opined\nthat when compared to other inmates he had worked with, Lawson had adjusted to\nincarceration \u201crelatively\u201d well, even \u201cremarkably well.\u201d\n                   5. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n       {\u00b6 175} The trial court gleaned one mitigating factor from the\ncircumstances of the offense: while in the Holstons\u2019 house on the day of the\nmurders, Lawson fed two-year-old B.H., changed his diaper, and put him down for\na nap. Beyond that, nothing about the nature and circumstances of the offenses in\nthis case could be considered mitigating.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                     C. Weighing\n          {\u00b6 176} We must determine whether the aggravating circumstances that\nwere found by the three-judge panel outweigh the mitigating factors presented in\nthis case beyond a reasonable doubt.

See R.C.\n2929.04(B)(4). This court has frequently upheld death sentences for 23-year-old\nmurderers and has ordinarily given the (B)(4) factor little weight in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Conway, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">108 Ohio St.3d 214</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2006-Ohio-791</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">842 N.E.2d 996</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 195\n(\u201clittle weight\u201d); State v.

Graham had just turned 19 at\nthe time he committed aggravated murder, a little more than one year removed from\nthe minimum age for death-penalty eligibility. In contrast, Lawson was 23 when\nhe committed the murders at issue here, a more significant passage of time from\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe minimum age of eligibility. Therefore, we consider Lawson\u2019s youth to be a\nfactor that carries some weight.\n       {\u00b6 179} The evidence that Lawson was abused is not conclusive. The\nrecord does show, however, that Lawson experienced a degree of instability in his\nupbringing, with several changes in custody and living arrangements. The evidence\nalso shows that he was surrounded by poor role models and had few good role\nmodels and that he felt unloved and worthless.\n       {\u00b6 180} Because Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the four\naggravated murders in this case, he had at least some \u201ctime to distance himself from\nhis childhood and allow other factors to assert themselves in his personality and his\nbehavior,\u201d State v.

In this case,\nLawson did surrender\u2014although that decision may have been influenced by a cold\nnight in the woods without supplies, shelter, or weapons. More importantly,\nLawson gave a complete, truthful confession that aided the police with their crime-\nscene investigation. Therefore, we find that Lawson\u2019s remorse and cooperation are\nentitled to some weight in mitigation. His generally good conduct in jail is also\nentitled to some weight.\n       {\u00b6 183} With respect to D.H.\u2019s murder, the aggravating circumstances\ninclude that Lawson engaged in a course of conduct\u2014i.e., committed multiple\nmurders\u2014and the fact that D.H. was younger than 13. \u201cIn particular, the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it\ninvolves the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d State v.

In addition, the murders of Stacey\u2019s parents have the escaping-\ndetection circumstance.\n       {\u00b6 185} Two recent cases in which we have found that aggravation did not\noutweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, Johnson and Graham, each\ninvolved 19-year-old defendants, both of whom \u201centered a residence to commit\nrobbery and killed a [single] person inside.\u201d Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 Ohio St.3d 187</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2020-\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio-6700, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">172 N.E.3d 841</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 215. By contrast, Lawson was 23 years old; he\nentered the Holstons\u2019 residence and lay in wait specifically to kill; over a period of\n12 hours, he killed four people, one an eight-year-old child who should not even\nhave been in the house, and he attempted to kill a fifth.\n        {\u00b6 186} This case invites particular comparison with Graham, which it\nresembles in that both Lawson and Graham were young defendants who suffered\nfrom untreated or insufficiently treated mental-health issues and adverse\nenvironmental factors. See Graham at \u00b6 196. In fact, Lawson\u2019s mental disorders\u2014\nbipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety\u2014are more significant than\nGraham\u2019s oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n        {\u00b6 187} However, this case is distinguishable from Graham in numerous\nimportant ways. We have already noted some of the key distinctions: Lawson was\nfour years older than Graham was when the crimes were committed; Lawson killed\nfour people to Graham\u2019s one; one of Lawson\u2019s victims was eight years old and that\ninnocent victim was in the house only because of Lawson\u2019s deception; Lawson\nentered the house where the crimes occurred with the express purpose of\ncommitting murder, unlike Graham, who entered for the purpose of robbery with\nno intention to kill anyone. And the list goes on.\n        {\u00b6 188} While Graham was the principal offender in the aggravated murder\nhe committed, he \u201cwas not the mastermind,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 Ohio St.3d 187</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4643945\"><a href=\"/opinion/4840166/state-v-graham-slip-opinion/\">2020-Ohio-6700</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">172 N.E.3d 841</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 205, of the drug robbery that led to the murder; he was\nrecruited by a friend. In this case, Lawson was not just the principal offender; he\nwas the sole offender. Nobody recruited or enticed him; the whole thing was his\nidea.\n        {\u00b6 189} The murder in Graham was a quick reaction to events during the\nrobbery: Graham told the victim not to look at the robbers, the victim expressed\ndoubt that Graham would shoot him, and Graham shot him. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at \u00b6 12</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In contrast,\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nLawson planned and prepared for Stacey\u2019s murder well in advance and committed\nfour murders over a 12-hour period in which the death toll mounted.\n         {\u00b6 190} Like Lawson, Graham used marijuana daily. But unlike Lawson,\nGraham was also addicted to Xanax, using \u201cmassive\u201d daily amounts of it, Graham\nat \u00b6 199. Moreover, Graham\u2019s Xanax use made him more irritable and aggressive\nand less inhibited. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at \u00b6 199, 210</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Indeed, Graham\u2019s expert witness testified that\nit was unlikely that Graham would have committed the murder but for his Xanax\naddiction. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at \u00b6 199</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Lawson had a cannabis-use disorder, but according to Dr.\nStinson it caused no major impairment of his functioning, and there is no evidence\nthat drug use played any role in the murders in this case.\n         {\u00b6 191} This case is undeniably one in which the defendant has presented\nsignificant mitigating factors. But this is also a case in which the defendant\nslaughtered four people, including the callous slaying of an eight-year-old child.\nWith respect to each of the four aggravated murders before us, we find that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n                                D. Proportionality\n         {\u00b6 192} We further determine that the death sentences for these crimes are\nproportionate to sentences approved in similar cases.

Lawson\u2019s convictions. I reluctantly concur, however, with this\ncourt\u2019s judgment affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentence.\n       {\u00b6 195} Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder, and depression, there is no denying that Lawson suffers from serious\nmental illnesses and that he did not receive adequate treatment for these disorders.\nOf these diagnoses, bipolar disorder has been found to be a major mental illness.\nSee State v. Ketterer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">111 Ohio St.3d 70</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2006-Ohio-5283</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">855 N.E.2d 48</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 172,\n205. The majority opinion recognizes that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history was\nsubstantial and accorded it the mitigating factor entitled to the strongest weight.\nSee majority opinion at \u00b6 177. The General Assembly has also recognized the\ncritical importance of this issue, see 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, which became\neffective during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        54\n\f                                     January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 196} As of April 12, 2021, a person who has been diagnosed with a\n\u201cserious mental illness\u201d\u2014including bipolar disorder\u2014is ineligible for a death\nsentence, R.C. 2929.025(E)(1), when the defendant timely raises the issue and\nproves by a preponderance of the evidence, R.C. 2929.025(D)(1), that the illness\n\u201csignificantly impaired the person\u2019s capacity to exercise rational judgment,\u201d\n2929.025(A)(1)(b), with respect to either conforming to the law or appreciating the\nnature,     consequences,    or      wrongfulness         of   the   person\u2019s      conduct,\n2929.025(A)(1)(b)(i) and (ii). Because Lawson was sentenced before the effective\ndate of 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, he has one year after its effective date to seek\na   postconviction     remedy,       R.C.    2953.21(A)(2)(b).         See      also   R.C.\n2953.21(A)(1)(a)(iv) and 2953.21(A)(3)(a), as amended. Notwithstanding our\njudgment today, the postconviction statutes leave a door open for Lawson.\n          O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n                                  _________________\n          BRUNNER, J., dissenting.\n          {\u00b6 197} Testing the competency of persons accused of capital crimes is\ncritical to affording the degree of due process guaranteed by the Ohio and federal\nConstitutions and fulfills the proscription found in the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution against cruel and unusual punishment.

In Ohio,\nthe General Assembly has recently prohibited the imposition of the death penalty\nfor the crime of aggravated murder when the defendant had a serious mental illness\nat the time that he committed the offense. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.02(A), 2929.025,\nand other statutes enacted in 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136. This case is therefore\nabout more than whether appellant, Arron Lawson, was able to consult with his\nlawyers and reasonably understand the proceedings against him. This appeal is an\nopportunity for this court to reexamine the protections and precautions that are\ncentral to ensuring that any death sentence that is imposed is appropriate and\nsubjected to a reliable, deliberate, and rigorous constitutional review.\n       {\u00b6 199} Former Justice Paul Pfeifer stated when he served as a justice of\nthis court that \u201c[t]he death penalty should be reserved for the most severe of cases.\u201d\nState v.

It is difficult to imagine Lawson\u2019s\nhorrendous acts not falling into the category of the worst of cases. But this court is\nconstitutionally bound to not only review Lawson\u2019s sentence but also to verify the\nintegrity of the process leading to the imposition of the death penalty as the\npunishment for his crimes. This should not be a mechanistic analysis; it should be\na thorough endeavor that closely examines all aspects of the proceedings that have\nculminated in our review. Because there are too many unaddressed concerns in the\nmajority\u2019s analysis, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n   I.

Likewise, after the conclusion of the trial-court proceedings, if a\nperson who was convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death wanted to forgo\nfurther legal challenges, essentially volunteering for death, this court has required\nthat the person undergo a competency evaluation and that the trial court hold a\nhearing before such a request would be honored.

However, clear guidelines are lacking about the way\ncompetency should be questioned and examined in the stages that occur between\nthe period before the start of a trial and the final imposition of a death sentence.\nThus, trial courts have been free to apply whatever standards they choose during\nthose stages, and their decisions are not overturned on appeal unless there are\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d in the record, State v.

Indicia of incompetency in Lawson\u2019s case\n       {\u00b6 202} Lawson has raised three areas of concern that, taken together,\nshould be held to have triggered the trial court\u2019s duty to order a pretrial\nincompetency exam: when Lawson acted against the advice of his counsel by\nwaiving a trial and entering guilty pleas, when Lawson exhibited indecisiveness\nabout his decision to enter guilty pleas, and when Lawson revealed to the court that\nhe was taking prescription medications. Going against the advice of counsel, alone,\ndoes not equate with incompetence. Indecisiveness, alone, may not necessarily\nconstitute a clear indicator that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Nor may\ntaking prescription medications, standing alone, be a clear indicator of\nincompetence. Our inquiry in this appeal, however, is not whether we believe that\nLawson was competent; it is whether these factors taken together should be held to\nreasonably indicate to a trial court that further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s\ncompetency is required, to ensure the fairness of the proceeding, especially in a\ncapital case. See R.C. 2945.37(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                      January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 203} There were indicia, i.e., signs or indications, that should have\nprompted\u2014and did prompt\u2014the trial court to further inquire about concerns of\npossible \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d regarding Lawson\u2019s competency to\nwaive a trial and change his pleas. On multiple occasions, the trial court raised the\nissue of a possible competency evaluation.1 The record is clear that the presiding\ntrial judge was hesitating and \u201csecond-guessing\u201d whether the types of\nconsiderations underlying Atkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\">536 U.S. 304</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\">122 S.Ct. 2242</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\">153 L.Ed.2d 335</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nand other precedents had been observed or applied. The trial judge appeared\nhesitant about Lawson\u2019s thought process in making the grave and weighty decision\nto plead guilty in a proceeding that could carry the consequential punishment of\ndeath.\n         {\u00b6 204} Lawson\u2019s actions in waiving his right to a jury trial and entering\npleas of guilty to multiple capital offenses, combined with the trial court\u2019s\nhesitations, were indicia of incompetency that do exist in our limited record,\nconsidering that no competency examination or hearing ever occurred. It should\nnot be our role to guess from the evidence what Lawson\u2019s state of mind was and\ntherefore what his mental capabilities were.                If he had been assessed for\ncompetency, we would be able to read a report from a mental-health professional\nabout his ability and state of mind. Without that kind of evidence, it is difficult to\ndiscern from the record whether Lawson was exercising the rights of a rational,\nmentally and physically healthy person in making this decision.

The majority opinion outlines the discussions between the trial judge and counsel regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency, including an in-chambers discussion on February 11, 2019.

Further discussion in\nthe record occurred on February 21, 2019, when the presiding trial judge asked counsel whether\nthey had any concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d and\ninquired as to counsel\u2019s investigation of those issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                               59\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant desires to \u201c \u2018abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility\nthat the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect\u2019 \u201d). That we\nwould guess or infer what a competency evaluation would have shown debases our\nunique role in reviewing death-penalty appeals.\n       {\u00b6 205} The record is clear that when the trial court during the plea colloquy\nasked Lawson whether his mental clarity was affected by any medications, Lawson\ndisclosed that he was taking several\u2014naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and\nZoloft. The trial court questioned Lawson and defense counsel regarding these\nmedications and asked whether they could be affecting Lawson\u2019s ability to reason\nor his judgment. And while there is no affirmative indication in the record that\nLawson\u2019s medications did affect his ability to understand or reason, more inquiry\ncertainly was in order.

What medical\ndiagnoses and symptoms indicated that those medications should be prescribed?\nWas he experiencing or had he ever experienced any side effects from those\nmedications, including drowsiness, confusion, or suicidal thoughts? A competency\nexam could have provided answers to these questions to allay concerns regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency.

Using this\nmethod to make what amounts to a medical determination that a person charged\nwith a capital crime is or was competent is not only constitutionally flawed, it is\nunacceptable. This is particularly so when there is evidence that a defendant is\ntaking prescription medications that may affect his or her behavior or demeanor.2\nNo one asked Lawson whether drowsiness or confusion might be a side effect of\nany of his medications.           No one asked Lawson whether any of his current\nmedications were prescribed for impulse control. No one asked Lawson whether\nhe was depressed or suicidal. And no one asked him on the record why he was\nchoosing to plead guilty to capital offenses.\n         {\u00b6 207} Lawson\u2019s decision to waive a trial and enter pleas of guilty in this\ncapital case, combined with the trial court\u2019s apparent misgivings as they appear in\nthe record, support that further inquiry into Lawson\u2019s competency was necessary.\nI would thus reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment based on this issue and would\nremand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings regarding Lawson\u2019s\ncompetency.\n  C.

According to information available on the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website, drowsiness is a side effect\nof most of the medications Lawson was taking; confusion is a side effect of Vistaril and\nmetronidazole; and suicidal thoughts, loss of memory, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality\nare side effects of Zoloft. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs (accessed July 9, 2021)\n[https://perma.cc/UL5E-XLDS].\n\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nraised, raised by motion, or raised with the intention of obtaining or ordering a\nhearing.

See fn. 1 of this\nopinion, supra. The majority interprets the record to indicate that the trial-court\njudge was merely asking the defense whether it wanted a competency hearing. But\nisn\u2019t it just as plausible that the trial judge was truly questioning whether there was\nenough information available to reach a sound conclusion that Lawson was\ncompetent to not only stand trial but to waive it?

Rather, the court\n\u201craised\u201d the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency for purposes of R.C. 2945.37(B).\n        {\u00b6 210} Nothing prohibits this court from reviewing the record and\ndetermining that the issue of competency was raised. Nothing prohibits us from\nremanding this case for a competency evaluation to be conducted and a competency\nhearing to be held; the result of that hearing would determine the course of events\nfrom that point. Such a hearing is required by statute, but one was not held. If we\ndo this, we would accomplish several important aims. We would acknowledge the\ngravity of any capital defendant\u2019s adverse-interest request to plead guilty to a\ncapital offense. We would also provide valuable guidance to this state\u2019s trial courts\nthat creating a sound record compliant with R.C. 2945.37(B) is required, especially\nwhen the defendant is making an adverse-interest decision, such as waiving a trial\nand pleading guilty to one or more capital offenses. Remanding this case for a\ncompetency hearing would be of benefit to the public in ensuring a high standard\nof compliance with due-process principles in cases in which a death sentence could\nbe imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 211} The issue of Lawson\u2019s competency was raised, requiring the trial\ncourt to hold a competency hearing.

We should require that this hearing be held.\n                 D. General problems with the current framework\n       {\u00b6 212} When a capital defendant seeks to abandon his or her rights and\nacquiesce in entering a guilty plea, essentially clearing the thorny thicket on the\npath toward execution by the state, we owe that defendant, the victims and their\nfamilies, the lower courts, and the public at large a standardized approach to ensure\nfairness and uniformity in trials of this gravamen. Viewing the record using the\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d method falls short, because it is based on\ngleaning information from a record when often no record was made.\n       {\u00b6 213} It is not acceptable to simply rely on the observations of the trial\ncourt and/or the experiences and opinions of defense counsel that a criminal\ndefendant is competent to stand trial.

This conclusion was\n       bolstered by the opinion of Montgomery\u2019s attorney\u2014who was not a\n       medical expert\u2014that Montgomery understood the rights that he was\n       waiving. But if medication prevented Montgomery from truly\n       comprehending his actions, how reliable were his spoken assurances\n       and his signed statement to the contrary? The trial court did not\n       inquire about whether or how the medications affected\n       Montgomery\u2019s abilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n               I believe that more was required under Mink and Damon. At\n       the very least, when someone is undoubtedly under the influence of\n       a prescription medication when making the decision to enter a guilty\n       plea, the trial court must inquire about the effects of the medication\n       so that it can ensure that the defendant understands the gravity of the\n       situation and comprehends his or her actions. This court should not\n       affirm a conviction, let alone a death sentence, by guessing about\n       the mental competence of a defendant. Further inquiry was required\n       before the trial court accepted Montgomery\u2019s plea of guilty.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) State v.

Most attorneys and judges are not\npracticing mental-health or disability experts. Relying on a defense attorney\u2019s\nopinion, when that opinion is likely to be a one-off (based on how defense counsel\ninterprets the defendant\u2019s behavior at that particular juncture of the trial),\nanecdotally based opinion on the defendant\u2019s competency is neither a sound legal\nnor ethical practice.   Judging a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity to reason and\nunderstand through observed behavior by defense counsel and/or the court,\nespecially when coupled with a grave, adverse-interest decision such as pleading\nguilty to one or more capital offenses, denies due process when the defendant is\ntaking prescription medication with clinical indications and side effects that\nresearch shows may affect sound reasoning at the time the defendant changes his\nor her plea. And, finally, there is an inherent and systemic flaw that may not even\nbe recognized when we perpetuate reliance on judges\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 subjective\nassessments of a capital defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or change a plea:\nperhaps we perpetuate predisposed ideas and stereotyped, culture- or race-based\nperceptions and predispositions about what is acceptable behavior during a trial.\nSee State v.

And we find today that no medical evaluation for\ncompetency is required when a defendant\u2019s experienced attorney\u2014by self-\nproclamation\u2014has adjudged his client to be competent based on counsel\u2019s stated\nability to recognize mental illness, even when that client may not outwardly\ndemonstrate visible symptoms of mental illness to nonclinical laypersons during\nthe limited time they interact with them.\n       {\u00b6 215} In short, the approach perpetuated in this case denies criminal\ndefendants accused of capital crimes the guarantee that the laws of this state will\nbe applied in a rigorously constitutional manner when the consequences may be\nirrevocable. We should not continue to rely on indicia in the record as sufficient to\ndetermine a defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty without requiring evidence\nbased on sound medical judgment. It is incumbent on this court to require in death-\npenalty cases what is now readily at our disposal\u2014the use of science in a\ncompetency evaluation so that the state puts to death only those whom we may\nfairly determine have knowingly and competently pleaded guilty. In doing this, we\nwould avoid what amounts to guessing who is competent based on \u201cindicia\u201d (that\nmay or may not make it into the record) in favor of science-based evidence that is\ninformed by evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n     E. The need for evidence-based practices and not just indicia in the record\n        {\u00b6 216} On February 21, 2019, when the trial court held a change-of-plea\nhearing for Lawson, the presiding judge asked defense counsel whether they had\nany concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency.\u201d\nLead defense counsel first informed the court that he was not \u201ca psychologist or a\npsychiatrist\u201d and was not in a position to \u201ctechnically answer\u201d that question.\nDefense counsel then informed the trial court that Dr. Bob Stinson had been\nconsulted on the issue and that the defense did not intend to raise the issue of\nLawson\u2019s competency. At this point in the proceedings, there was nothing in the\nrecord about Lawson\u2019s being suicidal, having attempted suicide in the past, having\nexperienced (or at the time experiencing) confusion and possible hallucinations, or\ntaking several medications. The fact that those indicia were not yet in the record at\nthis point does not negate their existence. It does, however, demonstrate the\ninherent flaws in this court\u2019s current \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d test.\n        {\u00b6 217} Defense counsel, the prosecutors, and the trial court entertained the\npossibility of having Dr. Stinson render an opinion on Lawson\u2019s competency. Dr.\nStinson had been hired as a mental- and behavioral-health expert for the mitigation\nphase of the trial. He was not hired to perform a competency examination for the\npurpose of trial. However, had the trial court been able to conduct at least a review\nof his written report at this juncture of the proceedings, the following would have\nbecome apparent:\n1.      Lawson was raised in a dysfunctional family, suffered from poverty,\n        emotional abuse, and probably physical abuse, and was exposed to familial\n        incest;\n2.      Lawson\u2019s family members had a history of mental illness, including bipolar\n        disorder, depression, and suicidal behavior, and had a history of alcoholism\n        and drug abuse; Lawson\u2019s mother was rated as being \u201csignificantly\n        functionally impaired\u201d by her physician;\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n3.     Lawson had mental-health problems starting at least by age 13, when he\n       was enrolled in anger-management classes; he was diagnosed with bipolar\n       disorder in 2011; he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on two\n       occasions following suicidal and homicidal episodes; he has been diagnosed\n       with depressive disorder and posttraumatic-stress disorder;\n4.     Since his psychiatric hospitalizations, he has been on a number of\n       medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressant medicines,\n       antipsychotic drugs, and a medication to help with sleep and to control\n       impulses;\n5.     After his arrest, Lawson was seen by staff members at Shawnee Mental\n       Health, where he disclosed that he had attempted to hang himself several\n       years before and reported that he had been having thoughts of suicide;\n6.     After his arrest, Lawson was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and\n       reported to Dr. Stinson that he was having trouble sleeping and\n       concentrating and was occasionally having auditory and visual\n       hallucinations.\n       {\u00b6 218} This information about Lawson was not discussed at all at this point\nin the proceedings even though it is discussed in this court\u2019s majority opinion. The\nArron Lawson identified and described in Dr. Stinson\u2019s report is a person impaired\nby mental illness who has a stated history of being suicidal. The trial court was not\npresented with this information until the mitigation phase of the proceeding, and\nthis is precisely an example of the problem with the test this court adopted in the\npast and once again applies in Lawson\u2019s case. Had the trial court simply ordered a\ncompetency examination, as was discussed at several junctures during the trial\nphase, the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency to stand trial would have been made clear\nin the record beyond the mere presence of vague indicia that the record now\ncontains.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 219} Putting someone to death for his or her crimes, even when the\ncrimes are heinous and when it is apparent that the person on trial is the person who\ncommitted the crimes, is always subject to the constitutional due-process principles\ncontained in the Bill of Rights, a document once demanded by, and its contents now\nguaranteed to, the people. Due-process principles are not satisfied by guessing or\nby the acknowledged inexactitude of gleaning indicia from a sketchy trial record.\nThe determination of Lawson\u2019s competency should be based on evidence. That the\nquestion of his competency was \u201craised\u201d was enough to require the trial court to\norder a competency evaluation and a hearing on the matter under R.C. 2945.37(B),\nno matter what his attorney said to the court.

This\ncourt should be requiring that evidence-based practices be the standard for\ncompetency evidence used by the courts of this state for what are essentially clinical\nconclusions regarding defendants\u2019 competency to stand trial. Once we do this, we\nwill have taken a giant stride to ensure that due-process principles are adhered to in\nthe prosecutions of persons accused of crimes, especially those accused of\ncommitting capital crimes.\n     F. Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest request\n       {\u00b6 221} When reading the fact pattern of violence and often torture that\noccurs in nearly every death-penalty case, the reader is left to conjecture: Who in\ntheir right mind could do such a thing? Since that perception is present from the\nbeginning, and since an adverse-interest request such as agreeing to plead guilty to\na capital offense as charged could be viewed as irrational and against the\ndefendant\u2019s self-interests, it would be best for courts to start from a presumption\nthat competency is at issue whenever a defendant makes an adverse-interest\nrequest. Starting with this presumption and questioning competency in this way\nwould mean that a trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2945.37(B) would be ensured.\nThe trial court would then be required to conduct further inquiry, thus creating a\nrecord and instilling a more reliable, constitutional approach.\n       {\u00b6 222} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest alleviates the necessity for a court to inquire as to defense counsel\u2019s position\non the subject. The judiciary must dismiss the temptation to put defense attorneys\nin the position of assessing their clients\u2019 capabilities, which goes beyond the\nattorneys\u2019 expertise and their ethical duties. We also should steer courts away from\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nlooking for subjectively bizarre behavior and encourage them to simply obtain\ninformation from a clinical expert using evidence-based practices.\n       {\u00b6 223} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest also triggers the building of a record. A competency examination and a\nhearing would be the most comprehensive way to ensure a complete and thorough\nrecord. The trial court should make a finding one way or the other based on\nevidence in the record regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand\nchoices and assist in his or her own defense. This includes determining whether\nthe defendant possesses the ability to comprehend the ramifications of his or her\ndecision, including understanding that the choice may lead to death, determining\nwhether the defendant is able to make such a decision knowingly and intelligently,\nnot unduly affected by conditions of mental health, physical health, or\nimprisonment, and determining whether the defendant possesses the ability to\nreason logically and fully understands the ramifications of his decision.

Mink, in which the defendant was charged\nwith aggravated murder for the horrendous stabbings and beatings of his parents,\nthe trial court sua sponte appointed two psychologists to conduct separate\ncompetency examinations when Mink first informed the court that he wished to\nenter pleas of guilty to all counts, to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand to represent himself. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Ohio St.3d 350</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2004-Ohio-1580</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">805 N.E.2d 1064</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat \u00b6 31, 59-60.

For example, a clinical\nexamination might not be required when a defendant wishes to waive representation\nby counsel. When making a decision like that, the defendant still has procedural\nand substantive protections in place. Courts should seek to examine a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency in view of the context and purpose of the proceeding. Therefore,\ncompetency evaluations should be specifically tailored to address the capacity and\nthe ability of the defendant to understand the ramifications of the specific adverse-\ninterest request he or she is making.

Martin and\n        Dr. Kim Stookey, the Court finds that the Defendant:\n                 1.) Understands the choice between life and death,\n                 2.) Has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to\n                 pursue the presentation of evidence,\n                 3.)

Understands his right to present mitigating evidence,\n                 6.) Understands the meaning of mitigating evidence,\n                 7.)

Understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence.\n                 The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n        presentation of mitigating evidence is made knowingly, intelligently and\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 226} Additionally, requiring that a record be developed when a\ndefendant invokes an adverse-interest request ensures balance in the system. If\nLawson had been asked further questions, his suicidal ideation and suicide attempt\nmay have become known to the court, as counsel presumably were aware of those\nmatters. At that point, any court would certainly have sought further information\nabout the defendant\u2019s mental health and capabilities before allowing the trial to\nproceed for the state to seek his execution.

TALIANI, Appellant.\n\n\n                               Opinion filed October 7, 2021.\n\n\n\n        CHIEF JUSTICE ANNE M. BURKE delivered the judgment of the court, with\n     opinion.\n\n         Justices Garman, Theis, Neville, Michael J. Burke, and Overstreet concurred in\n     the judgment and opinion.\n\n        Justice Carter took no part in the decision.\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\u00b61       After a jury trial in Bureau County, Steven A. Taliani (petitioner) was convicted\n     of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 1992)) and aggravated battery\n     with a firearm (id. \u00a7 12-4.2(a)(1)) in relation to the July 12, 1994, shooting death\n\f     of his girlfriend, Francee Wolf, and the shooting and injury of Wolf\u2019s mother,\n     Clementina Frasco. A direct appeal, two postconviction petitions, and a motion for\n     relief from judgment were all unsuccessful.\n\n\u00b62       At issue now is petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive\n     postconviction petition, in which he asserts that he has set forth a colorable claim\n     of actual innocence based on \u201ca change in the law that allows for a new affirmative\n     defense [which] constitutes newly discovered evidence for purposes of an actual\n     innocence claim.\u201d The circuit court rejected this argument and denied petitioner\n     leave to file his second successive postconviction petition. That ruling was affirmed\n     on appeal. 2020 IL App (3d) 170546. We granted petitioner leave to appeal to this\n     court (Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019)) and now affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial\n     of petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b63                                           BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64       On July 12, 1994, Clementina Frasco arrived home from work around 11 p.m.\n     and found that her 22-year-old daughter, Francee Wolf, was not there. Attempting\n     to locate her daughter, Frasco called one of Wolf\u2019s friends and learned that Wolf\n     was at petitioner\u2019s home. Frasco was aware that petitioner and Wolf had been\n     dating since the summer of 1993 but that Wolf wanted to end her relationship with\n     petitioner because he had become overly possessive and physically abusive. In late\n     December 1993, Cari Carlson, Wolf\u2019s cousin, witnessed petitioner slap, bite, choke,\n     and verbally insult Wolf before throwing Wolf to the ground. Wolf had also\n     confided to her friends that, on one occasion, petitioner admitted to Wolf that he\n     held a shotgun to her head as she slept and told her he had plans to kill her and then\n     commit suicide.\n\n\u00b65       Frasco called petitioner\u2019s home, but petitioner told Frasco that Wolf was not\n     there. Concerned for her daughter\u2019s well-being, Frasco drove to petitioner\u2019s home,\n     knocked on the door, and called out to her daughter. No one answered, but shortly\n     thereafter Frasco heard a loud noise1 come from inside the house. Wolf, dressed\n     only in a pair of silk shorts, then came running out of the house, crying and\n     screaming \u201cPsycho.\u201d Wolf was bleeding, and she told Frasco that petitioner hit her\n\n        1\n            The loud noise was later determined to be the discharge of a shotgun.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f       head. Wolf got into the front passenger side of Frasco\u2019s car, and Frasco attempted\n       to drive away.\n\n\u00b66         Petitioner then ran out of the house, dressed only in a pair of gray boxer shorts,\n       carrying a shotgun. He went to the driver\u2019s side of Frasco\u2019s car and fired a shot\n       through the driver\u2019s side window, attempting to hit Wolf but instead hitting the side\n       of Frasco\u2019s head. Petitioner then walked around to the passenger side, where Wolf\n       was bent over in the front seat with her head down. Petitioner fired a shot through\n       the passenger-side window, striking Wolf in the back, killing her.\n\n\u00b67         Officer Richard Taylor, who was patrolling in the area, heard the shots and\n       arrived on the scene as Frasco\u2019s car rolled into the street, jumped the curb, and came\n       to a stop. Frasco was screaming, \u201cHelp, we\u2019ve been shot.\u201d Officer Taylor radioed\n       for an ambulance as he went to the car to check on the occupants. When Taylor\n       checked on Frasco, she identified petitioner as the person who shot her and her\n       daughter.\n\n\u00b68         Officer Taylor then noticed a man, dressed only in boxer shorts, get into a black\n       car and drive off at a high rate of speed. Taylor radioed his partner, Officer Kevin\n       Sangston, who pursued the fleeing car and, ultimately, apprehended and arrested\n       petitioner.\n\n\u00b69        On August 9, 1994, petitioner was indicted on charges of first degree murder\n       and aggravated battery with a firearm. Appointed counsel moved to have petitioner\n       examined for fitness to stand trial and evaluated regarding his mental status at the\n       time of the shootings. The trial court granted the motion. However, before petitioner\n       was examined for fitness, he obtained new defense counsel, who withdrew the\n       motion and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. A psychiatrist, Dr.\n       Robert E. Chapman, was retained to examine petitioner and evaluate whether he\n       was sane at the time of the shootings.\n\n\u00b6 10       Later that year, petitioner was tried before a jury. At trial, the State presented\n       extensive testimony from numerous witnesses regarding petitioner\u2019s behavior in\n       the weeks and hours before the shootings. Several of Wolf\u2019s friends testified that,\n       during the three weeks prior to the shooting, petitioner had become increasingly\n       jealous about a perceived sexual relationship between Wolf and a man named\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       Kevin Trovero. Witness testimony also provided a timeline of petitioner\u2019s activity\n       on Tuesday, July 12, 1994, the day of the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 11       Testimony revealed that petitioner began the day by going to work at the\n       jewelry store he owned. He had lunch with Marlo Capponi, whom he had been\n       dating since January 1994. 2 Petitioner and Capponi made plans to get together later\n       that evening. After lunch, petitioner went back to the jewelry shop, where he stayed\n       until he closed around 7 p.m. As petitioner was driving home, he saw a friend,\n       Michelle Castelli, driving her car. While the two cars were stopped at a traffic light,\n       they arranged to meet around 7:30 p.m. at a bar named Ellie\u2019s Tap. Castelli testified\n       that, at Ellie\u2019s, petitioner told her that he loved Wolf but that he was concerned she\n       might be seeing another man (Trovero). Castelli testified that she knew petitioner\n       well and, although he expressed concern about Wolf, he appeared to be his normal\n       self and did not appear to be under the influence of either drugs or alcohol.\n\n\u00b6 12       The bartender at Ellie\u2019s testified that he had known petitioner for eight years\n       and, on the night of the shootings, he saw petitioner come into the bar and have\n       three or four beers. He said petitioner \u201cacted normally\u201d and looked \u201ctotally sober\u201d\n       when he left the bar around 8:30 p.m.\n\n\u00b6 13       After leaving Ellie\u2019s bar, petitioner went to Verucchi\u2019s Bar and Restaurant.\n       Arthur Verucchi was working that night, and he testified that petitioner arrived\n       around 9:30 p.m. and stayed at the bar for 30 to 45 minutes. During that time,\n       petitioner had one vodka and water. Verucchi said petitioner did not act strangely\n       or appear disoriented or confused, nor did he seem to be under the influence of\n       alcohol or drugs. Two other bar patrons at Verucchi\u2019s that night confirmed Arthur\u2019s\n       testimony. After leaving Verucchi\u2019s, petitioner went home, intending to meet with\n       Capponi later on. But when he arrived home, Wolf was there.\n\n\u00b6 14      Kevin Trovero testified that, at about 11:15 p.m., petitioner phoned his home.\n       His wife answered the phone, and he got on another extension. Petitioner asked\n       Trovero\u2019s wife if she knew her husband was dating Wolf. Kevin then spoke up,\n\n           2\n             Capponi testified that she had \u201cheard rumors\u201d that petitioner was also dating Wolf. However,\n       she said petitioner denied it when she asked him about Wolf. After his arrest, Capponi regularly\n       visited petitioner in jail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -4-\n\f       denying petitioner\u2019s accusations. Both Kevin and his wife testified that, although\n       petitioner was accusatory and angry, he seemed in control of his faculties and was\n       not ranting or incoherent. After this phone call, petitioner and Wolf argued. Then\n       Frasco arrived at petitioner\u2019s home, and the shootings occurred as detailed above.\n\n\u00b6 15       At trial, Officer Sangston testified that, just after midnight, in the early morning\n       on July 13, 1994, he received instructions from Officer Taylor to apprehend the\n       driver of a black car with license plate A-U-S-T-N-T. Soon after receiving the radio\n       message, Sangston observed the vehicle and activated his lights. The car sped away,\n       and Sangston pursued with lights and siren on. The black vehicle continued without\n       stopping, passing several stop signs, then turned onto Route 6 and sped up, traveling\n       at approximately 75 miles per hour. When the vehicle traveled through an area\n       known as \u201cthe curves,\u201d which was under construction, the driver hit some\n       construction barrels, lost control, and crashed into the guardrail.\n\n\u00b6 16       Because Officer Sangston was told the driver could be armed, he drew his gun\n       and situated himself behind the door of his police car. The driver got out of his\n       vehicle and started walking slowly toward Sangston with his hands up. Petitioner\n       said, \u201cI\u2019m all out of shells.\u201d Sangston recognized the driver as petitioner from\n       previous encounters and ordered him to get down on the ground. Petitioner\n       disobeyed Sangston\u2019s command and, instead, continued to walk slowly toward\n       Sangston, saying \u201cShoot me, please shoot me.\u201d Sangston responded, \u201cSteve, just\n       get on the ground, we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d But petitioner continued to walk slowly\n       toward Sangston and said, \u201cThere is nothing to talk about. I have nothing left to\n       live for. Shoot me.\u201d Petitioner also threatened to take Sangston\u2019s gun away from\n       him and shoot himself.\n\n\u00b6 17       When petitioner got closer, Sangston holstered his gun and pepper sprayed\n       petitioner. Petitioner was then handcuffed and placed in Sangston\u2019s police car.\n       Once petitioner was secured, Sangston went to petitioner\u2019s vehicle and recovered a\n       double-barrel, sawed-off 20-gauge shotgun from the passenger-side floor.\n       Petitioner and the gun were transported to the police station.\n\n\u00b6 18       While being transported, petitioner said, \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d\n       and \u201cWhy the hell does she have to show up, we had everything worked out.\u201d At\n       the police station, petitioner continued to ask for someone to shoot him until\n       Sangston moved him to where he was to be interviewed. At that point, petitioner\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d Sangston replied that someone would be in to question\n       him. Petitioner then commented, \u201cHell of a way to get a DUI.\u201d Sangston testified\n       that, until then, there had been no mention of alcohol consumption or \u201cDUI\u201d by\n       anyone and that he saw no evidence that petitioner was under the influence of\n       \u201canything.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 19       Sangston stayed with petitioner while he waited to be interviewed. During this\n       time, petitioner apologized to Sangston for \u201cputting him through all this.\u201d Sangston\n       testified that, based on his observations of petitioner and their conversations, he\n       believed that petitioner was oriented as to time, place, and circumstance;\n       understood the criminality of his earlier conduct; and knew right from wrong.\n\n\u00b6 20       At the Spring Valley Police Department, in the early morning hours of July 13,\n       1994, petitioner was interviewed by Spring Valley police chief Doug Bernabei, who\n       was accompanied by Mike Miroux, an investigator for the Bureau County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department. Both Chief Bernabei and Miroux testified at trial, providing similar\n       accounts of the interview with petitioner, which took place from approximately 1\n       a.m. until 2:45 a.m. After petitioner was advised of his rights, he signed a waiver\n       and agreed to speak with them. Petitioner also signed a consent form, allowing the\n       police to enter his house to search it.\n\n\u00b6 21       Chief Bernabei testified that, during the interview, petitioner gave three\n       different statements. Initially, petitioner told Chief Bernabei and Miroux that he\n       remembered going to Verucchi\u2019s that night and leaving there at about 9:30 p.m. but\n       that he had no recollection of the rest of the evening until he was arrested by Officer\n       Sangston.\n\n\u00b6 22        Chief Bernabei testified that he asked petitioner to tell him everything he had\n       done since the previous Friday. In response, petitioner related the events of the\n       weekend and then continued on through Tuesday, the day of the shooting. This\n       time, petitioner said that, when he got home from Verucchi\u2019s, Wolf was at his\n       house. Petitioner remembered that Wolf got angry and they argued. He said Wolf\n       left his house and then stood outside screaming obscenities at him. Petitioner told\n       them he locked the door so Wolf could not get back inside but that then Wolf drove\n       away in her car and petitioner decided to go after her. Petitioner said he got in his\n       car and started driving around, trying to find Wolf. While searching for Wolf,\n       petitioner said he was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f\u00b6 23      Chief Bernabei testified that he then asked petitioner about the sawed-off\n       shotgun that was found in his car. Bernabei testified that, initially, petitioner denied\n       he had a gun in his car. Later, however, petitioner put his head in his hands, got\n       very \u201csomber,\u201d and said he would tell Bernabei \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24       In this third statement, petitioner told Chief Bernabei and Miroux that Wolf was\n       at his house when he got home from Verucchi\u2019s. Petitioner told them he and Wolf\n       had consensual sexual relations. Afterward, however, they got into an argument\n       because he was dating Marlo Capponi and he accused Wolf of dating Trovero.\n       Petitioner said that Wolf became angry because he called Trovero on the phone.\n       Petitioner then claimed that he thought Wolf was reaching for his shotgun, which\n       she knew he kept under his bed. Instead, petitioner got the gun, and when Wolf\n       taunted him, he fired two shots in the bedroom. Wolf then ran out of his house\n       screaming, \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 25       Petitioner told Chief Bernabei that, when Wolf ran out of the house, he got two\n       shells from his dresser drawer and reloaded his double-barrel shotgun. Then he ran\n       after Wolf. Petitioner told Chief Bernabei he saw Wolf in his yard, standing near a\n       tree, and that he shot at her to scare her so she would go back in the house where\n       he planned to kill her according to \u201chis plan.\u201d Although petitioner did not say\n       anything about Frasco, he admitted that he saw Wolf get into a car and that he fired\n       the shotgun at Wolf through the driver\u2019s side window because he wanted to kill\n       Wolf. Petitioner also admitted that he knew he was not arrested for driving under\n       the influence.\n\n\u00b6 26       Around 3 a.m., the officers who searched petitioner\u2019s house brought to the\n       station a typewritten letter they found in the kitchen of petitioner\u2019s home and a\n       typewritten note that had been attached to the door of petitioner\u2019s home. After\n       obtaining these documents, Chief Bernabei questioned petitioner a second time. He\n       showed the documents to petitioner, who explained that he had written out the note\n       and letter a few weeks earlier and then typed them, using the typewriter at the\n       jewelry store he owned. Chief Bernabei asked petitioner to sign and date the pages\n       of the letter as they reviewed it together.\n\n\u00b6 27      Petitioner explained to Chief Bernabei that he had been thinking about killing\n       Wolf for a long time and that he had a plan, which he claimed to have discussed\n       with Wolf. The plan was to kill Wolf at his home and then commit suicide so they\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       could be together forever. Petitioner also told Chief Bernabei that, a few weeks\n       earlier, he told his sister-in-law that he was depressed and thinking of committing\n       suicide. She told him to get help, and petitioner\u2019s brother came to petitioner\u2019s house\n       and took his shotgun away. Petitioner then made an appointment to see a\n       psychiatrist, Dr. Brady. Petitioner said he kept the appointment, which lasted about\n       two hours, but he did not feel any better after talking to the doctor. Petitioner also\n       admitted to Chief Bernabei that, even though he had decided to kill Wolf and\n       commit suicide prior to his appointment with Dr. Brady, he did not tell Dr. Brady\n       his plan. Instead, immediately after the appointment, he went to his store to type\n       the documents regarding his murder-suicide plan. Later on, he retrieved the shotgun\n       from his brother\u2019s house.\n\n\u00b6 28      Petitioner told Chief Bernabei that Dr. Brady prescribed two medications for\n       him\u2014one was to be taken three times a day, the other once at night. When Chief\n       Bernabei asked petitioner if he took the medicine, petitioner said that he did, but\n       not as directed. He said that he skipped doses of the one medication he was\n       supposed to take three times a day because it bothered his stomach.\n\n\u00b6 29      The typewritten note and letter written by petitioner were offered into evidence.\n       The note, which had been posted to the front door of petitioner\u2019s home, stated:\n\n           \u201cDO NOT COME IN ALONE!!!!!!!! WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND\n           INSIDE MAY NOT BE APPEALING. I AM VERY SORRY. ITS OK.\n           BEFORE YOU GO ANY FARTHER READ THE LETTER ON THE TABLE.\n           THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN SOME. ITS OK. I\u2019M NOT AFRAID\n           ANYMORE.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30       The three-page letter addressed to \u201cChuck and Julie,\u201d which petitioner signed\n       and dated as he reviewed it with Chief Bernabei, had been found inside the home,\n       on the kitchen table. In this letter, petitioner left detailed instructions regarding the\n       distribution of his belongings and the handling of his business affairs. The\n       following statement was also in the letter: \u201cI can\u2019t have Francee do this to anyone\n       else especially me. Try to keep us together if you can.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 31       After the State rested, defense counsel called two psychiatrists to testify for the\n       defense: Dr. Richard Brady, who had been petitioner\u2019s treating psychiatrist, and Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       Robert Chapman, who had examined petitioner after the shootings and was called\n       as an expert witness regarding petitioner\u2019s sanity at the time of the shootings.\n\n\u00b6 32       Dr. Brady testified that he saw petitioner in his office on June 27, 1994,\n       approximately two weeks prior to the shootings. During the appointment, petitioner\n       reported that he was feeling depressed and had had suicidal thoughts \u201cthe weekend\n       before last.\u201d Dr. Brady said that petitioner assured him that he was not having any\n       suicidal or homicidal thoughts at that time and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d harm himself or\n       others. Dr. Brady further testified that he diagnosed petitioner with \u201crecurrent major\n       depressive disorder,\u201d general anxiety, and alcohol dependence. He prescribed two\n       medications for depression, BuSpar and Desyrel, and recommended that petitioner\n       obtain individual therapy. An appointment was made for July 11, but petitioner did\n       not show up for that appointment.\n\n\u00b6 33        Dr. Chapman, the psychiatrist retained by defense counsel, testified that he had\n       examined petitioner on September 1, 1994, approximately nine weeks after the\n       shootings. His diagnosis, after evaluating petitioner and reading \u201call of the official\n       reports,\u201d was that petitioner suffered from major affective disorder, obsessive-\n       compulsive disorder, and depression with suicidal ideation. Dr. Chapman reported\n       that petitioner had a high risk of suicide and apparently attempted to commit suicide\n       at least once while he was awaiting trial. 3\n\n\u00b6 34       Dr. Chapman also testified that, during the examination, petitioner appeared\n       anxious, \u201cquite confused, disorganized, and prone to intense feelings of panic.\u201d\n       Additionally, Dr. Chapman testified that petitioner reported feeling as if he was\n       \u201closing his mind\u201d and having \u201cbizarre and unusual sensory experiences and\n       confused thinking.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 35       Although Dr. Chapman was aware that petitioner had taken the medications\n       BuSpar and Desyrel, prescribed by Dr. Brady, he made no correlation between\n       petitioner\u2019s mental status at the time of the shootings and the medications he was\n       prescribed. Dr. Chapman testified that petitioner\u2019s depression had \u201csubstantially\n       impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his behavior.\u201d On cross-\n\n\n           3\n            One of the guards testified that the suicide attempt did not appear to be serious. Petitioner used\n       a broken piece of plastic to cut his wrist. There was very little blood, and petitioner did not need to\n       be hospitalized.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f       examination, Chapman emphasized, \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was unable [to appreciate the\n       criminality of his behavior], I said he was substantially impaired.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 36       After hearing all the evidence, the jury rejected the insanity defense and found\n       petitioner guilty of both first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm.\n       The trial court sentenced petitioner to an extended term of 70 years\u2019 incarceration\n       for first degree murder and a consecutive term of 30 years for aggravated battery\n       with a firearm, for a total sentence of 100 years.\n\n\u00b6 37       In his direct appeal, petitioner argued that his sentence was excessive and that\n       the trial court should have entered a directed verdict of not guilty by reason of\n       insanity because the evidence proved that he was legally insane at the time of the\n       shooting. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentence (People v.\n       Taliani, No. 3-94-0921 (1995) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court\n       Rule 23)), and this court denied his petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 38       In 1996, petitioner filed pro se a postconviction petition alleging that his trial\n       counsel and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance. Petitioner cited 17\n       separate errors by trial counsel, including counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to\n       suppress petitioner\u2019s confession. Petitioner also made six claims of ineffective\n       assistance of appellate counsel. The trial court dismissed this postconviction\n       petition at the first stage, and the appellate court affirmed. People v. Taliani, No. 3-\n       96-0672 (1997) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23). This\n       court denied the petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 39       In 2000, Taliani filed pro se a motion for relief from judgment, claiming in part\n       that he should receive a new trial because a State witness had testified in a civil suit\n       that petitioner\u2019s shooting of Frasco was accidental. Petitioner later amended the\n       motion to add an Apprendi claim (see Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n       (2000)). The trial court denied the motion, and the appellate court affirmed. People\n       v. Taliani, No. 3-00-0913 (2003) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court\n       Rule 23). We denied leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 40       In 2002, while the appeal of his 2000 motion was still pending, petitioner filed\n       a second petition for relief from judgment, alleging that Dr. Brady, one of the\n       psychiatrists who had testified at his trial, had been convicted of practicing\n       medicine without a license. Petitioner later amended his motion with several\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       additional claims and accompanying documentation. This motion was treated as a\n       successive postconviction petition, and in 2003, the trial court appointed the public\n       defender to represent petitioner.\n\n\u00b6 41       Several months later, petitioner successfully moved to replace the public\n       defender with retained counsel. After a number of additional motions were ruled\n       on, defense counsel filed an amended successive postconviction petition in 2014.\n       In this amended petition it was alleged that defense counsel knew at the time of trial\n       that petitioner was taking BuSpar and Desyrel, medications that Dr. Brady had\n       prescribed, and that there was medical information at the time of trial that indicated\n       this combination of medications \u201ccan lead to a serious condition known as\n       \u2018serotonin syndrome\u2019 \u201d that can cause \u201cirritability, altered consciousness,\n       confusion, hallucination, coma,\u201d and \u201csuicidal thoughts.\u201d It was claimed in the\n       amended petition that trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by\n       withdrawing the petition for a fitness hearing and by failing to seek a second degree\n       murder instruction based on the prescribed medication he was taking. In support of\n       this ineffectiveness claim, petitioner attached to the petition various medical\n       articles about serotonin syndrome, which had been published prior to petitioner\u2019s\n       1994 trial and, therefore, would have been available to trial counsel.\n\n\u00b6 42       The trial court dismissed the successive petition, finding that petitioner failed\n       to show cause and prejudice and, therefore, the claims were barred by res judicata\n       because petitioner could have raised them in his first postconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 43       Petitioner appealed the dismissal, arguing that he had met the cause and\n       prejudice standard to file a successive petition on his ineffective assistance claims.\n       Petitioner also alleged that he did not need to show cause and prejudice regarding\n       his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to proffer a jury instruction\n       on second degree murder because this claim was an actual innocence claim.\n       Although petitioner admitted that he did not meet the general requirements for\n       proving an actual innocence claim, he argued that he did not need to do so because\n       he was only claiming to be \u201cactually innocent\u201d of \u201ca certain classification of\n       crimes,\u201d i.e., first degree murder. Petitioner explained his argument in this way\u2014\n       if a second degree murder instruction had been given to the jury, he would have\n       been found guilty of second degree murder and, therefore, he would have been\n       \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crime of first degree murder, for which he was convicted.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f\u00b6 44       The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the successive petition, finding\n       that the ineffectiveness claims could have been raised in his initial petition and\n       failed to meet the cause and prejudice test. The court also found that petitioner\u2019s\n       alleged \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim \u201cdefies logic and finds no support in Illinois law.\u201d\n       People v. Taliani, 2016 IL App (3d) 150478-U, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 45       In 2017, petitioner filed, pro se, a motion seeking leave to file a second\n       successive postconviction petition, which is the subject of the appeal now before\n       this court. Petitioner contended in the circuit court that he should be allowed to file\n       this successive petition because his claim is one of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d More\n       specifically, petitioner alleged that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which\n       he was convicted because, at the time he committed those offenses, he was\n       involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medications, BuSpar and Desyrel, which caused him to suffer from serotonin\n       syndrome. Petitioner attached some of the same literature on serotonin syndrome\n       that he had attached to his earlier postconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 46       Petitioner acknowledged in the circuit court that an actual innocence claim must\n       be supported by \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d and that the evidence that he took\n       prescription medications that could cause serotonin syndrome was not \u201cnewly\n       discovered.\u201d He argued, nonetheless, that the affirmative defense of involuntary\n       intoxication based on unwarned side effects from prescription medication was not\n       recognized in Illinois until long after his trial, when People v. Hari, 218 Ill. 2d 275\n       (2006), was decided. Petitioner claimed that this newly available affirmative\n       defense constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d for purposes of his actual\n       innocence claim. Petitioner further argued that it was more likely than not that, had\n       he been able to raise this affirmative defense at the time of his trial, the jury would\n       have found that he was involuntarily intoxicated and, as a result, he would have\n       been found not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted.\n\n\u00b6 47       The circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file his successive\n       postconviction petition and dismissed the petition, holding that petitioner failed to\n       present a colorable claim of actual innocence because he failed to establish with\n       any reasonable degree of certainty that no reasonable juror would have convicted\n       him had the jury considered the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication due\n       to unwarned side effects of prescribed medication.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 48       Petitioner appealed, and a majority of the appellate court affirmed the circuit\n       court. 2020 IL App (3d) 170546. The majority, while questioning whether it was\n       even proper to permit a newly available affirmative defense to serve as the newly\n       discovered evidence element of an actual innocence claim, went on to hold that \u201cthe\n       allegations and supporting documentation did not show that these alleged side\n       effects rendered defendant intoxicated to the degree that he lacked substantial\n       capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\n       conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u00b6 27.\n       Justice McDade dissented and would have found that petitioner set forth a colorable\n       claim of actual innocence. Id. \u00b6 36 (McDade, J., dissenting).\n\n\u00b6 49      We granted petitioner leave to appeal to this court.\n\n\n\u00b6 50                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 51       The single issue before us is whether the trial court erred when it denied\n       petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive postconviction petition.\n       Petitioner contends that leave should have been granted because he presented a\n       colorable claim of actual innocence.\n\n\u00b6 52       Where, as here, a petitioner raises an actual innocence claim in a successive\n       postconviction petition, the trial court should deny leave only where, as a matter of\n       law, no colorable claim of actual innocence has been presented. People v. Edwards,\n       2012 IL 111711, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33. Since this is a legal question, we review de novo the\n       circuit court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file his successive\n       postconviction petition. People v. Robinson, 2020 IL 123849, \u00b6 40.\n\n\u00b6 53       The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (West\n       2016)) provides a statutory remedy to criminal defendants who claim that\n       substantial violations of their constitutional rights occurred at trial. Edwards, 2012\n       IL 111711, \u00b6 21. Because a postconviction petition is a collateral attack on the\n       judgment, issues that were raised and decided on direct appeal are barred from\n       consideration by the doctrine of res judicata, while issues that could have been\n       raised, but were not, are forfeited. People v. Holman, 2017 IL 120655, \u00b6 25. In\n       addition to this procedural default rule, both the Act and our caselaw make clear\n       that the filing of only one postconviction proceeding is contemplated. Id.; see also\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f       725 ILCS 5/122-3 (West 2016) (\u201c[a]ny claim *** not raised in the original or an\n       amended petition is waived\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 54       Because successive petitions impede the finality of criminal litigation, the rules\n       barring successive petitions will be relaxed only \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhen fundamental fairness so\n       requires.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Holman, 2017 IL 120655, \u00b6 25 (quoting People v. Coleman, 2013 IL\n       113307, \u00b6 81, quoting People v. Pitsonbarger, 205 Ill. 2d 444, 458 (2002)); see also\n       Edwards, 2012 IL 111711, \u00b6 23; People v. Ortiz, 235 Ill. 2d 319, 329 (2009); People\n       v. Washington, 171 Ill. 2d 475, 488 (1996).\n\n\u00b6 55       In Illinois, we have recognized only two exceptions where \u201cfundamental\n       fairness\u201d compels the bar against successive petitions to be lifted. Coleman, 2013\n       IL 113307, \u00b6 82. The first is the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception, which has been\n       codified in the Act. See 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (West 2016). The second is the\n       \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d exception, which requires a petitioner to make\n       a persuasive showing of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d See Coleman, 2013 IL 113307, \u00b6 83;\n       Edwards, 2012 IL 111711, \u00b6 23; Ortiz, 235 Ill. 2d at 329.\n\n\u00b6 56        In Washington, we were tasked with deciding whether a \u201cfree standing\u201d claim\n       of actual innocence based on new evidence could be raised in a petition under the\n       Act. We explained that a \u201cfree standing\u201d claim of actual innocence is one in which\n       newly discovered evidence is not being used to supplement an assertion of a\n       constitutional violation with respect to the defendant\u2019s trial or that the evidence at\n       trial was insufficient to convict the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 479-80. Rather, a \u201cfree standing\u201d claim of actual\n       innocence is one in which newly discovered evidence makes a persuasive showing\n       that the petitioner did not commit the charged offense and was, therefore,\n       wrongfully convicted. Id. at 489.\n\n\u00b6 57       Since postconviction relief is unavailable if no constitutional right is implicated\n       in the asserted claim, we considered in Washington whether, as a matter of\n       procedural or substantive due process, additional process should be afforded a\n       petitioner when newly discovered evidence indicates that the convicted petitioner\n       is actually innocent. Id. at 486-87. We found that there was footing in the due\n       process clause of our Illinois Constitution for asserting freestanding innocence\n       claims based upon newly discovered evidence. Id. at 489. We reasoned that\n       imprisonment of the innocent would be so conscience shocking as to trigger\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f       operation of substantive due process. Id. at 487-88. Thus, we held that, \u201cas a matter\n       of Illinois constitutional jurisprudence,\u201d a claim of newly discovered evidence that\n       makes a persuasive showing that the petitioner is factually innocent of the crime\n       for which he was convicted is cognizable under the Act as a matter of due process.\n       Id. at 489.\n\n\u00b6 58        Procedurally, a petitioner who claims actual innocence in a successive\n       postconviction petition must first obtain leave of court to file the petition.

Wrice, 2012 IL 111860, \u00b6 47; 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (West 2016).\n       Substantively, however, a petitioner need not show cause and prejudice (Ortiz, 235\n       Ill. 2d at 330) but must support his claim of actual innocence with evidence that is\n       \u201cnewly discovered, material and not merely cumulative, and of such conclusive\n       character that it would probably change the result on retrial\u201d (id. at 333 (where a\n       defendant sets forth a claim of actual innocence in a successive postconviction\n       petition, the defendant is excused from showing cause and prejudice and, instead,\n       must meet the Washington standard)).

We made it clear in Coleman that the standard set forth in Edwards,\n       and our holding in Ortiz that actual innocence claims need not show cause and\n       prejudice, did not alter the requirements for filing an actual innocence claim in a\n       successive postconviction petition. See Coleman, 2013 IL 113307, \u00b6 93. We stated,\n       \u201cOur commitment to [the Washington standard] is unwavering. We have not diluted\n       the substantive standard for actual-innocence claims, as the State thinks we did in\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f       Ortiz. And we have not strengthened that standard, as the State hopes we did in\n       Edwards.\u201d Id. Thus, the Edwards standard is merely a restatement of the well-\n       established rule that, to set forth a colorable claim of actual innocence in a\n       successive postconviction petition, the petitioner must produce newly discovered\n       evidence that, when considered along with all the evidence presented at trial, would\n       probably lead to a different result on retrial. Id. \u00b6 96; Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 489.\n\n\u00b6 60        Petitioner contends that he has met all the requirements for setting forth a\n       colorable claim of actual innocence. He concedes that it was known at the time of\n       his trial that he was taking the prescribed medications, BuSpar and Desyrel, when\n       he committed the offenses for which he was convicted and, therefore, this is not\n       newly discovered evidence. However, petitioner argues that it was not known at the\n       time of his trial that these two medications, taken together, could cause serotonin\n       syndrome, a condition that may bring about mental status changes such as\n       heightened irritability, altered consciousness, and confusion. Petitioner claims this\n       information was only developed in the last several years. 4 However, he goes on to\n       argue that, even if this information had been available at the time of his trial, he\n       could not have raised the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication due to\n       unwarned side effects from prescription medication because that affirmative\n       defense was not recognized until this court\u2019s decision in Hari, 218 Ill. 2d 275. Thus,\n       it is petitioner\u2019s position that, although it was known at the time of his trial that he\n       was taking BuSpar and Desyrel and that these medications could cause serotonin\n       syndrome, this evidence took on \u201cnew significance\u201d once the involuntary\n       intoxication affirmative defense was recognized. Therefore, according to petitioner,\n       once this new affirmative defense became available, the evidence that he was taking\n       Buspar and Desyrel and that he was not warned that taking these medications could\n       have caused him to suffer from serotonin syndrome, became the \u201cnewly discovered\n       evidence\u201d of his actual innocence. Petitioner further contends that, had he asserted\n       this defense at trial, it is more likely than not that the jury would have found that he\n       was involuntarily intoxicated and, therefore, not legally responsible for committing\n\n           4\n             As the State observes, this assertion is contrary to the position petitioner took earlier, when he\n       raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence in a prior successive\n       postconviction petition, alleging that information was available at the time of his trial that the\n       medications he was taking could cause serotonin syndrome. At that time, petitioner argued that the\n       information was evidence of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance for failure to seek a fitness hearing\n       and for failure to seek a second degree murder instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       - 16 -\n\f       first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm\u2014the crimes for which he\n       was convicted.\n\n\u00b6 61        In opposition, the State argues that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s\n       motion for leave to file a successive postconviction petition should be upheld\n       because petitioner has failed to present any newly discovered evidence of actual\n       innocence. The State argues that, even though the affirmative defense of\n       involuntary intoxication based on unwarned side effects of prescribed medication\n       was first recognized by this court in Hari, petitioner still could have argued at his\n       trial that the prescribed medication he was taking caused him to suffer mental status\n       changes that made him unable to understand the criminality of his actions. The State\n       points out that, in People v. Smith, 231 Ill. App. 3d 584 (1992), the trial court\n       permitted the defendant to present an involuntary intoxication defense based on the\n       defendant\u2019s use of a prescribed high dosage of valium. The Smith court noted that\n       several courts in other jurisdictions had held that an involuntary intoxication\n       defense could be based on unwarned side effects from prescribed medication. Thus,\n       the State argues that petitioner is incorrect when he claims that he could not have\n       raised an involuntary intoxication defense at his trial. In addition, the State contends\n       that the lack of precedent for asserting an involuntary intoxication defense should\n       not excuse petitioner\u2019s failure to do so.\n\n\u00b6 62       The State also asks that we reject petitioner\u2019s claim that the \u201cnewly recognized\u201d\n       affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication based on prescribed medication\n       transforms old evidence into the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence\n       necessary for asserting a colorable claim of actual innocence. However, the State\n       also argues that, even if we were to find that a newly available affirmative defense\n       can substitute for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence, petitioner\n       failed to show that this evidence, when considered along with all the evidence\n       presented at trial, would probably have led to a different result.\n\n\u00b6 63        First, we will acknowledge the irregularity of the claim that petitioner has\n       raised. Typically, an actual innocence claim is one in which a postconviction\n       petitioner presents newly discovered evidence persuasively showing that the\n       petitioner did not perform the acts that constitute the crimes for which he was\n       convicted. In other words, it is generally the case that a petitioner seeking leave to\n       file a successive postconviction petition alleging actual innocence brings before the\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f       trial court newly discovered evidence that challenges the physical elements of the\n       charged crimes, that is, the actus reus. For example, a petitioner might produce\n       DNA evidence, unavailable at the time of trial, in an attempt to persuasively show\n       that he was not the person who committed the acts or engaged in the conduct that\n       was attributed to him at trial. Or a petitioner might produce affidavits from new\n       witnesses who were unknown or unavailable at the time of trial and who identify\n       someone else as the perpetrator of the crime or can provide reliable evidence that\n       supports the petitioner\u2019s alibi defense.\n\n\u00b6 64        In situations such as these, our caselaw makes clear that the newly discovered\n       evidence, when viewed in the light of all the evidence produced at trial, must be of\n       such conclusive character that it would probably change the result on retrial. If these\n       elements are shown, the petitioner has produced a colorable claim of actual\n       innocence, which entitles him to bring his successive postconviction petition. The\n       trial court must grant the petitioner leave to file, and the matter will then go forward\n       for additional postconviction proceedings.\n\n\u00b6 65       The case before us does not present a typical actual innocence claim. Here,\n       petitioner does not produce any new evidence to show that he did not commit the\n       \u201cactus reus\u201d or physical elements of the offenses of which he was convicted. In\n       fact, petitioner does not now deny, nor has he ever denied, that he performed the\n       acts that resulted in his convictions for first degree murder and aggravated assault.\n       Instead, petitioner is claiming that newly discovered evidence, i.e., evidence that\n       he was involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medication, persuasively shows that he did not have the requisite mens rea when\n       he committed the crimes for which he was convicted. He further claims that, had\n       he presented this newly discovered \u201cevidence,\u201d it is more likely than not that the\n       jury would have found that he was involuntarily intoxicated and, as a result, he was\n       not legally responsible for the acts he committed because he did not have the\n       necessary mens rea.\n\n\u00b6 66       This is an unusual claim and appears to be one of first impression. Petitioner\n       has directed this court to no cases from any jurisdiction, nor has this court\u2019s research\n       into the matter revealed any such cases, that have held that a newly available\n       defense, which might negate the requisite mens rea element for the offenses\n       charged, may provide the basis for a colorable claim of actual innocence, capable\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f       of being brought under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. However, because the\n       State has not argued that a claim of actual innocence may not be based on evidence\n       that would negate the mens rea, for the purposes of this case we will assume that it\n       is theoretically possible for a petitioner to claim actual innocence by challenging\n       either the actus reus or the mens rea elements. Nevertheless, we find that, in this\n       case, petitioner\u2019s claim does not fit within the framework of a freestanding claim\n       of actual innocence.\n\n\u00b6 67       A freestanding actual innocence claim raised in a successive postconviction\n       petition is an extraordinary remedy. It is a collateral challenge of a conviction based\n       on principles of fundamental fairness and borne out of our constitutional obligation\n       to afford a person who presents new evidence that persuasively indicates that he or\n       she is factually innocent with the additional process necessary to prevent a\n       fundamental miscarriage of justice. Our express reason for allowing a freestanding\n       claim of actual innocence to be cognizable under our Post-Conviction Hearing Act\n       is our firm belief that allowing an innocent person to remain incarcerated would\n       offend all notions of fairness and due process. See Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 488-\n       89.\n\n\u00b6 68        Because a successive postconviction claim of actual innocence undermines the\n       finality of a conviction obtained after a fair trial, a postconviction petitioner seeking\n       to file a claim of actual innocence is held to a high standard. The petitioner must\n       produce newly discovered evidence that was unavailable at the time of trial and\n       could not have been discovered employing due diligence. Also, this new evidence\n       must be of such a conclusive character that it persuasively shows that the petitioner\n       is factually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted and that the evidence,\n       if presented at trial, would exonerate the petitioner.\n\n\u00b6 69       Based on our assumption that it is theoretically possible for petitioner to set\n       forth a colorable claim of actual innocence in a successive postconviction petition\n       asserting that he lacked the requisite mens rea, petitioner would have to produce\n       newly discovered evidence that, when considered along with all the evidence\n       presented at trial, would persuasively show that the petitioner lacked the substantial\n       capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct\n       to the law. Here, petitioner has not met this standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f\u00b6 70       A new defense is a new theory; it is not new evidence. Petitioner presents no\n       newly discovered evidence, whether in the form of witness affidavits or other\n       contemporary documentation, that would persuasively show that, at the time of the\n       shootings, he was involuntarily intoxicated and, therefore, lacked the substantial\n       capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct\n       to the law. The lack of new evidence of involuntary intoxication is particularly\n       striking when considered in the context of the evidence that was offered at trial,\n       including several witnesses who testified that petitioner\u2019s behavior just prior to the\n       shootings was unremarkable and that he was oriented as to time, place, and\n       circumstance. And, while it is true that Dr. Chapman testified at petitioner\u2019s trial\n       that petitioner lacked the substantial capacity to understand the criminality of his\n       conduct, that testimony was based on petitioner\u2019s diagnosed depression, not on\n       petitioner\u2019s claim of innocence based on involuntary intoxication. In addition, Dr.\n       Chapman\u2019s testimony is not new evidence, and his opinion that petitioner lacked\n       the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct was rejected by the jury.\n\n\u00b6 71       Petitioner alleges, however, that it was unknown at the time of trial that the\n       medications he was prescribed could cause \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d and, therefore,\n       his postconviction petition should be allowed to proceed. This argument fails for\n       two reasons. First, petitioner\u2019s allegation that the possible effects of his medication\n       were unknown at the time of trial is directly contradicted by the documentation\n       petitioner submitted in support of his actual innocence claim and is also contrary to\n       the position he took when he raised an ineffective assistance claim in earlier filings.\n\n\u00b6 72       Second, even if we were to accept petitioner\u2019s assertion that it was not known\n       at the time of his trial that serotonin syndrome is a possible side effect of the\n       medications he was prescribed, this is not \u201cnew evidence\u201d of the sort necessary to\n       make a colorable claim of actual innocence because petitioner has presented no\n       evidence which establishes that he was actually suffering from serotonin syndrome\n       when he shot his girlfriend and her mother. To be sure, material referenced in\n       petitioner\u2019s postconviction petition does warn that the medications that were\n       prescribed for petitioner\u2014BuSpar and Desyrel\u2014when taken together, can cause\n       serotonin syndrome. However, the same material does not say that the medications\n       always cause serotonin syndrome. Indeed, the material states that the concomitant\n       use of these two medications should be closely monitored because they (like several\n       other combinations of medication often prescribed for depression) \u201ccan increase\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f       the risk of\u201d serotonin syndrome. Petitioner relies on the mere fact that he was\n       prescribed two medications 5 that could cause serotonin syndrome. He presents no\n       new evidence that would tend to show that he was, in fact, suffering from serotonin\n       syndrome.\n\n\u00b6 73       Accordingly, we find that the information provided by petitioner does not\n       constitute new evidence that persuasively demonstrates that petitioner was\n       suffering from serotonin syndrome at the time the offenses occurred and, as a result,\n       he lacked the substantial capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n       or conform his conduct to the law.\n\n\n\u00b6 74                                          CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 75       We conclude that petitioner has failed to present a colorable claim of actual\n       innocence because he presented no newly discovered evidence that persuasively\n       shows that, at the time he committed the offenses for which he was convicted, he\n       was involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medication and, therefore, was unable to conduct himself in accordance with the\n       law. Accordingly, it was not error for the trial court to deny petitioner leave to file\n       his second successive postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b6 76       Affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 77       JUSTICE CARTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n\n           5\n            It was noted in the background section that petitioner told Chief Bernabei that he filled the\n       prescription Dr. Brady gave him and took some of the medication, though he did not take the\n       medicine as prescribed because one of the medicines bothered his stomach. Thus, petitioner has not\n       even clearly established that he was taking these medications when he shot Wolf and Frasco.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f",

TALIANI, Appellant.\n\n\n                               Opinion filed October 7, 2021.\n\n\n\n        CHIEF JUSTICE ANNE M.

Burke, and Overstreet concurred in\n     the judgment and opinion.\n\n        Justice Carter took no part in the decision.\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\u00b61       After a jury trial in Bureau County, Steven A. Taliani (petitioner) was convicted\n     of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 1992)) and aggravated battery\n     with a firearm (id. \u00a7 12-4.2(a)(1)) in relation to the July 12, 1994, shooting death\n\f     of his girlfriend, Francee Wolf, and the shooting and injury of Wolf\u2019s mother,\n     Clementina Frasco. A direct appeal, two postconviction petitions, and a motion for\n     relief from judgment were all unsuccessful.\n\n\u00b62       At issue now is petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive\n     postconviction petition, in which he asserts that he has set forth a colorable claim\n     of actual innocence based on \u201ca change in the law that allows for a new affirmative\n     defense [which] constitutes newly discovered evidence for purposes of an actual\n     innocence claim.\u201d The circuit court rejected this argument and denied petitioner\n     leave to file his second successive postconviction petition. That ruling was affirmed\n     on appeal. 2020 IL App (3d) 170546. We granted petitioner leave to appeal to this\n     court (Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019)) and now affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial\n     of petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b63                                           BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64       On July 12, 1994, Clementina Frasco arrived home from work around 11 p.m.\n     and found that her 22-year-old daughter, Francee Wolf, was not there. Attempting\n     to locate her daughter, Frasco called one of Wolf\u2019s friends and learned that Wolf\n     was at petitioner\u2019s home. Frasco was aware that petitioner and Wolf had been\n     dating since the summer of 1993 but that Wolf wanted to end her relationship with\n     petitioner because he had become overly possessive and physically abusive. In late\n     December 1993, Cari Carlson, Wolf\u2019s cousin, witnessed petitioner slap, bite, choke,\n     and verbally insult Wolf before throwing Wolf to the ground. Wolf had also\n     confided to her friends that, on one occasion, petitioner admitted to Wolf that he\n     held a shotgun to her head as she slept and told her he had plans to kill her and then\n     commit suicide.\n\n\u00b65       Frasco called petitioner\u2019s home, but petitioner told Frasco that Wolf was not\n     there. Concerned for her daughter\u2019s well-being, Frasco drove to petitioner\u2019s home,\n     knocked on the door, and called out to her daughter. No one answered, but shortly\n     thereafter Frasco heard a loud noise1 come from inside the house. Wolf, dressed\n     only in a pair of silk shorts, then came running out of the house, crying and\n     screaming \u201cPsycho.\u201d Wolf was bleeding, and she told Frasco that petitioner hit her\n\n        1\n            The loud noise was later determined to be the discharge of a shotgun.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f       head. Wolf got into the front passenger side of Frasco\u2019s car, and Frasco attempted\n       to drive away.\n\n\u00b66         Petitioner then ran out of the house, dressed only in a pair of gray boxer shorts,\n       carrying a shotgun. He went to the driver\u2019s side of Frasco\u2019s car and fired a shot\n       through the driver\u2019s side window, attempting to hit Wolf but instead hitting the side\n       of Frasco\u2019s head. Petitioner then walked around to the passenger side, where Wolf\n       was bent over in the front seat with her head down. Petitioner fired a shot through\n       the passenger-side window, striking Wolf in the back, killing her.\n\n\u00b67         Officer Richard Taylor, who was patrolling in the area, heard the shots and\n       arrived on the scene as Frasco\u2019s car rolled into the street, jumped the curb, and came\n       to a stop. Frasco was screaming, \u201cHelp, we\u2019ve been shot.\u201d Officer Taylor radioed\n       for an ambulance as he went to the car to check on the occupants. When Taylor\n       checked on Frasco, she identified petitioner as the person who shot her and her\n       daughter.\n\n\u00b68         Officer Taylor then noticed a man, dressed only in boxer shorts, get into a black\n       car and drive off at a high rate of speed. Taylor radioed his partner, Officer Kevin\n       Sangston, who pursued the fleeing car and, ultimately, apprehended and arrested\n       petitioner.\n\n\u00b69        On August 9, 1994, petitioner was indicted on charges of first degree murder\n       and aggravated battery with a firearm. Appointed counsel moved to have petitioner\n       examined for fitness to stand trial and evaluated regarding his mental status at the\n       time of the shootings. The trial court granted the motion. However, before petitioner\n       was examined for fitness, he obtained new defense counsel, who withdrew the\n       motion and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. A psychiatrist, Dr.\n       Robert E. Chapman, was retained to examine petitioner and evaluate whether he\n       was sane at the time of the shootings.\n\n\u00b6 10       Later that year, petitioner was tried before a jury. At trial, the State presented\n       extensive testimony from numerous witnesses regarding petitioner\u2019s behavior in\n       the weeks and hours before the shootings. Several of Wolf\u2019s friends testified that,\n       during the three weeks prior to the shooting, petitioner had become increasingly\n       jealous about a perceived sexual relationship between Wolf and a man named\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       Kevin Trovero. Witness testimony also provided a timeline of petitioner\u2019s activity\n       on Tuesday, July 12, 1994, the day of the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 11       Testimony revealed that petitioner began the day by going to work at the\n       jewelry store he owned. He had lunch with Marlo Capponi, whom he had been\n       dating since January 1994. 2 Petitioner and Capponi made plans to get together later\n       that evening. After lunch, petitioner went back to the jewelry shop, where he stayed\n       until he closed around 7 p.m. As petitioner was driving home, he saw a friend,\n       Michelle Castelli, driving her car. While the two cars were stopped at a traffic light,\n       they arranged to meet around 7:30 p.m. at a bar named Ellie\u2019s Tap. Castelli testified\n       that, at Ellie\u2019s, petitioner told her that he loved Wolf but that he was concerned she\n       might be seeing another man (Trovero). Castelli testified that she knew petitioner\n       well and, although he expressed concern about Wolf, he appeared to be his normal\n       self and did not appear to be under the influence of either drugs or alcohol.\n\n\u00b6 12       The bartender at Ellie\u2019s testified that he had known petitioner for eight years\n       and, on the night of the shootings, he saw petitioner come into the bar and have\n       three or four beers. He said petitioner \u201cacted normally\u201d and looked \u201ctotally sober\u201d\n       when he left the bar around 8:30 p.m.\n\n\u00b6 13       After leaving Ellie\u2019s bar, petitioner went to Verucchi\u2019s Bar and Restaurant.\n       Arthur Verucchi was working that night, and he testified that petitioner arrived\n       around 9:30 p.m. and stayed at the bar for 30 to 45 minutes. During that time,\n       petitioner had one vodka and water. Verucchi said petitioner did not act strangely\n       or appear disoriented or confused, nor did he seem to be under the influence of\n       alcohol or drugs. Two other bar patrons at Verucchi\u2019s that night confirmed Arthur\u2019s\n       testimony. After leaving Verucchi\u2019s, petitioner went home, intending to meet with\n       Capponi later on. But when he arrived home, Wolf was there.\n\n\u00b6 14      Kevin Trovero testified that, at about 11:15 p.m., petitioner phoned his home.\n       His wife answered the phone, and he got on another extension. Petitioner asked\n       Trovero\u2019s wife if she knew her husband was dating Wolf. Kevin then spoke up,\n\n           2\n             Capponi testified that she had \u201cheard rumors\u201d that petitioner was also dating Wolf. However,\n       she said petitioner denied it when she asked him about Wolf. After his arrest, Capponi regularly\n       visited petitioner in jail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -4-\n\f       denying petitioner\u2019s accusations. Both Kevin and his wife testified that, although\n       petitioner was accusatory and angry, he seemed in control of his faculties and was\n       not ranting or incoherent. After this phone call, petitioner and Wolf argued. Then\n       Frasco arrived at petitioner\u2019s home, and the shootings occurred as detailed above.\n\n\u00b6 15       At trial, Officer Sangston testified that, just after midnight, in the early morning\n       on July 13, 1994, he received instructions from Officer Taylor to apprehend the\n       driver of a black car with license plate A-U-S-T-N-T. Soon after receiving the radio\n       message, Sangston observed the vehicle and activated his lights. The car sped away,\n       and Sangston pursued with lights and siren on. The black vehicle continued without\n       stopping, passing several stop signs, then turned onto Route 6 and sped up, traveling\n       at approximately 75 miles per hour. When the vehicle traveled through an area\n       known as \u201cthe curves,\u201d which was under construction, the driver hit some\n       construction barrels, lost control, and crashed into the guardrail.\n\n\u00b6 16       Because Officer Sangston was told the driver could be armed, he drew his gun\n       and situated himself behind the door of his police car. The driver got out of his\n       vehicle and started walking slowly toward Sangston with his hands up. Petitioner\n       said, \u201cI\u2019m all out of shells.\u201d Sangston recognized the driver as petitioner from\n       previous encounters and ordered him to get down on the ground. Petitioner\n       disobeyed Sangston\u2019s command and, instead, continued to walk slowly toward\n       Sangston, saying \u201cShoot me, please shoot me.\u201d Sangston responded, \u201cSteve, just\n       get on the ground, we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d But petitioner continued to walk slowly\n       toward Sangston and said, \u201cThere is nothing to talk about. I have nothing left to\n       live for. Shoot me.\u201d Petitioner also threatened to take Sangston\u2019s gun away from\n       him and shoot himself.\n\n\u00b6 17       When petitioner got closer, Sangston holstered his gun and pepper sprayed\n       petitioner. Petitioner was then handcuffed and placed in Sangston\u2019s police car.\n       Once petitioner was secured, Sangston went to petitioner\u2019s vehicle and recovered a\n       double-barrel, sawed-off 20-gauge shotgun from the passenger-side floor.\n       Petitioner and the gun were transported to the police station.\n\n\u00b6 18       While being transported, petitioner said, \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d\n       and \u201cWhy the hell does she have to show up, we had everything worked out.\u201d At\n       the police station, petitioner continued to ask for someone to shoot him until\n       Sangston moved him to where he was to be interviewed. At that point, petitioner\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d Sangston replied that someone would be in to question\n       him. Petitioner then commented, \u201cHell of a way to get a DUI.\u201d Sangston testified\n       that, until then, there had been no mention of alcohol consumption or \u201cDUI\u201d by\n       anyone and that he saw no evidence that petitioner was under the influence of\n       \u201canything.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 19       Sangston stayed with petitioner while he waited to be interviewed. During this\n       time, petitioner apologized to Sangston for \u201cputting him through all this.\u201d Sangston\n       testified that, based on his observations of petitioner and their conversations, he\n       believed that petitioner was oriented as to time, place, and circumstance;\n       understood the criminality of his earlier conduct; and knew right from wrong.\n\n\u00b6 20       At the Spring Valley Police Department, in the early morning hours of July 13,\n       1994, petitioner was interviewed by Spring Valley police chief Doug Bernabei, who\n       was accompanied by Mike Miroux, an investigator for the Bureau County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department. Both Chief Bernabei and Miroux testified at trial, providing similar\n       accounts of the interview with petitioner, which took place from approximately 1\n       a.m. until 2:45 a.m. After petitioner was advised of his rights, he signed a waiver\n       and agreed to speak with them. Petitioner also signed a consent form, allowing the\n       police to enter his house to search it.\n\n\u00b6 21       Chief Bernabei testified that, during the interview, petitioner gave three\n       different statements. Initially, petitioner told Chief Bernabei and Miroux that he\n       remembered going to Verucchi\u2019s that night and leaving there at about 9:30 p.m. but\n       that he had no recollection of the rest of the evening until he was arrested by Officer\n       Sangston.\n\n\u00b6 22        Chief Bernabei testified that he asked petitioner to tell him everything he had\n       done since the previous Friday. In response, petitioner related the events of the\n       weekend and then continued on through Tuesday, the day of the shooting. This\n       time, petitioner said that, when he got home from Verucchi\u2019s, Wolf was at his\n       house. Petitioner remembered that Wolf got angry and they argued. He said Wolf\n       left his house and then stood outside screaming obscenities at him. Petitioner told\n       them he locked the door so Wolf could not get back inside but that then Wolf drove\n       away in her car and petitioner decided to go after her. Petitioner said he got in his\n       car and started driving around, trying to find Wolf. While searching for Wolf,\n       petitioner said he was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f\u00b6 23      Chief Bernabei testified that he then asked petitioner about the sawed-off\n       shotgun that was found in his car. Bernabei testified that, initially, petitioner denied\n       he had a gun in his car. Later, however, petitioner put his head in his hands, got\n       very \u201csomber,\u201d and said he would tell Bernabei \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24       In this third statement, petitioner told Chief Bernabei and Miroux that Wolf was\n       at his house when he got home from Verucchi\u2019s. Petitioner told them he and Wolf\n       had consensual sexual relations. Afterward, however, they got into an argument\n       because he was dating Marlo Capponi and he accused Wolf of dating Trovero.\n       Petitioner said that Wolf became angry because he called Trovero on the phone.\n       Petitioner then claimed that he thought Wolf was reaching for his shotgun, which\n       she knew he kept under his bed. Instead, petitioner got the gun, and when Wolf\n       taunted him, he fired two shots in the bedroom. Wolf then ran out of his house\n       screaming, \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 25       Petitioner told Chief Bernabei that, when Wolf ran out of the house, he got two\n       shells from his dresser drawer and reloaded his double-barrel shotgun. Then he ran\n       after Wolf. Petitioner told Chief Bernabei he saw Wolf in his yard, standing near a\n       tree, and that he shot at her to scare her so she would go back in the house where\n       he planned to kill her according to \u201chis plan.\u201d Although petitioner did not say\n       anything about Frasco, he admitted that he saw Wolf get into a car and that he fired\n       the shotgun at Wolf through the driver\u2019s side window because he wanted to kill\n       Wolf. Petitioner also admitted that he knew he was not arrested for driving under\n       the influence.\n\n\u00b6 26       Around 3 a.m., the officers who searched petitioner\u2019s house brought to the\n       station a typewritten letter they found in the kitchen of petitioner\u2019s home and a\n       typewritten note that had been attached to the door of petitioner\u2019s home. After\n       obtaining these documents, Chief Bernabei questioned petitioner a second time. He\n       showed the documents to petitioner, who explained that he had written out the note\n       and letter a few weeks earlier and then typed them, using the typewriter at the\n       jewelry store he owned. Chief Bernabei asked petitioner to sign and date the pages\n       of the letter as they reviewed it together.\n\n\u00b6 27      Petitioner explained to Chief Bernabei that he had been thinking about killing\n       Wolf for a long time and that he had a plan, which he claimed to have discussed\n       with Wolf. The plan was to kill Wolf at his home and then commit suicide so they\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       could be together forever. Petitioner also told Chief Bernabei that, a few weeks\n       earlier, he told his sister-in-law that he was depressed and thinking of committing\n       suicide. She told him to get help, and petitioner\u2019s brother came to petitioner\u2019s house\n       and took his shotgun away. Petitioner then made an appointment to see a\n       psychiatrist, Dr. Brady. Petitioner said he kept the appointment, which lasted about\n       two hours, but he did not feel any better after talking to the doctor. Petitioner also\n       admitted to Chief Bernabei that, even though he had decided to kill Wolf and\n       commit suicide prior to his appointment with Dr. Brady, he did not tell Dr. Brady\n       his plan. Instead, immediately after the appointment, he went to his store to type\n       the documents regarding his murder-suicide plan. Later on, he retrieved the shotgun\n       from his brother\u2019s house.\n\n\u00b6 28      Petitioner told Chief Bernabei that Dr. Brady prescribed two medications for\n       him\u2014one was to be taken three times a day, the other once at night. When Chief\n       Bernabei asked petitioner if he took the medicine, petitioner said that he did, but\n       not as directed. He said that he skipped doses of the one medication he was\n       supposed to take three times a day because it bothered his stomach.\n\n\u00b6 29      The typewritten note and letter written by petitioner were offered into evidence.\n       The note, which had been posted to the front door of petitioner\u2019s home, stated:\n\n           \u201cDO NOT COME IN ALONE!!!!!!!! WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND\n           INSIDE MAY NOT BE APPEALING. I AM VERY SORRY. ITS OK.\n           BEFORE YOU GO ANY FARTHER READ THE LETTER ON THE TABLE.\n           THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN SOME. ITS OK. I\u2019M NOT AFRAID\n           ANYMORE.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30       The three-page letter addressed to \u201cChuck and Julie,\u201d which petitioner signed\n       and dated as he reviewed it with Chief Bernabei, had been found inside the home,\n       on the kitchen table. In this letter, petitioner left detailed instructions regarding the\n       distribution of his belongings and the handling of his business affairs. The\n       following statement was also in the letter: \u201cI can\u2019t have Francee do this to anyone\n       else especially me. Try to keep us together if you can.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 31       After the State rested, defense counsel called two psychiatrists to testify for the\n       defense: Dr. Richard Brady, who had been petitioner\u2019s treating psychiatrist, and Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       Robert Chapman, who had examined petitioner after the shootings and was called\n       as an expert witness regarding petitioner\u2019s sanity at the time of the shootings.\n\n\u00b6 32       Dr. Brady testified that he saw petitioner in his office on June 27, 1994,\n       approximately two weeks prior to the shootings. During the appointment, petitioner\n       reported that he was feeling depressed and had had suicidal thoughts \u201cthe weekend\n       before last.\u201d Dr. Brady said that petitioner assured him that he was not having any\n       suicidal or homicidal thoughts at that time and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d harm himself or\n       others. Dr. Brady further testified that he diagnosed petitioner with \u201crecurrent major\n       depressive disorder,\u201d general anxiety, and alcohol dependence. He prescribed two\n       medications for depression, BuSpar and Desyrel, and recommended that petitioner\n       obtain individual therapy. An appointment was made for July 11, but petitioner did\n       not show up for that appointment.\n\n\u00b6 33        Dr. Chapman, the psychiatrist retained by defense counsel, testified that he had\n       examined petitioner on September 1, 1994, approximately nine weeks after the\n       shootings. His diagnosis, after evaluating petitioner and reading \u201call of the official\n       reports,\u201d was that petitioner suffered from major affective disorder, obsessive-\n       compulsive disorder, and depression with suicidal ideation. Dr. Chapman reported\n       that petitioner had a high risk of suicide and apparently attempted to commit suicide\n       at least once while he was awaiting trial. 3\n\n\u00b6 34       Dr. Chapman also testified that, during the examination, petitioner appeared\n       anxious, \u201cquite confused, disorganized, and prone to intense feelings of panic.\u201d\n       Additionally, Dr. Chapman testified that petitioner reported feeling as if he was\n       \u201closing his mind\u201d and having \u201cbizarre and unusual sensory experiences and\n       confused thinking.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 35       Although Dr. Chapman was aware that petitioner had taken the medications\n       BuSpar and Desyrel, prescribed by Dr. Brady, he made no correlation between\n       petitioner\u2019s mental status at the time of the shootings and the medications he was\n       prescribed. Dr. Chapman testified that petitioner\u2019s depression had \u201csubstantially\n       impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his behavior.\u201d On cross-\n\n\n           3\n            One of the guards testified that the suicide attempt did not appear to be serious. Petitioner used\n       a broken piece of plastic to cut his wrist. There was very little blood, and petitioner did not need to\n       be hospitalized.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f       examination, Chapman emphasized, \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was unable [to appreciate the\n       criminality of his behavior], I said he was substantially impaired.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 36       After hearing all the evidence, the jury rejected the insanity defense and found\n       petitioner guilty of both first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm.\n       The trial court sentenced petitioner to an extended term of 70 years\u2019 incarceration\n       for first degree murder and a consecutive term of 30 years for aggravated battery\n       with a firearm, for a total sentence of 100 years.\n\n\u00b6 37       In his direct appeal, petitioner argued that his sentence was excessive and that\n       the trial court should have entered a directed verdict of not guilty by reason of\n       insanity because the evidence proved that he was legally insane at the time of the\n       shooting. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentence (People v.\n       Taliani, No. 3-94-0921 (1995) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court\n       Rule 23)), and this court denied his petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 38       In 1996, petitioner filed pro se a postconviction petition alleging that his trial\n       counsel and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance. Petitioner cited 17\n       separate errors by trial counsel, including counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to\n       suppress petitioner\u2019s confession. Petitioner also made six claims of ineffective\n       assistance of appellate counsel. The trial court dismissed this postconviction\n       petition at the first stage, and the appellate court affirmed. People v. Taliani, No. 3-\n       96-0672 (1997) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23). This\n       court denied the petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 39       In 2000, Taliani filed pro se a motion for relief from judgment, claiming in part\n       that he should receive a new trial because a State witness had testified in a civil suit\n       that petitioner\u2019s shooting of Frasco was accidental. Petitioner later amended the\n       motion to add an Apprendi claim (see Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n       (2000)). The trial court denied the motion, and the appellate court affirmed. People\n       v. Taliani, No. 3-00-0913 (2003) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court\n       Rule 23). We denied leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 40       In 2002, while the appeal of his 2000 motion was still pending, petitioner filed\n       a second petition for relief from judgment, alleging that Dr. Brady, one of the\n       psychiatrists who had testified at his trial, had been convicted of practicing\n       medicine without a license. Petitioner later amended his motion with several\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       additional claims and accompanying documentation. This motion was treated as a\n       successive postconviction petition, and in 2003, the trial court appointed the public\n       defender to represent petitioner.\n\n\u00b6 41       Several months later, petitioner successfully moved to replace the public\n       defender with retained counsel. After a number of additional motions were ruled\n       on, defense counsel filed an amended successive postconviction petition in 2014.\n       In this amended petition it was alleged that defense counsel knew at the time of trial\n       that petitioner was taking BuSpar and Desyrel, medications that Dr. Brady had\n       prescribed, and that there was medical information at the time of trial that indicated\n       this combination of medications \u201ccan lead to a serious condition known as\n       \u2018serotonin syndrome\u2019 \u201d that can cause \u201cirritability, altered consciousness,\n       confusion, hallucination, coma,\u201d and \u201csuicidal thoughts.\u201d It was claimed in the\n       amended petition that trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by\n       withdrawing the petition for a fitness hearing and by failing to seek a second degree\n       murder instruction based on the prescribed medication he was taking. In support of\n       this ineffectiveness claim, petitioner attached to the petition various medical\n       articles about serotonin syndrome, which had been published prior to petitioner\u2019s\n       1994 trial and, therefore, would have been available to trial counsel.\n\n\u00b6 42       The trial court dismissed the successive petition, finding that petitioner failed\n       to show cause and prejudice and, therefore, the claims were barred by res judicata\n       because petitioner could have raised them in his first postconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 43       Petitioner appealed the dismissal, arguing that he had met the cause and\n       prejudice standard to file a successive petition on his ineffective assistance claims.\n       Petitioner also alleged that he did not need to show cause and prejudice regarding\n       his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to proffer a jury instruction\n       on second degree murder because this claim was an actual innocence claim.\n       Although petitioner admitted that he did not meet the general requirements for\n       proving an actual innocence claim, he argued that he did not need to do so because\n       he was only claiming to be \u201cactually innocent\u201d of \u201ca certain classification of\n       crimes,\u201d i.e., first degree murder. Petitioner explained his argument in this way\u2014\n       if a second degree murder instruction had been given to the jury, he would have\n       been found guilty of second degree murder and, therefore, he would have been\n       \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crime of first degree murder, for which he was convicted.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f\u00b6 44       The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the successive petition, finding\n       that the ineffectiveness claims could have been raised in his initial petition and\n       failed to meet the cause and prejudice test. The court also found that petitioner\u2019s\n       alleged \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim \u201cdefies logic and finds no support in Illinois law.\u201d\n       People v. Taliani, 2016 IL App (3d) 150478-U, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 45       In 2017, petitioner filed, pro se, a motion seeking leave to file a second\n       successive postconviction petition, which is the subject of the appeal now before\n       this court. Petitioner contended in the circuit court that he should be allowed to file\n       this successive petition because his claim is one of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d More\n       specifically, petitioner alleged that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which\n       he was convicted because, at the time he committed those offenses, he was\n       involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medications, BuSpar and Desyrel, which caused him to suffer from serotonin\n       syndrome. Petitioner attached some of the same literature on serotonin syndrome\n       that he had attached to his earlier postconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 46       Petitioner acknowledged in the circuit court that an actual innocence claim must\n       be supported by \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d and that the evidence that he took\n       prescription medications that could cause serotonin syndrome was not \u201cnewly\n       discovered.\u201d He argued, nonetheless, that the affirmative defense of involuntary\n       intoxication based on unwarned side effects from prescription medication was not\n       recognized in Illinois until long after his trial, when People v. Hari, 218 Ill. 2d 275\n       (2006), was decided. Petitioner claimed that this newly available affirmative\n       defense constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d for purposes of his actual\n       innocence claim. Petitioner further argued that it was more likely than not that, had\n       he been able to raise this affirmative defense at the time of his trial, the jury would\n       have found that he was involuntarily intoxicated and, as a result, he would have\n       been found not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted.\n\n\u00b6 47       The circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file his successive\n       postconviction petition and dismissed the petition, holding that petitioner failed to\n       present a colorable claim of actual innocence because he failed to establish with\n       any reasonable degree of certainty that no reasonable juror would have convicted\n       him had the jury considered the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication due\n       to unwarned side effects of prescribed medication.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 48       Petitioner appealed, and a majority of the appellate court affirmed the circuit\n       court. 2020 IL App (3d) 170546. The majority, while questioning whether it was\n       even proper to permit a newly available affirmative defense to serve as the newly\n       discovered evidence element of an actual innocence claim, went on to hold that \u201cthe\n       allegations and supporting documentation did not show that these alleged side\n       effects rendered defendant intoxicated to the degree that he lacked substantial\n       capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\n       conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u00b6 27.\n       Justice McDade dissented and would have found that petitioner set forth a colorable\n       claim of actual innocence. Id. \u00b6 36 (McDade, J., dissenting).\n\n\u00b6 49      We granted petitioner leave to appeal to this court.\n\n\n\u00b6 50                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 51       The single issue before us is whether the trial court erred when it denied\n       petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive postconviction petition.\n       Petitioner contends that leave should have been granted because he presented a\n       colorable claim of actual innocence.\n\n\u00b6 52       Where, as here, a petitioner raises an actual innocence claim in a successive\n       postconviction petition, the trial court should deny leave only where, as a matter of\n       law, no colorable claim of actual innocence has been presented. People v. Edwards,\n       2012 IL 111711, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33. Since this is a legal question, we review de novo the\n       circuit court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file his successive\n       postconviction petition. People v. Robinson, 2020 IL 123849, \u00b6 40.\n\n\u00b6 53       The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (West\n       2016)) provides a statutory remedy to criminal defendants who claim that\n       substantial violations of their constitutional rights occurred at trial. Edwards, 2012\n       IL 111711, \u00b6 21. Because a postconviction petition is a collateral attack on the\n       judgment, issues that were raised and decided on direct appeal are barred from\n       consideration by the doctrine of res judicata, while issues that could have been\n       raised, but were not, are forfeited. People v. Holman, 2017 IL 120655, \u00b6 25. In\n       addition to this procedural default rule, both the Act and our caselaw make clear\n       that the filing of only one postconviction proceeding is contemplated.

Coleman, 2013 IL\n       113307, \u00b6 81, quoting People v. Pitsonbarger, 205 Ill. 2d 444, 458 (2002)); see also\n       Edwards, 2012 IL 111711, \u00b6 23; People v.

Washington, 171 Ill. 2d 475, 488 (1996).\n\n\u00b6 55       In Illinois, we have recognized only two exceptions where \u201cfundamental\n       fairness\u201d compels the bar against successive petitions to be lifted. Coleman, 2013\n       IL 113307, \u00b6 82. The first is the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception, which has been\n       codified in the Act. See 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (West 2016). The second is the\n       \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d exception, which requires a petitioner to make\n       a persuasive showing of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d See Coleman, 2013 IL 113307, \u00b6 83;\n       Edwards, 2012 IL 111711, \u00b6 23; Ortiz, 235 Ill. 2d at 329.\n\n\u00b6 56        In Washington, we were tasked with deciding whether a \u201cfree standing\u201d claim\n       of actual innocence based on new evidence could be raised in a petition under the\n       Act. We explained that a \u201cfree standing\u201d claim of actual innocence is one in which\n       newly discovered evidence is not being used to supplement an assertion of a\n       constitutional violation with respect to the defendant\u2019s trial or that the evidence at\n       trial was insufficient to convict the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 479-80. Rather, a \u201cfree standing\u201d claim of actual\n       innocence is one in which newly discovered evidence makes a persuasive showing\n       that the petitioner did not commit the charged offense and was, therefore,\n       wrongfully convicted. Id. at 489.\n\n\u00b6 57       Since postconviction relief is unavailable if no constitutional right is implicated\n       in the asserted claim, we considered in Washington whether, as a matter of\n       procedural or substantive due process, additional process should be afforded a\n       petitioner when newly discovered evidence indicates that the convicted petitioner\n       is actually innocent. Id. at 486-87. We found that there was footing in the due\n       process clause of our Illinois Constitution for asserting freestanding innocence\n       claims based upon newly discovered evidence. Id. at 489. We reasoned that\n       imprisonment of the innocent would be so conscience shocking as to trigger\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f       operation of substantive due process. Id. at 487-88. Thus, we held that, \u201cas a matter\n       of Illinois constitutional jurisprudence,\u201d a claim of newly discovered evidence that\n       makes a persuasive showing that the petitioner is factually innocent of the crime\n       for which he was convicted is cognizable under the Act as a matter of due process.\n       Id. at 489.\n\n\u00b6 58        Procedurally, a petitioner who claims actual innocence in a successive\n       postconviction petition must first obtain leave of court to file the petition. Id.;\n       People v. Wrice, 2012 IL 111860, \u00b6 47; 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (West 2016).\n       Substantively, however, a petitioner need not show cause and prejudice (Ortiz, 235\n       Ill. 2d at 330) but must support his claim of actual innocence with evidence that is\n       \u201cnewly discovered, material and not merely cumulative, and of such conclusive\n       character that it would probably change the result on retrial\u201d (id. at 333 (where a\n       defendant sets forth a claim of actual innocence in a successive postconviction\n       petition, the defendant is excused from showing cause and prejudice and, instead,\n       must meet the Washington standard)). Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 496; see also\n       People v. Morgan, 212 Ill. 2d 148, 154 (2004) (because conviction of an innocent\n       person would violate the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution, we have\n       recognized that postconviction petitioners have the right \u201cto assert a claim of actual\n       innocence based on newly discovered evidence\u201d); People v.

Delo, 513 U.S. 298,\n       327 (1995)). We made it clear in Coleman that the standard set forth in Edwards,\n       and our holding in Ortiz that actual innocence claims need not show cause and\n       prejudice, did not alter the requirements for filing an actual innocence claim in a\n       successive postconviction petition. See Coleman, 2013 IL 113307, \u00b6 93. We stated,\n       \u201cOur commitment to [the Washington standard] is unwavering. We have not diluted\n       the substantive standard for actual-innocence claims, as the State thinks we did in\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f       Ortiz. And we have not strengthened that standard, as the State hopes we did in\n       Edwards.\u201d Id. Thus, the Edwards standard is merely a restatement of the well-\n       established rule that, to set forth a colorable claim of actual innocence in a\n       successive postconviction petition, the petitioner must produce newly discovered\n       evidence that, when considered along with all the evidence presented at trial, would\n       probably lead to a different result on retrial. Id. \u00b6 96; Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 489.\n\n\u00b6 60        Petitioner contends that he has met all the requirements for setting forth a\n       colorable claim of actual innocence. He concedes that it was known at the time of\n       his trial that he was taking the prescribed medications, BuSpar and Desyrel, when\n       he committed the offenses for which he was convicted and, therefore, this is not\n       newly discovered evidence. However, petitioner argues that it was not known at the\n       time of his trial that these two medications, taken together, could cause serotonin\n       syndrome, a condition that may bring about mental status changes such as\n       heightened irritability, altered consciousness, and confusion. Petitioner claims this\n       information was only developed in the last several years. 4 However, he goes on to\n       argue that, even if this information had been available at the time of his trial, he\n       could not have raised the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication due to\n       unwarned side effects from prescription medication because that affirmative\n       defense was not recognized until this court\u2019s decision in Hari, 218 Ill. 2d 275. Thus,\n       it is petitioner\u2019s position that, although it was known at the time of his trial that he\n       was taking BuSpar and Desyrel and that these medications could cause serotonin\n       syndrome, this evidence took on \u201cnew significance\u201d once the involuntary\n       intoxication affirmative defense was recognized. Therefore, according to petitioner,\n       once this new affirmative defense became available, the evidence that he was taking\n       Buspar and Desyrel and that he was not warned that taking these medications could\n       have caused him to suffer from serotonin syndrome, became the \u201cnewly discovered\n       evidence\u201d of his actual innocence. Petitioner further contends that, had he asserted\n       this defense at trial, it is more likely than not that the jury would have found that he\n       was involuntarily intoxicated and, therefore, not legally responsible for committing\n\n           4\n             As the State observes, this assertion is contrary to the position petitioner took earlier, when he\n       raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence in a prior successive\n       postconviction petition, alleging that information was available at the time of his trial that the\n       medications he was taking could cause serotonin syndrome. At that time, petitioner argued that the\n       information was evidence of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance for failure to seek a fitness hearing\n       and for failure to seek a second degree murder instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       - 16 -\n\f       first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm\u2014the crimes for which he\n       was convicted.\n\n\u00b6 61        In opposition, the State argues that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s\n       motion for leave to file a successive postconviction petition should be upheld\n       because petitioner has failed to present any newly discovered evidence of actual\n       innocence. The State argues that, even though the affirmative defense of\n       involuntary intoxication based on unwarned side effects of prescribed medication\n       was first recognized by this court in Hari, petitioner still could have argued at his\n       trial that the prescribed medication he was taking caused him to suffer mental status\n       changes that made him unable to understand the criminality of his actions. The State\n       points out that, in People v. Smith, 231 Ill. App. 3d 584 (1992), the trial court\n       permitted the defendant to present an involuntary intoxication defense based on the\n       defendant\u2019s use of a prescribed high dosage of valium. The Smith court noted that\n       several courts in other jurisdictions had held that an involuntary intoxication\n       defense could be based on unwarned side effects from prescribed medication. Thus,\n       the State argues that petitioner is incorrect when he claims that he could not have\n       raised an involuntary intoxication defense at his trial. In addition, the State contends\n       that the lack of precedent for asserting an involuntary intoxication defense should\n       not excuse petitioner\u2019s failure to do so.\n\n\u00b6 62       The State also asks that we reject petitioner\u2019s claim that the \u201cnewly recognized\u201d\n       affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication based on prescribed medication\n       transforms old evidence into the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence\n       necessary for asserting a colorable claim of actual innocence. However, the State\n       also argues that, even if we were to find that a newly available affirmative defense\n       can substitute for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence, petitioner\n       failed to show that this evidence, when considered along with all the evidence\n       presented at trial, would probably have led to a different result.\n\n\u00b6 63        First, we will acknowledge the irregularity of the claim that petitioner has\n       raised. Typically, an actual innocence claim is one in which a postconviction\n       petitioner presents newly discovered evidence persuasively showing that the\n       petitioner did not perform the acts that constitute the crimes for which he was\n       convicted. In other words, it is generally the case that a petitioner seeking leave to\n       file a successive postconviction petition alleging actual innocence brings before the\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f       trial court newly discovered evidence that challenges the physical elements of the\n       charged crimes, that is, the actus reus. For example, a petitioner might produce\n       DNA evidence, unavailable at the time of trial, in an attempt to persuasively show\n       that he was not the person who committed the acts or engaged in the conduct that\n       was attributed to him at trial. Or a petitioner might produce affidavits from new\n       witnesses who were unknown or unavailable at the time of trial and who identify\n       someone else as the perpetrator of the crime or can provide reliable evidence that\n       supports the petitioner\u2019s alibi defense.\n\n\u00b6 64        In situations such as these, our caselaw makes clear that the newly discovered\n       evidence, when viewed in the light of all the evidence produced at trial, must be of\n       such conclusive character that it would probably change the result on retrial. If these\n       elements are shown, the petitioner has produced a colorable claim of actual\n       innocence, which entitles him to bring his successive postconviction petition. The\n       trial court must grant the petitioner leave to file, and the matter will then go forward\n       for additional postconviction proceedings.\n\n\u00b6 65       The case before us does not present a typical actual innocence claim. Here,\n       petitioner does not produce any new evidence to show that he did not commit the\n       \u201cactus reus\u201d or physical elements of the offenses of which he was convicted. In\n       fact, petitioner does not now deny, nor has he ever denied, that he performed the\n       acts that resulted in his convictions for first degree murder and aggravated assault.\n       Instead, petitioner is claiming that newly discovered evidence, i.e., evidence that\n       he was involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medication, persuasively shows that he did not have the requisite mens rea when\n       he committed the crimes for which he was convicted. He further claims that, had\n       he presented this newly discovered \u201cevidence,\u201d it is more likely than not that the\n       jury would have found that he was involuntarily intoxicated and, as a result, he was\n       not legally responsible for the acts he committed because he did not have the\n       necessary mens rea.\n\n\u00b6 66       This is an unusual claim and appears to be one of first impression. Petitioner\n       has directed this court to no cases from any jurisdiction, nor has this court\u2019s research\n       into the matter revealed any such cases, that have held that a newly available\n       defense, which might negate the requisite mens rea element for the offenses\n       charged, may provide the basis for a colorable claim of actual innocence, capable\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f       of being brought under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. However, because the\n       State has not argued that a claim of actual innocence may not be based on evidence\n       that would negate the mens rea, for the purposes of this case we will assume that it\n       is theoretically possible for a petitioner to claim actual innocence by challenging\n       either the actus reus or the mens rea elements. Nevertheless, we find that, in this\n       case, petitioner\u2019s claim does not fit within the framework of a freestanding claim\n       of actual innocence.\n\n\u00b6 67       A freestanding actual innocence claim raised in a successive postconviction\n       petition is an extraordinary remedy. It is a collateral challenge of a conviction based\n       on principles of fundamental fairness and borne out of our constitutional obligation\n       to afford a person who presents new evidence that persuasively indicates that he or\n       she is factually innocent with the additional process necessary to prevent a\n       fundamental miscarriage of justice. Our express reason for allowing a freestanding\n       claim of actual innocence to be cognizable under our Post-Conviction Hearing Act\n       is our firm belief that allowing an innocent person to remain incarcerated would\n       offend all notions of fairness and due process. See Washington, 171 Ill. 2d at 488-\n       89.\n\n\u00b6 68        Because a successive postconviction claim of actual innocence undermines the\n       finality of a conviction obtained after a fair trial, a postconviction petitioner seeking\n       to file a claim of actual innocence is held to a high standard. The petitioner must\n       produce newly discovered evidence that was unavailable at the time of trial and\n       could not have been discovered employing due diligence. Also, this new evidence\n       must be of such a conclusive character that it persuasively shows that the petitioner\n       is factually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted and that the evidence,\n       if presented at trial, would exonerate the petitioner.\n\n\u00b6 69       Based on our assumption that it is theoretically possible for petitioner to set\n       forth a colorable claim of actual innocence in a successive postconviction petition\n       asserting that he lacked the requisite mens rea, petitioner would have to produce\n       newly discovered evidence that, when considered along with all the evidence\n       presented at trial, would persuasively show that the petitioner lacked the substantial\n       capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct\n       to the law. Here, petitioner has not met this standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f\u00b6 70       A new defense is a new theory; it is not new evidence. Petitioner presents no\n       newly discovered evidence, whether in the form of witness affidavits or other\n       contemporary documentation, that would persuasively show that, at the time of the\n       shootings, he was involuntarily intoxicated and, therefore, lacked the substantial\n       capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct\n       to the law. The lack of new evidence of involuntary intoxication is particularly\n       striking when considered in the context of the evidence that was offered at trial,\n       including several witnesses who testified that petitioner\u2019s behavior just prior to the\n       shootings was unremarkable and that he was oriented as to time, place, and\n       circumstance. And, while it is true that Dr. Chapman testified at petitioner\u2019s trial\n       that petitioner lacked the substantial capacity to understand the criminality of his\n       conduct, that testimony was based on petitioner\u2019s diagnosed depression, not on\n       petitioner\u2019s claim of innocence based on involuntary intoxication. In addition, Dr.\n       Chapman\u2019s testimony is not new evidence, and his opinion that petitioner lacked\n       the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct was rejected by the jury.\n\n\u00b6 71       Petitioner alleges, however, that it was unknown at the time of trial that the\n       medications he was prescribed could cause \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d and, therefore,\n       his postconviction petition should be allowed to proceed. This argument fails for\n       two reasons. First, petitioner\u2019s allegation that the possible effects of his medication\n       were unknown at the time of trial is directly contradicted by the documentation\n       petitioner submitted in support of his actual innocence claim and is also contrary to\n       the position he took when he raised an ineffective assistance claim in earlier filings.\n\n\u00b6 72       Second, even if we were to accept petitioner\u2019s assertion that it was not known\n       at the time of his trial that serotonin syndrome is a possible side effect of the\n       medications he was prescribed, this is not \u201cnew evidence\u201d of the sort necessary to\n       make a colorable claim of actual innocence because petitioner has presented no\n       evidence which establishes that he was actually suffering from serotonin syndrome\n       when he shot his girlfriend and her mother. To be sure, material referenced in\n       petitioner\u2019s postconviction petition does warn that the medications that were\n       prescribed for petitioner\u2014BuSpar and Desyrel\u2014when taken together, can cause\n       serotonin syndrome. However, the same material does not say that the medications\n       always cause serotonin syndrome. Indeed, the material states that the concomitant\n       use of these two medications should be closely monitored because they (like several\n       other combinations of medication often prescribed for depression) \u201ccan increase\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f       the risk of\u201d serotonin syndrome. Petitioner relies on the mere fact that he was\n       prescribed two medications 5 that could cause serotonin syndrome. He presents no\n       new evidence that would tend to show that he was, in fact, suffering from serotonin\n       syndrome.\n\n\u00b6 73       Accordingly, we find that the information provided by petitioner does not\n       constitute new evidence that persuasively demonstrates that petitioner was\n       suffering from serotonin syndrome at the time the offenses occurred and, as a result,\n       he lacked the substantial capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n       or conform his conduct to the law.\n\n\n\u00b6 74                                          CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 75       We conclude that petitioner has failed to present a colorable claim of actual\n       innocence because he presented no newly discovered evidence that persuasively\n       shows that, at the time he committed the offenses for which he was convicted, he\n       was involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medication and, therefore, was unable to conduct himself in accordance with the\n       law. Accordingly, it was not error for the trial court to deny petitioner leave to file\n       his second successive postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b6 76       Affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 77       JUSTICE CARTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n\n           5\n            It was noted in the background section that petitioner told Chief Bernabei that he filled the\n       prescription Dr. Brady gave him and took some of the medication, though he did not take the\n       medicine as prescribed because one of the medicines bothered his stomach. Thus, petitioner has not\n       even clearly established that he was taking these medications when he shot Wolf and Frasco.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f",

Taliani (petitioner) was convicted\n     of first degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 1992)) and aggravated battery\n     with a firearm (id. \u00a7 12-4.2(a)(1)) in relation to the July 12, 1994, shooting death\n\f     of his girlfriend, Francee Wolf, and the shooting and injury of Wolf\u2019s mother,\n     Clementina Frasco. A direct appeal, two postconviction petitions, and a motion for\n     relief from judgment were all unsuccessful.\n\n\u00b62       At issue now is petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive\n     postconviction petition, in which he asserts that he has set forth a colorable claim\n     of actual innocence based on \u201ca change in the law that allows for a new affirmative\n     defense [which] constitutes newly discovered evidence for purposes of an actual\n     innocence claim.\u201d The circuit court rejected this argument and denied petitioner\n     leave to file his second successive postconviction petition. That ruling was affirmed\n     on appeal. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 IL App (3d) 170546</span><pre class=\"inline\">. We granted petitioner leave to appeal to this\n     court (Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Oct. 1, 2019)) and now affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial\n     of petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b63                                           BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b64       On July 12, 1994, Clementina Frasco arrived home from work around 11 p.m.\n     and found that her 22-year-old daughter, Francee Wolf, was not there. Attempting\n     to locate her daughter, Frasco called one of Wolf\u2019s friends and learned that Wolf\n     was at petitioner\u2019s home. Frasco was aware that petitioner and Wolf had been\n     dating since the summer of 1993 but that Wolf wanted to end her relationship with\n     petitioner because he had become overly possessive and physically abusive. In late\n     December 1993, Cari Carlson, Wolf\u2019s cousin, witnessed petitioner slap, bite, choke,\n     and verbally insult Wolf before throwing Wolf to the ground. Wolf had also\n     confided to her friends that, on one occasion, petitioner admitted to Wolf that he\n     held a shotgun to her head as she slept and told her he had plans to kill her and then\n     commit suicide.\n\n\u00b65       Frasco called petitioner\u2019s home, but petitioner told Frasco that Wolf was not\n     there. Concerned for her daughter\u2019s well-being, Frasco drove to petitioner\u2019s home,\n     knocked on the door, and called out to her daughter. No one answered, but shortly\n     thereafter Frasco heard a loud noise1 come from inside the house. Wolf, dressed\n     only in a pair of silk shorts, then came running out of the house, crying and\n     screaming \u201cPsycho.\u201d Wolf was bleeding, and she told Frasco that petitioner hit her\n\n        1\n            The loud noise was later determined to be the discharge of a shotgun.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f       head. Wolf got into the front passenger side of Frasco\u2019s car, and Frasco attempted\n       to drive away.\n\n\u00b66         Petitioner then ran out of the house, dressed only in a pair of gray boxer shorts,\n       carrying a shotgun. He went to the driver\u2019s side of Frasco\u2019s car and fired a shot\n       through the driver\u2019s side window, attempting to hit Wolf but instead hitting the side\n       of Frasco\u2019s head. Petitioner then walked around to the passenger side, where Wolf\n       was bent over in the front seat with her head down. Petitioner fired a shot through\n       the passenger-side window, striking Wolf in the back, killing her.\n\n\u00b67         Officer Richard Taylor, who was patrolling in the area, heard the shots and\n       arrived on the scene as Frasco\u2019s car rolled into the street, jumped the curb, and came\n       to a stop. Frasco was screaming, \u201cHelp, we\u2019ve been shot.\u201d Officer Taylor radioed\n       for an ambulance as he went to the car to check on the occupants. When Taylor\n       checked on Frasco, she identified petitioner as the person who shot her and her\n       daughter.\n\n\u00b68         Officer Taylor then noticed a man, dressed only in boxer shorts, get into a black\n       car and drive off at a high rate of speed. Taylor radioed his partner, Officer Kevin\n       Sangston, who pursued the fleeing car and, ultimately, apprehended and arrested\n       petitioner.\n\n\u00b69        On August 9, 1994, petitioner was indicted on charges of first degree murder\n       and aggravated battery with a firearm. Appointed counsel moved to have petitioner\n       examined for fitness to stand trial and evaluated regarding his mental status at the\n       time of the shootings. The trial court granted the motion. However, before petitioner\n       was examined for fitness, he obtained new defense counsel, who withdrew the\n       motion and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. A psychiatrist, Dr.\n       Robert E. Chapman, was retained to examine petitioner and evaluate whether he\n       was sane at the time of the shootings.\n\n\u00b6 10       Later that year, petitioner was tried before a jury. At trial, the State presented\n       extensive testimony from numerous witnesses regarding petitioner\u2019s behavior in\n       the weeks and hours before the shootings. Several of Wolf\u2019s friends testified that,\n       during the three weeks prior to the shooting, petitioner had become increasingly\n       jealous about a perceived sexual relationship between Wolf and a man named\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f       Kevin Trovero. Witness testimony also provided a timeline of petitioner\u2019s activity\n       on Tuesday, July 12, 1994, the day of the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 11       Testimony revealed that petitioner began the day by going to work at the\n       jewelry store he owned. He had lunch with Marlo Capponi, whom he had been\n       dating since January 1994. 2 Petitioner and Capponi made plans to get together later\n       that evening. After lunch, petitioner went back to the jewelry shop, where he stayed\n       until he closed around 7 p.m. As petitioner was driving home, he saw a friend,\n       Michelle Castelli, driving her car. While the two cars were stopped at a traffic light,\n       they arranged to meet around 7:30 p.m. at a bar named Ellie\u2019s Tap. Castelli testified\n       that, at Ellie\u2019s, petitioner told her that he loved Wolf but that he was concerned she\n       might be seeing another man (Trovero). Castelli testified that she knew petitioner\n       well and, although he expressed concern about Wolf, he appeared to be his normal\n       self and did not appear to be under the influence of either drugs or alcohol.\n\n\u00b6 12       The bartender at Ellie\u2019s testified that he had known petitioner for eight years\n       and, on the night of the shootings, he saw petitioner come into the bar and have\n       three or four beers. He said petitioner \u201cacted normally\u201d and looked \u201ctotally sober\u201d\n       when he left the bar around 8:30 p.m.\n\n\u00b6 13       After leaving Ellie\u2019s bar, petitioner went to Verucchi\u2019s Bar and Restaurant.\n       Arthur Verucchi was working that night, and he testified that petitioner arrived\n       around 9:30 p.m. and stayed at the bar for 30 to 45 minutes. During that time,\n       petitioner had one vodka and water. Verucchi said petitioner did not act strangely\n       or appear disoriented or confused, nor did he seem to be under the influence of\n       alcohol or drugs. Two other bar patrons at Verucchi\u2019s that night confirmed Arthur\u2019s\n       testimony. After leaving Verucchi\u2019s, petitioner went home, intending to meet with\n       Capponi later on. But when he arrived home, Wolf was there.\n\n\u00b6 14      Kevin Trovero testified that, at about 11:15 p.m., petitioner phoned his home.\n       His wife answered the phone, and he got on another extension. Petitioner asked\n       Trovero\u2019s wife if she knew her husband was dating Wolf. Kevin then spoke up,\n\n           2\n             Capponi testified that she had \u201cheard rumors\u201d that petitioner was also dating Wolf. However,\n       she said petitioner denied it when she asked him about Wolf. After his arrest, Capponi regularly\n       visited petitioner in jail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -4-\n\f       denying petitioner\u2019s accusations. Both Kevin and his wife testified that, although\n       petitioner was accusatory and angry, he seemed in control of his faculties and was\n       not ranting or incoherent. After this phone call, petitioner and Wolf argued. Then\n       Frasco arrived at petitioner\u2019s home, and the shootings occurred as detailed above.\n\n\u00b6 15       At trial, Officer Sangston testified that, just after midnight, in the early morning\n       on July 13, 1994, he received instructions from Officer Taylor to apprehend the\n       driver of a black car with license plate A-U-S-T-N-T. Soon after receiving the radio\n       message, Sangston observed the vehicle and activated his lights. The car sped away,\n       and Sangston pursued with lights and siren on. The black vehicle continued without\n       stopping, passing several stop signs, then turned onto Route 6 and sped up, traveling\n       at approximately 75 miles per hour. When the vehicle traveled through an area\n       known as \u201cthe curves,\u201d which was under construction, the driver hit some\n       construction barrels, lost control, and crashed into the guardrail.\n\n\u00b6 16       Because Officer Sangston was told the driver could be armed, he drew his gun\n       and situated himself behind the door of his police car. The driver got out of his\n       vehicle and started walking slowly toward Sangston with his hands up. Petitioner\n       said, \u201cI\u2019m all out of shells.\u201d Sangston recognized the driver as petitioner from\n       previous encounters and ordered him to get down on the ground. Petitioner\n       disobeyed Sangston\u2019s command and, instead, continued to walk slowly toward\n       Sangston, saying \u201cShoot me, please shoot me.\u201d Sangston responded, \u201cSteve, just\n       get on the ground, we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d But petitioner continued to walk slowly\n       toward Sangston and said, \u201cThere is nothing to talk about. I have nothing left to\n       live for. Shoot me.\u201d Petitioner also threatened to take Sangston\u2019s gun away from\n       him and shoot himself.\n\n\u00b6 17       When petitioner got closer, Sangston holstered his gun and pepper sprayed\n       petitioner. Petitioner was then handcuffed and placed in Sangston\u2019s police car.\n       Once petitioner was secured, Sangston went to petitioner\u2019s vehicle and recovered a\n       double-barrel, sawed-off 20-gauge shotgun from the passenger-side floor.\n       Petitioner and the gun were transported to the police station.\n\n\u00b6 18       While being transported, petitioner said, \u201cOh my God, I can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d\n       and \u201cWhy the hell does she have to show up, we had everything worked out.\u201d At\n       the police station, petitioner continued to ask for someone to shoot him until\n       Sangston moved him to where he was to be interviewed. At that point, petitioner\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d Sangston replied that someone would be in to question\n       him. Petitioner then commented, \u201cHell of a way to get a DUI.\u201d Sangston testified\n       that, until then, there had been no mention of alcohol consumption or \u201cDUI\u201d by\n       anyone and that he saw no evidence that petitioner was under the influence of\n       \u201canything.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 19       Sangston stayed with petitioner while he waited to be interviewed. During this\n       time, petitioner apologized to Sangston for \u201cputting him through all this.\u201d Sangston\n       testified that, based on his observations of petitioner and their conversations, he\n       believed that petitioner was oriented as to time, place, and circumstance;\n       understood the criminality of his earlier conduct; and knew right from wrong.\n\n\u00b6 20       At the Spring Valley Police Department, in the early morning hours of July 13,\n       1994, petitioner was interviewed by Spring Valley police chief Doug Bernabei, who\n       was accompanied by Mike Miroux, an investigator for the Bureau County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department. Both Chief Bernabei and Miroux testified at trial, providing similar\n       accounts of the interview with petitioner, which took place from approximately 1\n       a.m. until 2:45 a.m. After petitioner was advised of his rights, he signed a waiver\n       and agreed to speak with them. Petitioner also signed a consent form, allowing the\n       police to enter his house to search it.\n\n\u00b6 21       Chief Bernabei testified that, during the interview, petitioner gave three\n       different statements. Initially, petitioner told Chief Bernabei and Miroux that he\n       remembered going to Verucchi\u2019s that night and leaving there at about 9:30 p.m. but\n       that he had no recollection of the rest of the evening until he was arrested by Officer\n       Sangston.\n\n\u00b6 22        Chief Bernabei testified that he asked petitioner to tell him everything he had\n       done since the previous Friday. In response, petitioner related the events of the\n       weekend and then continued on through Tuesday, the day of the shooting. This\n       time, petitioner said that, when he got home from Verucchi\u2019s, Wolf was at his\n       house. Petitioner remembered that Wolf got angry and they argued. He said Wolf\n       left his house and then stood outside screaming obscenities at him. Petitioner told\n       them he locked the door so Wolf could not get back inside but that then Wolf drove\n       away in her car and petitioner decided to go after her. Petitioner said he got in his\n       car and started driving around, trying to find Wolf. While searching for Wolf,\n       petitioner said he was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f\u00b6 23      Chief Bernabei testified that he then asked petitioner about the sawed-off\n       shotgun that was found in his car. Bernabei testified that, initially, petitioner denied\n       he had a gun in his car. Later, however, petitioner put his head in his hands, got\n       very \u201csomber,\u201d and said he would tell Bernabei \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24       In this third statement, petitioner told Chief Bernabei and Miroux that Wolf was\n       at his house when he got home from Verucchi\u2019s. Petitioner told them he and Wolf\n       had consensual sexual relations. Afterward, however, they got into an argument\n       because he was dating Marlo Capponi and he accused Wolf of dating Trovero.\n       Petitioner said that Wolf became angry because he called Trovero on the phone.\n       Petitioner then claimed that he thought Wolf was reaching for his shotgun, which\n       she knew he kept under his bed. Instead, petitioner got the gun, and when Wolf\n       taunted him, he fired two shots in the bedroom. Wolf then ran out of his house\n       screaming, \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 25       Petitioner told Chief Bernabei that, when Wolf ran out of the house, he got two\n       shells from his dresser drawer and reloaded his double-barrel shotgun. Then he ran\n       after Wolf. Petitioner told Chief Bernabei he saw Wolf in his yard, standing near a\n       tree, and that he shot at her to scare her so she would go back in the house where\n       he planned to kill her according to \u201chis plan.\u201d Although petitioner did not say\n       anything about Frasco, he admitted that he saw Wolf get into a car and that he fired\n       the shotgun at Wolf through the driver\u2019s side window because he wanted to kill\n       Wolf. Petitioner also admitted that he knew he was not arrested for driving under\n       the influence.\n\n\u00b6 26       Around 3 a.m., the officers who searched petitioner\u2019s house brought to the\n       station a typewritten letter they found in the kitchen of petitioner\u2019s home and a\n       typewritten note that had been attached to the door of petitioner\u2019s home. After\n       obtaining these documents, Chief Bernabei questioned petitioner a second time. He\n       showed the documents to petitioner, who explained that he had written out the note\n       and letter a few weeks earlier and then typed them, using the typewriter at the\n       jewelry store he owned. Chief Bernabei asked petitioner to sign and date the pages\n       of the letter as they reviewed it together.\n\n\u00b6 27      Petitioner explained to Chief Bernabei that he had been thinking about killing\n       Wolf for a long time and that he had a plan, which he claimed to have discussed\n       with Wolf. The plan was to kill Wolf at his home and then commit suicide so they\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       could be together forever. Petitioner also told Chief Bernabei that, a few weeks\n       earlier, he told his sister-in-law that he was depressed and thinking of committing\n       suicide. She told him to get help, and petitioner\u2019s brother came to petitioner\u2019s house\n       and took his shotgun away. Petitioner then made an appointment to see a\n       psychiatrist, Dr. Brady. Petitioner said he kept the appointment, which lasted about\n       two hours, but he did not feel any better after talking to the doctor. Petitioner also\n       admitted to Chief Bernabei that, even though he had decided to kill Wolf and\n       commit suicide prior to his appointment with Dr. Brady, he did not tell Dr. Brady\n       his plan. Instead, immediately after the appointment, he went to his store to type\n       the documents regarding his murder-suicide plan. Later on, he retrieved the shotgun\n       from his brother\u2019s house.\n\n\u00b6 28      Petitioner told Chief Bernabei that Dr. Brady prescribed two medications for\n       him\u2014one was to be taken three times a day, the other once at night. When Chief\n       Bernabei asked petitioner if he took the medicine, petitioner said that he did, but\n       not as directed. He said that he skipped doses of the one medication he was\n       supposed to take three times a day because it bothered his stomach.\n\n\u00b6 29      The typewritten note and letter written by petitioner were offered into evidence.\n       The note, which had been posted to the front door of petitioner\u2019s home, stated:\n\n           \u201cDO NOT COME IN ALONE!!!!!!!! WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND\n           INSIDE MAY NOT BE APPEALING. I AM VERY SORRY. ITS OK.\n           BEFORE YOU GO ANY FARTHER READ THE LETTER ON THE TABLE.\n           THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN SOME. ITS OK. I\u2019M NOT AFRAID\n           ANYMORE.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 30       The three-page letter addressed to \u201cChuck and Julie,\u201d which petitioner signed\n       and dated as he reviewed it with Chief Bernabei, had been found inside the home,\n       on the kitchen table. In this letter, petitioner left detailed instructions regarding the\n       distribution of his belongings and the handling of his business affairs. The\n       following statement was also in the letter: \u201cI can\u2019t have Francee do this to anyone\n       else especially me. Try to keep us together if you can.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 31       After the State rested, defense counsel called two psychiatrists to testify for the\n       defense: Dr. Richard Brady, who had been petitioner\u2019s treating psychiatrist, and Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       Robert Chapman, who had examined petitioner after the shootings and was called\n       as an expert witness regarding petitioner\u2019s sanity at the time of the shootings.\n\n\u00b6 32       Dr. Brady testified that he saw petitioner in his office on June 27, 1994,\n       approximately two weeks prior to the shootings. During the appointment, petitioner\n       reported that he was feeling depressed and had had suicidal thoughts \u201cthe weekend\n       before last.\u201d Dr. Brady said that petitioner assured him that he was not having any\n       suicidal or homicidal thoughts at that time and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d harm himself or\n       others. Dr. Brady further testified that he diagnosed petitioner with \u201crecurrent major\n       depressive disorder,\u201d general anxiety, and alcohol dependence. He prescribed two\n       medications for depression, BuSpar and Desyrel, and recommended that petitioner\n       obtain individual therapy. An appointment was made for July 11, but petitioner did\n       not show up for that appointment.\n\n\u00b6 33        Dr. Chapman, the psychiatrist retained by defense counsel, testified that he had\n       examined petitioner on September 1, 1994, approximately nine weeks after the\n       shootings. His diagnosis, after evaluating petitioner and reading \u201call of the official\n       reports,\u201d was that petitioner suffered from major affective disorder, obsessive-\n       compulsive disorder, and depression with suicidal ideation. Dr. Chapman reported\n       that petitioner had a high risk of suicide and apparently attempted to commit suicide\n       at least once while he was awaiting trial. 3\n\n\u00b6 34       Dr. Chapman also testified that, during the examination, petitioner appeared\n       anxious, \u201cquite confused, disorganized, and prone to intense feelings of panic.\u201d\n       Additionally, Dr. Chapman testified that petitioner reported feeling as if he was\n       \u201closing his mind\u201d and having \u201cbizarre and unusual sensory experiences and\n       confused thinking.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 35       Although Dr. Chapman was aware that petitioner had taken the medications\n       BuSpar and Desyrel, prescribed by Dr. Brady, he made no correlation between\n       petitioner\u2019s mental status at the time of the shootings and the medications he was\n       prescribed. Dr. Chapman testified that petitioner\u2019s depression had \u201csubstantially\n       impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his behavior.\u201d On cross-\n\n\n           3\n            One of the guards testified that the suicide attempt did not appear to be serious. Petitioner used\n       a broken piece of plastic to cut his wrist. There was very little blood, and petitioner did not need to\n       be hospitalized.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f       examination, Chapman emphasized, \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was unable [to appreciate the\n       criminality of his behavior], I said he was substantially impaired.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 36       After hearing all the evidence, the jury rejected the insanity defense and found\n       petitioner guilty of both first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm.\n       The trial court sentenced petitioner to an extended term of 70 years\u2019 incarceration\n       for first degree murder and a consecutive term of 30 years for aggravated battery\n       with a firearm, for a total sentence of 100 years.\n\n\u00b6 37       In his direct appeal, petitioner argued that his sentence was excessive and that\n       the trial court should have entered a directed verdict of not guilty by reason of\n       insanity because the evidence proved that he was legally insane at the time of the\n       shooting. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentence (People v.\n       Taliani, No. 3-94-0921 (1995) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court\n       Rule 23)), and this court denied his petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 38       In 1996, petitioner filed pro se a postconviction petition alleging that his trial\n       counsel and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance. Petitioner cited 17\n       separate errors by trial counsel, including counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to\n       suppress petitioner\u2019s confession. Petitioner also made six claims of ineffective\n       assistance of appellate counsel. The trial court dismissed this postconviction\n       petition at the first stage, and the appellate court affirmed. People v. Taliani, No. 3-\n       96-0672 (1997) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23). This\n       court denied the petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 39       In 2000, Taliani filed pro se a motion for relief from judgment, claiming in part\n       that he should receive a new trial because a State witness had testified in a civil suit\n       that petitioner\u2019s shooting of Frasco was accidental. Petitioner later amended the\n       motion to add an Apprendi claim (see Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\">530 U.S. 466</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n       (2000)). The trial court denied the motion, and the appellate court affirmed. People\n       v. Taliani, No. 3-00-0913 (2003) (unpublished order under Illinois Supreme Court\n       Rule 23). We denied leave to appeal.\n\n\u00b6 40       In 2002, while the appeal of his 2000 motion was still pending, petitioner filed\n       a second petition for relief from judgment, alleging that Dr. Brady, one of the\n       psychiatrists who had testified at his trial, had been convicted of practicing\n       medicine without a license. Petitioner later amended his motion with several\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       additional claims and accompanying documentation. This motion was treated as a\n       successive postconviction petition, and in 2003, the trial court appointed the public\n       defender to represent petitioner.\n\n\u00b6 41       Several months later, petitioner successfully moved to replace the public\n       defender with retained counsel. After a number of additional motions were ruled\n       on, defense counsel filed an amended successive postconviction petition in 2014.\n       In this amended petition it was alleged that defense counsel knew at the time of trial\n       that petitioner was taking BuSpar and Desyrel, medications that Dr. Brady had\n       prescribed, and that there was medical information at the time of trial that indicated\n       this combination of medications \u201ccan lead to a serious condition known as\n       \u2018serotonin syndrome\u2019 \u201d that can cause \u201cirritability, altered consciousness,\n       confusion, hallucination, coma,\u201d and \u201csuicidal thoughts.\u201d It was claimed in the\n       amended petition that trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by\n       withdrawing the petition for a fitness hearing and by failing to seek a second degree\n       murder instruction based on the prescribed medication he was taking. In support of\n       this ineffectiveness claim, petitioner attached to the petition various medical\n       articles about serotonin syndrome, which had been published prior to petitioner\u2019s\n       1994 trial and, therefore, would have been available to trial counsel.\n\n\u00b6 42       The trial court dismissed the successive petition, finding that petitioner failed\n       to show cause and prejudice and, therefore, the claims were barred by res judicata\n       because petitioner could have raised them in his first postconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 43       Petitioner appealed the dismissal, arguing that he had met the cause and\n       prejudice standard to file a successive petition on his ineffective assistance claims.\n       Petitioner also alleged that he did not need to show cause and prejudice regarding\n       his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to proffer a jury instruction\n       on second degree murder because this claim was an actual innocence claim.\n       Although petitioner admitted that he did not meet the general requirements for\n       proving an actual innocence claim, he argued that he did not need to do so because\n       he was only claiming to be \u201cactually innocent\u201d of \u201ca certain classification of\n       crimes,\u201d i.e., first degree murder. Petitioner explained his argument in this way\u2014\n       if a second degree murder instruction had been given to the jury, he would have\n       been found guilty of second degree murder and, therefore, he would have been\n       \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crime of first degree murder, for which he was convicted.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f\u00b6 44       The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the successive petition, finding\n       that the ineffectiveness claims could have been raised in his initial petition and\n       failed to meet the cause and prejudice test. The court also found that petitioner\u2019s\n       alleged \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim \u201cdefies logic and finds no support in Illinois law.\u201d\n       People v. Taliani, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2016 IL App (3d) 150478-U</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b6 45       In 2017, petitioner filed, pro se, a motion seeking leave to file a second\n       successive postconviction petition, which is the subject of the appeal now before\n       this court. Petitioner contended in the circuit court that he should be allowed to file\n       this successive petition because his claim is one of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d More\n       specifically, petitioner alleged that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which\n       he was convicted because, at the time he committed those offenses, he was\n       involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medications, BuSpar and Desyrel, which caused him to suffer from serotonin\n       syndrome. Petitioner attached some of the same literature on serotonin syndrome\n       that he had attached to his earlier postconviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 46       Petitioner acknowledged in the circuit court that an actual innocence claim must\n       be supported by \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d and that the evidence that he took\n       prescription medications that could cause serotonin syndrome was not \u201cnewly\n       discovered.\u201d He argued, nonetheless, that the affirmative defense of involuntary\n       intoxication based on unwarned side effects from prescription medication was not\n       recognized in Illinois until long after his trial, when People v. Hari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2014518\"><a href=\"/opinion/2014518/people-v-hari/\">218 Ill. 2d 275</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n       (2006), was decided. Petitioner claimed that this newly available affirmative\n       defense constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d for purposes of his actual\n       innocence claim. Petitioner further argued that it was more likely than not that, had\n       he been able to raise this affirmative defense at the time of his trial, the jury would\n       have found that he was involuntarily intoxicated and, as a result, he would have\n       been found not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted.\n\n\u00b6 47       The circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file his successive\n       postconviction petition and dismissed the petition, holding that petitioner failed to\n       present a colorable claim of actual innocence because he failed to establish with\n       any reasonable degree of certainty that no reasonable juror would have convicted\n       him had the jury considered the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication due\n       to unwarned side effects of prescribed medication.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 48       Petitioner appealed, and a majority of the appellate court affirmed the circuit\n       court. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 IL App (3d) 170546</span><pre class=\"inline\">. The majority, while questioning whether it was\n       even proper to permit a newly available affirmative defense to serve as the newly\n       discovered evidence element of an actual innocence claim, went on to hold that \u201cthe\n       allegations and supporting documentation did not show that these alleged side\n       effects rendered defendant intoxicated to the degree that he lacked substantial\n       capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\n       conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6 27</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       Justice McDade dissented and would have found that petitioner set forth a colorable\n       claim of actual innocence. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. \u00b6 36</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (McDade, J., dissenting).\n\n\u00b6 49      We granted petitioner leave to appeal to this court.\n\n\n\u00b6 50                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 51       The single issue before us is whether the trial court erred when it denied\n       petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to file a second successive postconviction petition.\n       Petitioner contends that leave should have been granted because he presented a\n       colorable claim of actual innocence.\n\n\u00b6 52       Where, as here, a petitioner raises an actual innocence claim in a successive\n       postconviction petition, the trial court should deny leave only where, as a matter of\n       law, no colorable claim of actual innocence has been presented.

He concedes that it was known at the time of\n       his trial that he was taking the prescribed medications, BuSpar and Desyrel, when\n       he committed the offenses for which he was convicted and, therefore, this is not\n       newly discovered evidence. However, petitioner argues that it was not known at the\n       time of his trial that these two medications, taken together, could cause serotonin\n       syndrome, a condition that may bring about mental status changes such as\n       heightened irritability, altered consciousness, and confusion. Petitioner claims this\n       information was only developed in the last several years. 4 However, he goes on to\n       argue that, even if this information had been available at the time of his trial, he\n       could not have raised the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication due to\n       unwarned side effects from prescription medication because that affirmative\n       defense was not recognized until this court\u2019s decision in Hari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2014518\"><a href=\"/opinion/2014518/people-v-hari/\">218 Ill. 2d 275</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus,\n       it is petitioner\u2019s position that, although it was known at the time of his trial that he\n       was taking BuSpar and Desyrel and that these medications could cause serotonin\n       syndrome, this evidence took on \u201cnew significance\u201d once the involuntary\n       intoxication affirmative defense was recognized. Therefore, according to petitioner,\n       once this new affirmative defense became available, the evidence that he was taking\n       Buspar and Desyrel and that he was not warned that taking these medications could\n       have caused him to suffer from serotonin syndrome, became the \u201cnewly discovered\n       evidence\u201d of his actual innocence. Petitioner further contends that, had he asserted\n       this defense at trial, it is more likely than not that the jury would have found that he\n       was involuntarily intoxicated and, therefore, not legally responsible for committing\n\n           4\n             As the State observes, this assertion is contrary to the position petitioner took earlier, when he\n       raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence in a prior successive\n       postconviction petition, alleging that information was available at the time of his trial that the\n       medications he was taking could cause serotonin syndrome. At that time, petitioner argued that the\n       information was evidence of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance for failure to seek a fitness hearing\n       and for failure to seek a second degree murder instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       - 16 -\n\f       first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm\u2014the crimes for which he\n       was convicted.\n\n\u00b6 61        In opposition, the State argues that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s\n       motion for leave to file a successive postconviction petition should be upheld\n       because petitioner has failed to present any newly discovered evidence of actual\n       innocence. The State argues that, even though the affirmative defense of\n       involuntary intoxication based on unwarned side effects of prescribed medication\n       was first recognized by this court in Hari, petitioner still could have argued at his\n       trial that the prescribed medication he was taking caused him to suffer mental status\n       changes that made him unable to understand the criminality of his actions. The State\n       points out that, in People v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">231 Ill. App. 3d 584</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), the trial court\n       permitted the defendant to present an involuntary intoxication defense based on the\n       defendant\u2019s use of a prescribed high dosage of valium. The Smith court noted that\n       several courts in other jurisdictions had held that an involuntary intoxication\n       defense could be based on unwarned side effects from prescribed medication. Thus,\n       the State argues that petitioner is incorrect when he claims that he could not have\n       raised an involuntary intoxication defense at his trial. In addition, the State contends\n       that the lack of precedent for asserting an involuntary intoxication defense should\n       not excuse petitioner\u2019s failure to do so.\n\n\u00b6 62       The State also asks that we reject petitioner\u2019s claim that the \u201cnewly recognized\u201d\n       affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication based on prescribed medication\n       transforms old evidence into the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence\n       necessary for asserting a colorable claim of actual innocence. However, the State\n       also argues that, even if we were to find that a newly available affirmative defense\n       can substitute for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence, petitioner\n       failed to show that this evidence, when considered along with all the evidence\n       presented at trial, would probably have led to a different result.\n\n\u00b6 63        First, we will acknowledge the irregularity of the claim that petitioner has\n       raised. Typically, an actual innocence claim is one in which a postconviction\n       petitioner presents newly discovered evidence persuasively showing that the\n       petitioner did not perform the acts that constitute the crimes for which he was\n       convicted. In other words, it is generally the case that a petitioner seeking leave to\n       file a successive postconviction petition alleging actual innocence brings before the\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f       trial court newly discovered evidence that challenges the physical elements of the\n       charged crimes, that is, the actus reus. For example, a petitioner might produce\n       DNA evidence, unavailable at the time of trial, in an attempt to persuasively show\n       that he was not the person who committed the acts or engaged in the conduct that\n       was attributed to him at trial. Or a petitioner might produce affidavits from new\n       witnesses who were unknown or unavailable at the time of trial and who identify\n       someone else as the perpetrator of the crime or can provide reliable evidence that\n       supports the petitioner\u2019s alibi defense.\n\n\u00b6 64        In situations such as these, our caselaw makes clear that the newly discovered\n       evidence, when viewed in the light of all the evidence produced at trial, must be of\n       such conclusive character that it would probably change the result on retrial. If these\n       elements are shown, the petitioner has produced a colorable claim of actual\n       innocence, which entitles him to bring his successive postconviction petition. The\n       trial court must grant the petitioner leave to file, and the matter will then go forward\n       for additional postconviction proceedings.\n\n\u00b6 65       The case before us does not present a typical actual innocence claim. Here,\n       petitioner does not produce any new evidence to show that he did not commit the\n       \u201cactus reus\u201d or physical elements of the offenses of which he was convicted. In\n       fact, petitioner does not now deny, nor has he ever denied, that he performed the\n       acts that resulted in his convictions for first degree murder and aggravated assault.\n       Instead, petitioner is claiming that newly discovered evidence, i.e., evidence that\n       he was involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medication, persuasively shows that he did not have the requisite mens rea when\n       he committed the crimes for which he was convicted. He further claims that, had\n       he presented this newly discovered \u201cevidence,\u201d it is more likely than not that the\n       jury would have found that he was involuntarily intoxicated and, as a result, he was\n       not legally responsible for the acts he committed because he did not have the\n       necessary mens rea.\n\n\u00b6 66       This is an unusual claim and appears to be one of first impression. Petitioner\n       has directed this court to no cases from any jurisdiction, nor has this court\u2019s research\n       into the matter revealed any such cases, that have held that a newly available\n       defense, which might negate the requisite mens rea element for the offenses\n       charged, may provide the basis for a colorable claim of actual innocence, capable\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f       of being brought under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. However, because the\n       State has not argued that a claim of actual innocence may not be based on evidence\n       that would negate the mens rea, for the purposes of this case we will assume that it\n       is theoretically possible for a petitioner to claim actual innocence by challenging\n       either the actus reus or the mens rea elements. Nevertheless, we find that, in this\n       case, petitioner\u2019s claim does not fit within the framework of a freestanding claim\n       of actual innocence.\n\n\u00b6 67       A freestanding actual innocence claim raised in a successive postconviction\n       petition is an extraordinary remedy. It is a collateral challenge of a conviction based\n       on principles of fundamental fairness and borne out of our constitutional obligation\n       to afford a person who presents new evidence that persuasively indicates that he or\n       she is factually innocent with the additional process necessary to prevent a\n       fundamental miscarriage of justice. Our express reason for allowing a freestanding\n       claim of actual innocence to be cognizable under our Post-Conviction Hearing Act\n       is our firm belief that allowing an innocent person to remain incarcerated would\n       offend all notions of fairness and due process. See Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2215616\"><a href=\"/opinion/2215616/people-v-washington/\">171 Ill. 2d at 488</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">-\n       89.\n\n\u00b6 68        Because a successive postconviction claim of actual innocence undermines the\n       finality of a conviction obtained after a fair trial, a postconviction petitioner seeking\n       to file a claim of actual innocence is held to a high standard. The petitioner must\n       produce newly discovered evidence that was unavailable at the time of trial and\n       could not have been discovered employing due diligence. Also, this new evidence\n       must be of such a conclusive character that it persuasively shows that the petitioner\n       is factually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted and that the evidence,\n       if presented at trial, would exonerate the petitioner.\n\n\u00b6 69       Based on our assumption that it is theoretically possible for petitioner to set\n       forth a colorable claim of actual innocence in a successive postconviction petition\n       asserting that he lacked the requisite mens rea, petitioner would have to produce\n       newly discovered evidence that, when considered along with all the evidence\n       presented at trial, would persuasively show that the petitioner lacked the substantial\n       capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct\n       to the law. Here, petitioner has not met this standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f\u00b6 70       A new defense is a new theory; it is not new evidence. Petitioner presents no\n       newly discovered evidence, whether in the form of witness affidavits or other\n       contemporary documentation, that would persuasively show that, at the time of the\n       shootings, he was involuntarily intoxicated and, therefore, lacked the substantial\n       capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct\n       to the law. The lack of new evidence of involuntary intoxication is particularly\n       striking when considered in the context of the evidence that was offered at trial,\n       including several witnesses who testified that petitioner\u2019s behavior just prior to the\n       shootings was unremarkable and that he was oriented as to time, place, and\n       circumstance. And, while it is true that Dr. Chapman testified at petitioner\u2019s trial\n       that petitioner lacked the substantial capacity to understand the criminality of his\n       conduct, that testimony was based on petitioner\u2019s diagnosed depression, not on\n       petitioner\u2019s claim of innocence based on involuntary intoxication. In addition, Dr.\n       Chapman\u2019s testimony is not new evidence, and his opinion that petitioner lacked\n       the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct was rejected by the jury.\n\n\u00b6 71       Petitioner alleges, however, that it was unknown at the time of trial that the\n       medications he was prescribed could cause \u201cserotonin syndrome\u201d and, therefore,\n       his postconviction petition should be allowed to proceed. This argument fails for\n       two reasons. First, petitioner\u2019s allegation that the possible effects of his medication\n       were unknown at the time of trial is directly contradicted by the documentation\n       petitioner submitted in support of his actual innocence claim and is also contrary to\n       the position he took when he raised an ineffective assistance claim in earlier filings.\n\n\u00b6 72       Second, even if we were to accept petitioner\u2019s assertion that it was not known\n       at the time of his trial that serotonin syndrome is a possible side effect of the\n       medications he was prescribed, this is not \u201cnew evidence\u201d of the sort necessary to\n       make a colorable claim of actual innocence because petitioner has presented no\n       evidence which establishes that he was actually suffering from serotonin syndrome\n       when he shot his girlfriend and her mother. To be sure, material referenced in\n       petitioner\u2019s postconviction petition does warn that the medications that were\n       prescribed for petitioner\u2014BuSpar and Desyrel\u2014when taken together, can cause\n       serotonin syndrome. However, the same material does not say that the medications\n       always cause serotonin syndrome. Indeed, the material states that the concomitant\n       use of these two medications should be closely monitored because they (like several\n       other combinations of medication often prescribed for depression) \u201ccan increase\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f       the risk of\u201d serotonin syndrome. Petitioner relies on the mere fact that he was\n       prescribed two medications 5 that could cause serotonin syndrome. He presents no\n       new evidence that would tend to show that he was, in fact, suffering from serotonin\n       syndrome.\n\n\u00b6 73       Accordingly, we find that the information provided by petitioner does not\n       constitute new evidence that persuasively demonstrates that petitioner was\n       suffering from serotonin syndrome at the time the offenses occurred and, as a result,\n       he lacked the substantial capacity to either appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n       or conform his conduct to the law.\n\n\n\u00b6 74                                          CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 75       We conclude that petitioner has failed to present a colorable claim of actual\n       innocence because he presented no newly discovered evidence that persuasively\n       shows that, at the time he committed the offenses for which he was convicted, he\n       was involuntarily intoxicated due to the unwarned side effects of prescription\n       medication and, therefore, was unable to conduct himself in accordance with the\n       law. Accordingly, it was not error for the trial court to deny petitioner leave to file\n       his second successive postconviction petition.\n\n\n\u00b6 76       Affirmed.\n\n\n\u00b6 77       JUSTICE CARTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n\n           5\n            It was noted in the background section that petitioner told Chief Bernabei that he filled the\n       prescription Dr. Brady gave him and took some of the medication, though he did not take the\n       medicine as prescribed because one of the medicines bothered his stomach. Thus, petitioner has not\n       even clearly established that he was taking these medications when he shot Wolf and Frasco.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f</pre>",

No. 0088672, Miami County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Safety\nBuilding, 201 West Main Street, Troy, Ohio 45373\n       Attorney for Appellee, CPS\n\n                                        .............\n\nEPLEY, J.\n\f                                                                                        -2-\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 1} Mother, the biological mother of R.R. and C.R., appeals from a judgment that\n\nawarded permanent custody of R.R. and C.R. to Miami County Child Protective Services\n\n(CPS). For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\n       I.     Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} R.R. and C.R. were born to Mother and Father (who is not a party to this\n\nappeal) in February 2011 and April 2012, respectively. At the time this case began, the\n\nchildren were in the care and custody of Mother; Father resided in a nursing home due to\n\nphysical and mental limitations.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} CPS became involved with R.R. and C.R. after Piqua police responded to\n\nMother\u2019s residence in January 2019 on a report that a child was locked in a detached\n\ngarage in the middle of the night screaming \u201cMommy, let me in, I\u2019m cold!\u201d When officers\n\narrived, they found C.R. locked in the detached garage (although during her testimony\n\nMother described the structure as a barn) with the temperature near zero.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} Mother admitted to police that C.R. had been locked in the garage as\n\npunishment for urinating in his pants. She also stated that her boyfriend had shot C.R.\n\nwith a BB gun. Upon examination of the boy, officers discovered a welt on his leg that\n\nlooked like a fresh BB mark. Piqua police reported that the conditions inside the home\n\nwere unsafe for children; roaches were crawling around, bedbugs were present, and trash\n\nwas everywhere.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Both Mother and her boyfriend were arrested. Mother was charged with child\n\nendangering and assault. Ultimately, she pled guilty to child endangering and was placed\n\non probation. The boyfriend spent time in jail for the assault on C.R.\n\f                                                                                       -3-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On February 25, 2019, CPS filed a complaint in the Miami County Common\n\nPleas Court, Juvenile Division, alleging that R.R. and C.R. were abused, neglected,\n\nand/or dependent children. Mother acknowledged her legal rights the next day, and on\n\nFebruary 28, 2019, the children were placed into the interim temporary custody of CPS.\n\nOn March 27, 2019, after an adjudicatory hearing, R.R. and C.R. were found to be\n\ndependent under R.C. 2151.04(C). A dispositional hearing was held on April 24, 2019,\n\nand a case plan was created to facilitate reunification of Mother with her children.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} The case plan had the following requirements: (1) ensure there is no drug\n\nuse in the home; (2) comply with mental health treatment; (3) comply with case\n\nmanagement services; (4) maintain clean, stable housing; (5) maintain taxable\n\nemployment; and (6) comply with drug screens.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Temporary custody was granted to CPS on May 5, 2019. From May until\n\nSeptember 2019, Mother had supervised parenting time with the children every other\n\nweek; those visits, however, ceased on September 26, 2019.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Mother was not making sufficient progress on the reunification plan, so on\n\nMarch 6, 2020, nearly a year after temporary custody was awarded to CPS and the case\n\nplan was put in place, a first extension of temporary custody of R.R. and C.R. was granted\n\nto CPS. Later that spring, a revised case plan was filed with the court. The objectives of\n\nthe plan remained the same, but two additional requirements were included: (1) R.R. and\n\nC.R. were not to be exposed to any violence or violent persons; and (2) Mother was to\n\nattend and participate in family therapy with Angie Gehret, the children\u2019s therapist, when\n\nrecommended.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} On July 24, 2020, CPS filed a motion to change the disposition from\n\f                                                                                          -4-\n\n\ntemporary custody of R.R. and C.R. to permanent custody. The memorandum in support\n\nasserted that granting CPS permanent custody of the children was in their best interest\n\nand that, in accordance with R.C. 2151.413(D)(1), R.R. and C.R. had been in the\n\ntemporary custody of CPS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nFurther, CPS alleged that the children could or should not be placed with either parent\n\nwithin a reasonable amount of time pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 11} A trial was held on the permanent custody motion on November 4, 2020.\n\nThe magistrate heard testimony from Mother, Father, psychologist Dr. Fred Sacks,\n\nKimberly Antonides \u2013 therapist at Recovery and Wellness in Tipp City, Angie Gehret, and\n\nJulie Tipton \u2013 CPS caseworker. On November 19, 2020, after considering the witness\n\ntestimony and volumes of exhibits, the magistrate granted permanent custody to CPS\n\nand terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on December 1, 2020,\n\nbut on April 23, 2021, the trial court overruled the objections and affirmed the magistrate\u2019s\n\ndecision to grant CPS permanent custody of R.R. and C.R. The court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the children had been in the temporary custody of CPS for 12\n\nor more months of a consecutive 22-month period and that permanent custody was in the\n\nbest interest of the children.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} Mother has filed a timely appeal.\n\n\n\n       II.    The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\n       {\u00b6 14} Mother raises two related assignments of error. In her first assignment of\n\nerror, she asserts that the trial court erred when it permanently removed R.R. and C.R.\n\f                                                                                          -5-\n\n\nfrom her care because there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that removal was\n\nin their best interest. Mother\u2019s second assignment of error argues that the evidence used\n\nto support the termination of her parental rights was \u201cincomplete, arbitrarily [sic], and the\n\ndecision as a whole was an abuse of discretion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 13. Because of the\n\nsimilar nature of the arguments, we will address them together.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The United States Supreme Court has described parents\u2019 interest in the\n\ncare, custody, and control of their children as \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental\n\nliberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct.\n\n2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). This interest, however, is not absolute. \u201cThe state has broad\n\nauthority to intervene to protect children from abuse and neglect.\u201d State ex rel. Allen Cty.\n\nChildren Servs. Bd. v. Mercer Cty. Common Pleas Court, Prob. Div., 150 Ohio St.3d 230,\n\n2016-Ohio-7382, 81 N.E.3d 380, \u00b6 58 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting).\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Because awarding permanent custody is a \u201cdrastic remedy that involves the\n\ntermination of parental rights, permanent custody determinations must be based upon\n\nclear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. \u201cClear and convincing\u201d means\n\nmore than a preponderance, but less than \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d In re Rose, 2017-\n\nOhio-694, 85 N.E.3d 498, \u00b6 19 (2d Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 17} R.C. 2151.414 sets forth a two-part analysis for courts to consider when\n\ndetermining a motion for permanent custody to a public services agency. First, the trial\n\ncourt must find by clear and convincing evidence that the child either (a) cannot or should\n\nnot be placed with the parent within a reasonable time; (b) is abandoned; (c) is orphaned\n\nwith no relatives above to take permanent custody; or (d) has been in the temporary\n\ncustody of a public or private children services agency for 12 or months of a consecutive\n\f                                                                                           -6-\n\n\n22-month period. In the Matter of I.W., 2d Dist. Clark No. 2019-CA-76, 2020-Ohio-1643,\n\n\u00b6 20; R.C. 2151.414. If the first prong is met, the court must then determine whether\n\ngranting permanent custody is in the best interest of the child. In the Matter of J.N. at\n\n\u00b6 26; R.C. 2151.414(B)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 18} To assist with this determination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) sets out factors the\n\ncourt must consider:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child's parents,\n\n       siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any\n\n       other person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the\n\n       child's guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child * * *;\n\n       (d) The child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent\n\n       custody to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply\n\n       in relation to the parents and child.\n\n\u201cNo one element is given greater weight or heightened significance.\u201d In re C.F., 113 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 73, 2007-Ohio-1104, 862 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 57.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Once a decision is made regarding permanent custody of a child, an\n\nappellate court will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion. In the Matter of J.N. at \u00b6 22.\n\nThe term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d implies the court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary,\n\nor unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140\n\f                                                                                          -7-\n\n\n(1983). \u201c[T]he discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded\n\nthe utmost respect, given the nature of the proceeding and the impact the court\u2019s\n\ndetermination will have on the lives of the parties concerned.\u201d Miller v. Miller, 37 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846 (1988). Because \u201c[t]he knowledge a trial court gains through\n\nobserving the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to\n\na reviewing court by a printed record[,] * * * the reviewing court in such proceedings should\n\nbe guided by the presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings were indeed correct.\u201d (Citations\n\nomitted.) Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Here, the trial court determined by clear and convincing evidence, in\n\nsatisfaction of R.C. 2151.44(B)(1)(d), that R.R. and C.R. had been in the temporary\n\ncustody of CPS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period. CPS was\n\ngranted temporary custody of the children on May 8, 2019 and they remained in the\n\nagency\u2019s custody even after the motion for permanent custody was filed on July 24, 2020\n\n\u2013 a span of approximately 14 months. Because of this determination, CPS did not have\n\nto demonstrate that R.R. and C.R. could not or should not be returned to Mother within a\n\nreasonable amount of time. R.C. 2151.44(B)(1)(a). Mother concedes that the children\n\nwere in the custody of CPS for the requisite amount of time. The court\u2019s analysis,\n\ntherefore, focused solely on whether a grant of permanent custody to CPS was in the\n\nbest interest of R.R. and C.R.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} When determining the best interest of the child, the court must consider all\n\nrelevant factors, including those found in R.C. 2151.414(D). The first factor to consider is\n\nthe interaction and interrelationship of the children with their parents, relatives, foster\n\nparents, and any other person who may significantly affect the child.\n\f                                                                                             -8-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 22} The record indicates that the relationship between Mother and R.R. and\n\nC.R. has been, and will continue to be, strained. As stated earlier, CPS became involved\n\nwith the children after Mother allowed C.R. to be locked in a freezing cold garage in the\n\nmiddle of the night because he wet his pants. She also permitted her boyfriend to shoot\n\nhim with a BB gun. In fact, the record reflects that Mother not only encouraged it, but\n\nlaughed. Both children also reported being locked in closets. This type of documented\n\nbehavior by Mother had led to feelings of distrust and anxiety from the children. Further,\n\nMother\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend amplified those feelings; both children reported\n\nintense fear of the boyfriend, and there were allegations in the record of physical and\n\nsexual abuse by the boyfriend.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} The fear and anxiety manifested in the children\u2019s reactions to having\n\nsupervised visitations with Mother. Angie Gehret, the children\u2019s therapist, testified that\n\nvisitations with Mother were difficult for R.R. and C.R. \u201c[The visits] were very emotional\n\nfor the kids,\u201d Gehret stated. \u201c[W]e would see a behavioral spike of negative behavior,\n\nespecially for R.R. after visitation[.] * * * [T]owards the end of July I was asked to talk to\n\nthe kids about how would they feel about visitation off-site and both kids had said although\n\nthey would like to see [Mother], they didn\u2019t want it off-site, they were worried that she\n\nwould hurt them and they only felt safe if * * * Children\u2019s Services were there to supervise.\n\n* * * [O]riginally they were happy to see [Mother], they absolutely didn\u2019t want any contact\n\nwith [the boyfriend]. * * * [A]s time went on, they both expressed more and more fear\n\nabout visitation and their mental health after visitations would deteriorate.\u201d Trial Tr. at 162.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} The anxiety about visits got so severe that on September 30, 2019, Gehret\n\nsent an unsolicited letter to CPS recommending that visitations with Mother be\n\f                                                                                            -9-\n\n\nimmediately suspended. R.R. was in such dire shape due to anxiety surrounding visits\n\nthat Gehret believed R.R. would need to be hospitalized. The visits were stopped, and for\n\na time, at least, the children improved.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} Gehret was not the only professional who recommended visitations stop.\n\nMother was referred by CPS to Dr. Fred Sacks, an independent psychologist. He testified\n\nthat he met with Mother for a total of 12 hours and ran several \u201cgold standard\u201d tests,\n\ndiagnosing her with major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline\n\npersonality disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom disorder. He stated at trial that\n\nthe test results demonstrated an overall response bias, which gave him concerns about\n\nher forthrightness and honesty. She was, according to the doctor, \u201cartfully avoidant\u201d\n\nregarding the issues surrounding the case and minimized her responsibility and\n\nwrongdoing. When she did discuss the incident with C.R., it was done with little emotional\n\nexpression and detachment. Dr. Sacks testified that Mother exhibited no insight into how\n\nthe situation could have affected her son and showed no empathy.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} In his report, Dr. Sacks noted that Mother \u201cappears to be in substantial\n\ndenial of her psychological limitations and, moreover, it appears that she is in some\n\nmassive denial of her limited capacity to be protective of her children\u2019s safety.\u201d He testified\n\nthat \u201cshe gave me no indications that she needed to reform.\u201d Dr. Sacks ultimately\n\nconcluded that Mother \u201cshould not be provided the opportunity to have continuing\n\nresponsibilities as a parent to her children.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Overall, the record shows the children\u2019s interactions and interrelationship\n\nwith Mother were problematic and strained.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} R.R. and C.R., though, had a positive relationship and interactions with their\n\f                                                                                         -10-\n\n\nfather, visiting him in the nursing home monthly, but his medical and residential situations\n\nmade it impossible to place the children with him. Gehret, though, testified that she had\n\nno problem with the children visiting their father in the future.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} According to the record, the strongest relationship the children had was with\n\ntheir foster mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} The next factor to consider was R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), the wishes of the\n\nchildren. In this case, the record is replete with evidence and testimony that both R.R.\n\nand C.R. did not wish to be placed with Mother, but rather ed to stay with their foster\n\nfamily. For instance, Gehret testified that R.R. would oftentimes say that she hated her\n\nmother and never wanted to see her. Gehret also noted that R.R. very much wanted to\n\nlive with her foster mother. Likewise, Gehret testified that C.R. had stated that he\n\nsometimes missed Mother but did not want to live with her. Instead, he wanted to live with\n\nhis foster mother forever. According to the CASA report, when asked where he wanted\n\nto live, C.R. responded, \u201cat my foster mother\u2019s home because it\u2019s my real home.\u201d The\n\nrecord is clear that the children did not wish to live with Mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(c) considers the custodial history of the children. Here,\n\nit was undisputed that both children were removed from Mother\u2019s custody on an interim\n\nbasis on February 28, 2019, and then CPS was granted custody on a temporary basis on\n\nMay 8, 2019. R.R. and C.R. had been in the temporary custody of CPS for 12 or more\n\nmonths of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The next factor, the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent\n\nplacement and whether that type of placement could be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency, weighed in favor of permanent CPS custody.\n\f                                                                                            -11-\n\n\nConcretely, the mental health professionals at trial testified that both Mother and Father\n\nwere unsuitable permanent placements for R.R. and C.R. In addition, Mother had failed\n\nto take any responsibility for the dangerous situation C.R. had been placed in, failed to\n\ncomplete the case plan required for reunification, and, evidently, had not completely\n\nbroken off the relationship with her boyfriend. Father, while having a loving, positive\n\nrelationship with the children, was unable to care for them due to physical and mental\n\nlimitations. In short, neither biological parent was suitable for permanent placement.\n\nThere was also testimony that CPS had contacted other relatives of the children to gauge\n\ntheir interest or ability to care for them long-term, but the relatives were either unwilling or\n\nunable to care for R.R. and C.R. on a permanent basis. Based on that, the trial court\n\nreasonably found that the only way to achieve the necessary permanency was through a\n\ngrant of permanent custody to CPS.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} The trial court did not find that any factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) through\n\n(11) were applicable.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} After considering the requisite factors, the trial court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that it was in the best interest of R.R. and C.R. to grant permanent\n\ncustody to CPS and to divest Mother of all parental rights. The court\u2019s 21-page decision\n\nwas detailed, analyzed all the needed factors, and was reasonable. Based on a thorough\n\nreview of the record and the discussion above, we cannot say the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       III.   Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 36} The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\f                                               -12-\n\n\n                               .............\n\n\n\nTUCKER, P.

For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\n       I.     Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} R.R. and C.R. were born to Mother and Father (who is not a party to this\n\nappeal) in February 2011 and April 2012, respectively. At the time this case began, the\n\nchildren were in the care and custody of Mother; Father resided in a nursing home due to\n\nphysical and mental limitations.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} CPS became involved with R.R. and C.R. after Piqua police responded to\n\nMother\u2019s residence in January 2019 on a report that a child was locked in a detached\n\ngarage in the middle of the night screaming \u201cMommy, let me in, I\u2019m cold!\u201d When officers\n\narrived, they found C.R. locked in the detached garage (although during her testimony\n\nMother described the structure as a barn) with the temperature near zero.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} Mother admitted to police that C.R. had been locked in the garage as\n\npunishment for urinating in his pants. She also stated that her boyfriend had shot C.R.\n\nwith a BB gun. Upon examination of the boy, officers discovered a welt on his leg that\n\nlooked like a fresh BB mark. Piqua police reported that the conditions inside the home\n\nwere unsafe for children; roaches were crawling around, bedbugs were present, and trash\n\nwas everywhere.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Both Mother and her boyfriend were arrested. Mother was charged with child\n\nendangering and assault. Ultimately, she pled guilty to child endangering and was placed\n\non probation. The boyfriend spent time in jail for the assault on C.R.\n\f                                                                                       -3-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On February 25, 2019, CPS filed a complaint in the Miami County Common\n\nPleas Court, Juvenile Division, alleging that R.R. and C.R. were abused, neglected,\n\nand/or dependent children. Mother acknowledged her legal rights the next day, and on\n\nFebruary 28, 2019, the children were placed into the interim temporary custody of CPS.\n\nOn March 27, 2019, after an adjudicatory hearing, R.R. and C.R. were found to be\n\ndependent under R.C. 2151.04(C). A dispositional hearing was held on April 24, 2019,\n\nand a case plan was created to facilitate reunification of Mother with her children.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} The case plan had the following requirements: (1) ensure there is no drug\n\nuse in the home; (2) comply with mental health treatment; (3) comply with case\n\nmanagement services; (4) maintain clean, stable housing; (5) maintain taxable\n\nemployment; and (6) comply with drug screens.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Temporary custody was granted to CPS on May 5, 2019. From May until\n\nSeptember 2019, Mother had supervised parenting time with the children every other\n\nweek; those visits, however, ceased on September 26, 2019.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Mother was not making sufficient progress on the reunification plan, so on\n\nMarch 6, 2020, nearly a year after temporary custody was awarded to CPS and the case\n\nplan was put in place, a first extension of temporary custody of R.R. and C.R. was granted\n\nto CPS. Later that spring, a revised case plan was filed with the court. The objectives of\n\nthe plan remained the same, but two additional requirements were included: (1) R.R. and\n\nC.R. were not to be exposed to any violence or violent persons; and (2) Mother was to\n\nattend and participate in family therapy with Angie Gehret, the children\u2019s therapist, when\n\nrecommended.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} On July 24, 2020, CPS filed a motion to change the disposition from\n\f                                                                                          -4-\n\n\ntemporary custody of R.R. and C.R. to permanent custody. The memorandum in support\n\nasserted that granting CPS permanent custody of the children was in their best interest\n\nand that, in accordance with R.C. 2151.413(D)(1), R.R. and C.R. had been in the\n\ntemporary custody of CPS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nFurther, CPS alleged that the children could or should not be placed with either parent\n\nwithin a reasonable amount of time pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 11} A trial was held on the permanent custody motion on November 4, 2020.\n\nThe magistrate heard testimony from Mother, Father, psychologist Dr. Fred Sacks,\n\nKimberly Antonides \u2013 therapist at Recovery and Wellness in Tipp City, Angie Gehret, and\n\nJulie Tipton \u2013 CPS caseworker. On November 19, 2020, after considering the witness\n\ntestimony and volumes of exhibits, the magistrate granted permanent custody to CPS\n\nand terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on December 1, 2020,\n\nbut on April 23, 2021, the trial court overruled the objections and affirmed the magistrate\u2019s\n\ndecision to grant CPS permanent custody of R.R. and C.R. The court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the children had been in the temporary custody of CPS for 12\n\nor more months of a consecutive 22-month period and that permanent custody was in the\n\nbest interest of the children.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} Mother has filed a timely appeal.\n\n\n\n       II.    The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\n       {\u00b6 14} Mother raises two related assignments of error. In her first assignment of\n\nerror, she asserts that the trial court erred when it permanently removed R.R. and C.R.\n\f                                                                                          -5-\n\n\nfrom her care because there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that removal was\n\nin their best interest. Mother\u2019s second assignment of error argues that the evidence used\n\nto support the termination of her parental rights was \u201cincomplete, arbitrarily [sic], and the\n\ndecision as a whole was an abuse of discretion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 13. Because of the\n\nsimilar nature of the arguments, we will address them together.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The United States Supreme Court has described parents\u2019 interest in the\n\ncare, custody, and control of their children as \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental\n\nliberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct.\n\n2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). This interest, however, is not absolute. \u201cThe state has broad\n\nauthority to intervene to protect children from abuse and neglect.\u201d State ex rel. Allen Cty.\n\nChildren Servs. Bd. v. Mercer Cty. Common Pleas Court, Prob. Div., 150 Ohio St.3d 230,\n\n2016-Ohio-7382, 81 N.E.3d 380, \u00b6 58 (O\u2019Connor, C.J., dissenting).\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Because awarding permanent custody is a \u201cdrastic remedy that involves the\n\ntermination of parental rights, permanent custody determinations must be based upon\n\nclear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. \u201cClear and convincing\u201d means\n\nmore than a preponderance, but less than \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d In re Rose, 2017-\n\nOhio-694, 85 N.E.3d 498, \u00b6 19 (2d Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 17} R.C. 2151.414 sets forth a two-part analysis for courts to consider when\n\ndetermining a motion for permanent custody to a public services agency. First, the trial\n\ncourt must find by clear and convincing evidence that the child either (a) cannot or should\n\nnot be placed with the parent within a reasonable time; (b) is abandoned; (c) is orphaned\n\nwith no relatives above to take permanent custody; or (d) has been in the temporary\n\ncustody of a public or private children services agency for 12 or months of a consecutive\n\f                                                                                           -6-\n\n\n22-month period. In the Matter of I.W., 2d Dist. Clark No. 2019-CA-76, 2020-Ohio-1643,\n\n\u00b6 20; R.C. 2151.414. If the first prong is met, the court must then determine whether\n\ngranting permanent custody is in the best interest of the child. In the Matter of J.N. at\n\n\u00b6 26; R.C. 2151.414(B)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 18} To assist with this determination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) sets out factors the\n\ncourt must consider:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child's parents,\n\n       siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any\n\n       other person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the\n\n       child's guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child * * *;\n\n       (d) The child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent\n\n       custody to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply\n\n       in relation to the parents and child.\n\n\u201cNo one element is given greater weight or heightened significance.\u201d In re C.F., 113 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 73, 2007-Ohio-1104, 862 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 57.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Once a decision is made regarding permanent custody of a child, an\n\nappellate court will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion. In the Matter of J.N. at \u00b6 22.\n\nThe term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d implies the court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary,\n\nor unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140\n\f                                                                                          -7-\n\n\n(1983). \u201c[T]he discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded\n\nthe utmost respect, given the nature of the proceeding and the impact the court\u2019s\n\ndetermination will have on the lives of the parties concerned.\u201d Miller v. Miller, 37 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846 (1988). Because \u201c[t]he knowledge a trial court gains through\n\nobserving the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to\n\na reviewing court by a printed record[,] * * * the reviewing court in such proceedings should\n\nbe guided by the presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings were indeed correct.\u201d (Citations\n\nomitted.) Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Here, the trial court determined by clear and convincing evidence, in\n\nsatisfaction of R.C. 2151.44(B)(1)(d), that R.R. and C.R. had been in the temporary\n\ncustody of CPS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period. CPS was\n\ngranted temporary custody of the children on May 8, 2019 and they remained in the\n\nagency\u2019s custody even after the motion for permanent custody was filed on July 24, 2020\n\n\u2013 a span of approximately 14 months. Because of this determination, CPS did not have\n\nto demonstrate that R.R. and C.R. could not or should not be returned to Mother within a\n\nreasonable amount of time. R.C. 2151.44(B)(1)(a). Mother concedes that the children\n\nwere in the custody of CPS for the requisite amount of time. The court\u2019s analysis,\n\ntherefore, focused solely on whether a grant of permanent custody to CPS was in the\n\nbest interest of R.R. and C.R.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} When determining the best interest of the child, the court must consider all\n\nrelevant factors, including those found in R.C. 2151.414(D). The first factor to consider is\n\nthe interaction and interrelationship of the children with their parents, relatives, foster\n\nparents, and any other person who may significantly affect the child.\n\f                                                                                             -8-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 22} The record indicates that the relationship between Mother and R.R. and\n\nC.R. has been, and will continue to be, strained. As stated earlier, CPS became involved\n\nwith the children after Mother allowed C.R. to be locked in a freezing cold garage in the\n\nmiddle of the night because he wet his pants. She also permitted her boyfriend to shoot\n\nhim with a BB gun. In fact, the record reflects that Mother not only encouraged it, but\n\nlaughed. Both children also reported being locked in closets. This type of documented\n\nbehavior by Mother had led to feelings of distrust and anxiety from the children. Further,\n\nMother\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend amplified those feelings; both children reported\n\nintense fear of the boyfriend, and there were allegations in the record of physical and\n\nsexual abuse by the boyfriend.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} The fear and anxiety manifested in the children\u2019s reactions to having\n\nsupervised visitations with Mother. Angie Gehret, the children\u2019s therapist, testified that\n\nvisitations with Mother were difficult for R.R. and C.R. \u201c[The visits] were very emotional\n\nfor the kids,\u201d Gehret stated. \u201c[W]e would see a behavioral spike of negative behavior,\n\nespecially for R.R. after visitation[.] * * * [T]owards the end of July I was asked to talk to\n\nthe kids about how would they feel about visitation off-site and both kids had said although\n\nthey would like to see [Mother], they didn\u2019t want it off-site, they were worried that she\n\nwould hurt them and they only felt safe if * * * Children\u2019s Services were there to supervise.\n\n* * * [O]riginally they were happy to see [Mother], they absolutely didn\u2019t want any contact\n\nwith [the boyfriend]. * * * [A]s time went on, they both expressed more and more fear\n\nabout visitation and their mental health after visitations would deteriorate.\u201d Trial Tr. at 162.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} The anxiety about visits got so severe that on September 30, 2019, Gehret\n\nsent an unsolicited letter to CPS recommending that visitations with Mother be\n\f                                                                                            -9-\n\n\nimmediately suspended. R.R. was in such dire shape due to anxiety surrounding visits\n\nthat Gehret believed R.R. would need to be hospitalized. The visits were stopped, and for\n\na time, at least, the children improved.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} Gehret was not the only professional who recommended visitations stop.\n\nMother was referred by CPS to Dr. Fred Sacks, an independent psychologist. He testified\n\nthat he met with Mother for a total of 12 hours and ran several \u201cgold standard\u201d tests,\n\ndiagnosing her with major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline\n\npersonality disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom disorder. He stated at trial that\n\nthe test results demonstrated an overall response bias, which gave him concerns about\n\nher forthrightness and honesty. She was, according to the doctor, \u201cartfully avoidant\u201d\n\nregarding the issues surrounding the case and minimized her responsibility and\n\nwrongdoing. When she did discuss the incident with C.R., it was done with little emotional\n\nexpression and detachment. Dr. Sacks testified that Mother exhibited no insight into how\n\nthe situation could have affected her son and showed no empathy.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} In his report, Dr. Sacks noted that Mother \u201cappears to be in substantial\n\ndenial of her psychological limitations and, moreover, it appears that she is in some\n\nmassive denial of her limited capacity to be protective of her children\u2019s safety.\u201d He testified\n\nthat \u201cshe gave me no indications that she needed to reform.\u201d Dr. Sacks ultimately\n\nconcluded that Mother \u201cshould not be provided the opportunity to have continuing\n\nresponsibilities as a parent to her children.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Overall, the record shows the children\u2019s interactions and interrelationship\n\nwith Mother were problematic and strained.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} R.R. and C.R., though, had a positive relationship and interactions with their\n\f                                                                                         -10-\n\n\nfather, visiting him in the nursing home monthly, but his medical and residential situations\n\nmade it impossible to place the children with him. Gehret, though, testified that she had\n\nno problem with the children visiting their father in the future.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} According to the record, the strongest relationship the children had was with\n\ntheir foster mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} The next factor to consider was R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), the wishes of the\n\nchildren. In this case, the record is replete with evidence and testimony that both R.R.\n\nand C.R. did not wish to be placed with Mother, but rather ed to stay with their foster\n\nfamily. For instance, Gehret testified that R.R. would oftentimes say that she hated her\n\nmother and never wanted to see her. Gehret also noted that R.R. very much wanted to\n\nlive with her foster mother. Likewise, Gehret testified that C.R. had stated that he\n\nsometimes missed Mother but did not want to live with her. Instead, he wanted to live with\n\nhis foster mother forever. According to the CASA report, when asked where he wanted\n\nto live, C.R. responded, \u201cat my foster mother\u2019s home because it\u2019s my real home.\u201d The\n\nrecord is clear that the children did not wish to live with Mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(c) considers the custodial history of the children. Here,\n\nit was undisputed that both children were removed from Mother\u2019s custody on an interim\n\nbasis on February 28, 2019, and then CPS was granted custody on a temporary basis on\n\nMay 8, 2019. R.R. and C.R. had been in the temporary custody of CPS for 12 or more\n\nmonths of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The next factor, the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent\n\nplacement and whether that type of placement could be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency, weighed in favor of permanent CPS custody.\n\f                                                                                            -11-\n\n\nConcretely, the mental health professionals at trial testified that both Mother and Father\n\nwere unsuitable permanent placements for R.R. and C.R. In addition, Mother had failed\n\nto take any responsibility for the dangerous situation C.R. had been placed in, failed to\n\ncomplete the case plan required for reunification, and, evidently, had not completely\n\nbroken off the relationship with her boyfriend. Father, while having a loving, positive\n\nrelationship with the children, was unable to care for them due to physical and mental\n\nlimitations. In short, neither biological parent was suitable for permanent placement.\n\nThere was also testimony that CPS had contacted other relatives of the children to gauge\n\ntheir interest or ability to care for them long-term, but the relatives were either unwilling or\n\nunable to care for R.R. and C.R. on a permanent basis. Based on that, the trial court\n\nreasonably found that the only way to achieve the necessary permanency was through a\n\ngrant of permanent custody to CPS.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} The trial court did not find that any factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) through\n\n(11) were applicable.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} After considering the requisite factors, the trial court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that it was in the best interest of R.R. and C.R. to grant permanent\n\ncustody to CPS and to divest Mother of all parental rights. The court\u2019s 21-page decision\n\nwas detailed, analyzed all the needed factors, and was reasonable. Based on a thorough\n\nreview of the record and the discussion above, we cannot say the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       III.   Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 36} The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\f                                               -12-\n\n\n                               .............\n\n\n\nTUCKER, P.

For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\n       I.     Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} R.R. and C.R. were born to Mother and Father (who is not a party to this\n\nappeal) in February 2011 and April 2012, respectively. At the time this case began, the\n\nchildren were in the care and custody of Mother; Father resided in a nursing home due to\n\nphysical and mental limitations.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} CPS became involved with R.R. and C.R. after Piqua police responded to\n\nMother\u2019s residence in January 2019 on a report that a child was locked in a detached\n\ngarage in the middle of the night screaming \u201cMommy, let me in, I\u2019m cold!\u201d When officers\n\narrived, they found C.R. locked in the detached garage (although during her testimony\n\nMother described the structure as a barn) with the temperature near zero.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} Mother admitted to police that C.R. had been locked in the garage as\n\npunishment for urinating in his pants. She also stated that her boyfriend had shot C.R.\n\nwith a BB gun. Upon examination of the boy, officers discovered a welt on his leg that\n\nlooked like a fresh BB mark. Piqua police reported that the conditions inside the home\n\nwere unsafe for children; roaches were crawling around, bedbugs were present, and trash\n\nwas everywhere.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Both Mother and her boyfriend were arrested. Mother was charged with child\n\nendangering and assault. Ultimately, she pled guilty to child endangering and was placed\n\non probation. The boyfriend spent time in jail for the assault on C.R.\n\f                                                                                       -3-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On February 25, 2019, CPS filed a complaint in the Miami County Common\n\nPleas Court, Juvenile Division, alleging that R.R. and C.R. were abused, neglected,\n\nand/or dependent children. Mother acknowledged her legal rights the next day, and on\n\nFebruary 28, 2019, the children were placed into the interim temporary custody of CPS.\n\nOn March 27, 2019, after an adjudicatory hearing, R.R. and C.R. were found to be\n\ndependent under R.C. 2151.04(C). A dispositional hearing was held on April 24, 2019,\n\nand a case plan was created to facilitate reunification of Mother with her children.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} The case plan had the following requirements: (1) ensure there is no drug\n\nuse in the home; (2) comply with mental health treatment; (3) comply with case\n\nmanagement services; (4) maintain clean, stable housing; (5) maintain taxable\n\nemployment; and (6) comply with drug screens.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Temporary custody was granted to CPS on May 5, 2019. From May until\n\nSeptember 2019, Mother had supervised parenting time with the children every other\n\nweek; those visits, however, ceased on September 26, 2019.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} Mother was not making sufficient progress on the reunification plan, so on\n\nMarch 6, 2020, nearly a year after temporary custody was awarded to CPS and the case\n\nplan was put in place, a first extension of temporary custody of R.R. and C.R. was granted\n\nto CPS. Later that spring, a revised case plan was filed with the court. The objectives of\n\nthe plan remained the same, but two additional requirements were included: (1) R.R. and\n\nC.R. were not to be exposed to any violence or violent persons; and (2) Mother was to\n\nattend and participate in family therapy with Angie Gehret, the children\u2019s therapist, when\n\nrecommended.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} On July 24, 2020, CPS filed a motion to change the disposition from\n\f                                                                                          -4-\n\n\ntemporary custody of R.R. and C.R. to permanent custody. The memorandum in support\n\nasserted that granting CPS permanent custody of the children was in their best interest\n\nand that, in accordance with R.C. 2151.413(D)(1), R.R. and C.R. had been in the\n\ntemporary custody of CPS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nFurther, CPS alleged that the children could or should not be placed with either parent\n\nwithin a reasonable amount of time pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 11} A trial was held on the permanent custody motion on November 4, 2020.\n\nThe magistrate heard testimony from Mother, Father, psychologist Dr. Fred Sacks,\n\nKimberly Antonides \u2013 therapist at Recovery and Wellness in Tipp City, Angie Gehret, and\n\nJulie Tipton \u2013 CPS caseworker. On November 19, 2020, after considering the witness\n\ntestimony and volumes of exhibits, the magistrate granted permanent custody to CPS\n\nand terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Mother filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on December 1, 2020,\n\nbut on April 23, 2021, the trial court overruled the objections and affirmed the magistrate\u2019s\n\ndecision to grant CPS permanent custody of R.R. and C.R. The court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the children had been in the temporary custody of CPS for 12\n\nor more months of a consecutive 22-month period and that permanent custody was in the\n\nbest interest of the children.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} Mother has filed a timely appeal.\n\n\n\n       II.    The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\n       {\u00b6 14} Mother raises two related assignments of error. In her first assignment of\n\nerror, she asserts that the trial court erred when it permanently removed R.R. and C.R.\n\f                                                                                          -5-\n\n\nfrom her care because there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that removal was\n\nin their best interest. Mother\u2019s second assignment of error argues that the evidence used\n\nto support the termination of her parental rights was \u201cincomplete, arbitrarily [sic], and the\n\ndecision as a whole was an abuse of discretion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 13. Because of the\n\nsimilar nature of the arguments, we will address them together.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The United States Supreme Court has described parents\u2019 interest in the\n\ncare, custody, and control of their children as \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental\n\nliberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v.

First, the trial\n\ncourt must find by clear and convincing evidence that the child either (a) cannot or should\n\nnot be placed with the parent within a reasonable time; (b) is abandoned; (c) is orphaned\n\nwith no relatives above to take permanent custody; or (d) has been in the temporary\n\ncustody of a public or private children services agency for 12 or months of a consecutive\n\f                                                                                           -6-\n\n\n22-month period.

Because \u201c[t]he knowledge a trial court gains through\n\nobserving the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to\n\na reviewing court by a printed record[,] * * * the reviewing court in such proceedings should\n\nbe guided by the presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings were indeed correct.\u201d (Citations\n\nomitted.) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Here, the trial court determined by clear and convincing evidence, in\n\nsatisfaction of R.C. 2151.44(B)(1)(d), that R.R. and C.R. had been in the temporary\n\ncustody of CPS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period. CPS was\n\ngranted temporary custody of the children on May 8, 2019 and they remained in the\n\nagency\u2019s custody even after the motion for permanent custody was filed on July 24, 2020\n\n\u2013 a span of approximately 14 months. Because of this determination, CPS did not have\n\nto demonstrate that R.R. and C.R. could not or should not be returned to Mother within a\n\nreasonable amount of time. R.C. 2151.44(B)(1)(a). Mother concedes that the children\n\nwere in the custody of CPS for the requisite amount of time. The court\u2019s analysis,\n\ntherefore, focused solely on whether a grant of permanent custody to CPS was in the\n\nbest interest of R.R. and C.R.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} When determining the best interest of the child, the court must consider all\n\nrelevant factors, including those found in R.C. 2151.414(D). The first factor to consider is\n\nthe interaction and interrelationship of the children with their parents, relatives, foster\n\nparents, and any other person who may significantly affect the child.\n\f                                                                                             -8-\n\n\n       {\u00b6 22} The record indicates that the relationship between Mother and R.R. and\n\nC.R. has been, and will continue to be, strained. As stated earlier, CPS became involved\n\nwith the children after Mother allowed C.R. to be locked in a freezing cold garage in the\n\nmiddle of the night because he wet his pants. She also permitted her boyfriend to shoot\n\nhim with a BB gun. In fact, the record reflects that Mother not only encouraged it, but\n\nlaughed. Both children also reported being locked in closets. This type of documented\n\nbehavior by Mother had led to feelings of distrust and anxiety from the children. Further,\n\nMother\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend amplified those feelings; both children reported\n\nintense fear of the boyfriend, and there were allegations in the record of physical and\n\nsexual abuse by the boyfriend.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} The fear and anxiety manifested in the children\u2019s reactions to having\n\nsupervised visitations with Mother. Angie Gehret, the children\u2019s therapist, testified that\n\nvisitations with Mother were difficult for R.R. and C.R. \u201c[The visits] were very emotional\n\nfor the kids,\u201d Gehret stated. \u201c[W]e would see a behavioral spike of negative behavior,\n\nespecially for R.R. after visitation[.] * * * [T]owards the end of July I was asked to talk to\n\nthe kids about how would they feel about visitation off-site and both kids had said although\n\nthey would like to see [Mother], they didn\u2019t want it off-site, they were worried that she\n\nwould hurt them and they only felt safe if * * * Children\u2019s Services were there to supervise.\n\n* * * [O]riginally they were happy to see [Mother], they absolutely didn\u2019t want any contact\n\nwith [the boyfriend]. * * * [A]s time went on, they both expressed more and more fear\n\nabout visitation and their mental health after visitations would deteriorate.\u201d Trial Tr. at 162.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} The anxiety about visits got so severe that on September 30, 2019, Gehret\n\nsent an unsolicited letter to CPS recommending that visitations with Mother be\n\f                                                                                            -9-\n\n\nimmediately suspended. R.R. was in such dire shape due to anxiety surrounding visits\n\nthat Gehret believed R.R. would need to be hospitalized. The visits were stopped, and for\n\na time, at least, the children improved.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} Gehret was not the only professional who recommended visitations stop.\n\nMother was referred by CPS to Dr. Fred Sacks, an independent psychologist. He testified\n\nthat he met with Mother for a total of 12 hours and ran several \u201cgold standard\u201d tests,\n\ndiagnosing her with major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline\n\npersonality disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom disorder. He stated at trial that\n\nthe test results demonstrated an overall response bias, which gave him concerns about\n\nher forthrightness and honesty. She was, according to the doctor, \u201cartfully avoidant\u201d\n\nregarding the issues surrounding the case and minimized her responsibility and\n\nwrongdoing. When she did discuss the incident with C.R., it was done with little emotional\n\nexpression and detachment. Dr. Sacks testified that Mother exhibited no insight into how\n\nthe situation could have affected her son and showed no empathy.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} In his report, Dr. Sacks noted that Mother \u201cappears to be in substantial\n\ndenial of her psychological limitations and, moreover, it appears that she is in some\n\nmassive denial of her limited capacity to be protective of her children\u2019s safety.\u201d He testified\n\nthat \u201cshe gave me no indications that she needed to reform.\u201d Dr. Sacks ultimately\n\nconcluded that Mother \u201cshould not be provided the opportunity to have continuing\n\nresponsibilities as a parent to her children.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Overall, the record shows the children\u2019s interactions and interrelationship\n\nwith Mother were problematic and strained.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} R.R. and C.R., though, had a positive relationship and interactions with their\n\f                                                                                         -10-\n\n\nfather, visiting him in the nursing home monthly, but his medical and residential situations\n\nmade it impossible to place the children with him. Gehret, though, testified that she had\n\nno problem with the children visiting their father in the future.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} According to the record, the strongest relationship the children had was with\n\ntheir foster mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} The next factor to consider was R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), the wishes of the\n\nchildren. In this case, the record is replete with evidence and testimony that both R.R.\n\nand C.R. did not wish to be placed with Mother, but rather ed to stay with their foster\n\nfamily. For instance, Gehret testified that R.R. would oftentimes say that she hated her\n\nmother and never wanted to see her. Gehret also noted that R.R. very much wanted to\n\nlive with her foster mother. Likewise, Gehret testified that C.R. had stated that he\n\nsometimes missed Mother but did not want to live with her. Instead, he wanted to live with\n\nhis foster mother forever. According to the CASA report, when asked where he wanted\n\nto live, C.R. responded, \u201cat my foster mother\u2019s home because it\u2019s my real home.\u201d The\n\nrecord is clear that the children did not wish to live with Mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(c) considers the custodial history of the children. Here,\n\nit was undisputed that both children were removed from Mother\u2019s custody on an interim\n\nbasis on February 28, 2019, and then CPS was granted custody on a temporary basis on\n\nMay 8, 2019. R.R. and C.R. had been in the temporary custody of CPS for 12 or more\n\nmonths of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The next factor, the children\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent\n\nplacement and whether that type of placement could be achieved without a grant of\n\npermanent custody to the agency, weighed in favor of permanent CPS custody.\n\f                                                                                            -11-\n\n\nConcretely, the mental health professionals at trial testified that both Mother and Father\n\nwere unsuitable permanent placements for R.R. and C.R. In addition, Mother had failed\n\nto take any responsibility for the dangerous situation C.R. had been placed in, failed to\n\ncomplete the case plan required for reunification, and, evidently, had not completely\n\nbroken off the relationship with her boyfriend. Father, while having a loving, positive\n\nrelationship with the children, was unable to care for them due to physical and mental\n\nlimitations. In short, neither biological parent was suitable for permanent placement.\n\nThere was also testimony that CPS had contacted other relatives of the children to gauge\n\ntheir interest or ability to care for them long-term, but the relatives were either unwilling or\n\nunable to care for R.R. and C.R. on a permanent basis. Based on that, the trial court\n\nreasonably found that the only way to achieve the necessary permanency was through a\n\ngrant of permanent custody to CPS.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} The trial court did not find that any factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) through\n\n(11) were applicable.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} After considering the requisite factors, the trial court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that it was in the best interest of R.R. and C.R. to grant permanent\n\ncustody to CPS and to divest Mother of all parental rights. The court\u2019s 21-page decision\n\nwas detailed, analyzed all the needed factors, and was reasonable. Based on a thorough\n\nreview of the record and the discussion above, we cannot say the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       III.   Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 36} The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\f                                               -12-\n\n\n                               .............\n\n\n\nTUCKER, P.

Nanners, appeals the Circuit Court of\nWebster County\u2019s March 16, 2021, order terminating his parental rights to A.B.-1, P.B., J.B., and\nA.B.-2. 1 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d), by counsel\nPatrick Morrisey and Mindy M. Parsley, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\nThe guardian ad litem (\u201cguardian\u201d), Mary Elizabeth Snead, filed a response on behalf of the\nchildren also in support of the circuit court\u2019s order. On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt erred in denying him a post-adjudicatory improvement period and terminating his parental\nrights.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        Petitioner and the children\u2019s mother have a significant history of Child Protective Services\n(\u201cCPS\u201d) intervention. The DHHR filed a petition against the parents in 2013 due to their substance\nabuse, poor home conditions, and medical neglect of the children. The circuit court adjudicated\nthe parents as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement\nperiod, which they successfully completed. As such, the children were returned to their custody.\nSubsequently, in 2018, the DHHR filed another petition against the parents due to substance abuse,\npoor home conditions, and domestic violence. The circuit court again adjudicated them as abusing\n\n       1\n         Consistent with our long-standing practice in cases with sensitive facts, we use initials\nwhere necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case. See In re K.H., 235 W. Va.\n254, 773 S.E.2d 20 (2015); Melinda H. v. William R. II, 230 W. Va. 731, 742 S.E.2d 419 (2013);\nState v. Brandon B., 218 W. Va. 324, 624 S.E.2d 761 (2005); State v. Edward Charles L., 183 W.\nVa. 641, 398 S.E.2d 123 (1990). Because two of the children and petitioner share the same initials,\nwe will refer to them as A.B.-1, A.B.-2, and A.B.-3 respectively, throughout the memorandum\ndecision.\n                                                  1\n\fand neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement period. The parents also\ncompleted these improvement periods, and the children were returned to their custody in May of\n2019.\n\n        Only a few months later, in January of 2020, the DHHR filed the instant abuse and neglect\npetition against the parents. According to the DHHR, then fourteen-year-old J.B. disclosed to her\nschool principal that her mother choked her and hit her with a telephone. The child further\ndisclosed that the parents were abusing drugs, that she had seen a white powdery substance and a\nstraw on a countertop in the home, and that the home smelled of marijuana. J.B. further indicated\nthat she did not feel safe in the home. Following J.B.\u2019s disclosure, a CPS worker responded to the\nparents\u2019 home and informed them of the referral concerning possible drug use. The parents were\nagitated during the exchange and frequently went in and out of petitioner\u2019s parents\u2019 home, which\nwas next door, and refused to allow the CPS worker or law enforcement into their own home.\nEventually, the parents agreed to submit to a drug screen at the local hospital, which was positive\nfor oxycontin. Thereafter, the CPS worker petitioned for and received a ratification for emergency\ncustody of the children, who were placed with the paternal grandparents with instructions that no\ncontact between the children and the parents was to occur.\n\n        A few days later, J.B. informed a CPS worker that on the day her parents submitted to a\ndrug screen, they called the paternal grandparents\u2019 home to request that J.B. urinate in a cup and\nbring it to them so they would not \u201cgo to jail.\u201d J.B. indicated that the parents had previously asked\nher to urinate in a cup for them. She also disclosed that petitioner had been to the paternal\ngrandparents\u2019 home every day since the children had been removed from the parents\u2019 care and told\nthe children not to talk to CPS. Lastly, J.B. indicated that she chose to disclose the allegations\nagainst her parents because they had become increasingly aggressive with each other and had\nstruck the child P.B.\n\n        Based on this information, the DHHR alleged that the parents abused drugs, which\nnegatively affected their ability to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the children, and\nthat they failed to provide a fit and suitable home. An amended petition was filed shortly thereafter\nindicating that petitioner tested positive for methamphetamine following a hair follicle test.\n\n        The circuit court held an adjudicatory hearing in May of 2020. A CPS worker testified\nregarding the allegations in the petition, including J.B.\u2019s disclosures and the worker\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation into the matter. The CPS worker testified that J.B. reported drug abuse in the home\nand further testified that the parents tested positive for oxycontin on the day of the removal. A CPS\nsupervisor also testified regarding J.B.\u2019s disclosures stating that the child said that on the day the\nchildren were removed from the home, petitioner asked J.B. to urinate in a cup for him so that he\ncould use her urine to pass his drug test, and that he had asked J.B. do so on prior occasions.\nPetitioner\u2019s therapist testified that petitioner denied the allegations made by J.B. but admitted that\nhe later tested positive for methamphetamine through a hair follicle test.\n\n      Petitioner testified that J.B. fabricated the allegations against him and the mother because\nthey would not allow her to date an older boy. Petitioner admitted testing positive for\nmethamphetamine through the hair follicle test and explained that he \u201cslipped up one evening in\nNovember\u201d of 2019. Petitioner denied abusing oxycontin as alleged in the petition, noting that the\n\n                                                  2\n\fscreen was not sent for laboratory confirmation and that the hair follicle test had not shown traces\nof oxycontin. Petitioner denied further drug abuse and domestic violence in the home.\n\n       Following testimony, the circuit court noted that it had watched J.B.\u2019s Child Advocacy\nCenter interview and observed that the child was very hostile and angry; the court indicated that it\nconsidered her behavior in weighing the credibility of her statements. The circuit court also noted\ninconsistencies in the parents\u2019 testimony and ultimately determined that J.B.\u2019s disclosures were\ncredible. The circuit court found that the parents accused J.B. of making up the allegations against\nthem because they allegedly angered her by telling her that her boyfriend was too old for her, but\nthere was no evidence to support such an allegation. The circuit court further found that the parents\nengaged in domestic violence in the children\u2019s presence, abused drugs, and failed to maintain a fit\nand suitable home. Accordingly, the circuit court adjudicated petitioner as an abusing parent.\n\n       Subsequently, in October of 2020, the mother gave birth to A.B.-2, and the DHHR filed an\namended petition adding the child to the proceedings. 2 A.B.-2 was removed from petitioner\u2019s\ncustody at that time. The circuit court adjudicated the parents as abusing parents with regard to\nA.B.-2 in November of 2020.\n\n        The circuit court held a dispositional hearing in January of 2021. The DHHR presented the\ntestimony of the parents\u2019 counselor, who testified that she had previously provided counseling to\npetitioner during a prior case and had done so throughout the instant case, addressing issues such\nas substance abuse, parenting, anxiety, and depression. The counselor opined that petitioner made\nsome progress throughout the proceedings, was cooperating during the sessions, and was\nmotivated to change his behavior. However, the counselor acknowledged that the parents had been\ncontacting J.B. in violation of the court\u2019s order and that the mother was urging the child to \u201ctell\nthe truth\u201d by retracting her statements of abuse. Moreover, the counselor admitted that she did \u201cnot\ndisagree\u201d with a psychologist\u2019s determination that petitioner had an extremely poor prognosis of\nattaining minimally adequate parenting skills.\n\n        Next, J.B.\u2019s foster mother testified regarding contact between the child and the parents.\nThe foster mother explained that the parents were prohibited from contacting J.B., but that the\nchild admitted that she and the parents remained in contact via Facebook Messenger. J.B. disclosed\nthat before contact with her parents was prohibited, she attended a supervised visit wherein\npetitioner managed to slip a cellphone into her bag unnoticed by the service provider. The foster\nmother testified that she searched the child\u2019s bag, found the cellphone, and read messages sent to\nJ.B. by the parents. The foster mother stated that the parents were encouraging J.B. to change her\nstory and tell the DHHR that she fabricated the allegations against the parents.\n\n        The DHHR also called the evaluating psychologist to testify regarding her evaluations of\npetitioner, J.B., and A.B.-1. Regarding J.B., the psychologist testified that she diagnosed her with\nmajor depressive disorder due to her reported history of suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well as\nproblems related to sleep, worry, and self-esteem. When asked what the cause of these problems\ncould be, the psychologist stated that \u201cwhen a child, you know, of her age is having those types of\nsevere behaviors, including the cutting and the suicidal ideation, and those types of things, there\u2019s\n\n\n       2\n           Petitioner is the father of A.B.-2.\n                                                 3\n\falways a concern for the environment that she was in.\u201d The psychologist further opined that it\nwould be better \u201cin the long run\u201d for J.B. to not return to the parents\u2019 care based upon the number\nof removals and the fact that the parents failed to rectify the issues leading to the children\u2019s removal\nover multiple cases and with services. Likewise, the psychologist opined that it would not be in\nA.B.-1\u2019s best interest to be returned to the parents\u2019 care. The psychologist noted that A.B.-1 was\ndiagnosed with autism and cerebral palsy and required significant care. Further, A.B.-1 needed a\nstable, consistent home environment that would provide him with the services he needed. The\nevaluator also opined that petitioner blamed others instead of accepting responsibility for his\nactions, which indicated that he had little motivation to make long-term changes. The evaluator\nconcluded that \u201c[g]iven [petitioner\u2019s] lack of accountability, failure to correct the abuse and\nneglect present in the previous cases, failure to benefit from services, as well as long-term\nsubstance dependence, and lack of significant periods of sobriety, . . . [petitioner\u2019s] prognosis for\nimproved parenting . . . is extremely poor.\u201d The evaluator also stated that she was not aware of\nany additional services that could be provided to petitioner to correct the circumstances of abuse.\n\n       The DHHR\u2019s next witness, a service provider, testified that she provided the parents with\nparenting classes in both the 2018 case and the instant case. The service provider stated that the\nparents were cooperative and appeared to understand the concepts of the material taught but\ncontinued to deny the allegations against them, instead blaming J.B. for the situation. The service\nprovided further stated that petitioner denied giving J.B. a cellphone during a supervised visit. A\nCPS worker corroborated the service provider\u2019s testimony that petitioner was compliant with\nservices.\n\n        Petitioner presented the testimony of another service provider who supervised his visits\nwith the children. The provider testified that petitioner did well with the visits, appeared bonded\nwith the children, provided food and activities, and was loving towards the children. Petitioner\nrequested a post-adjudicatory improvement period. He testified that he complied with services,\nremained drug-free throughout the proceedings, and was deeply bonded with his children.\nPetitioner denied providing J.B. with a cellphone and communicating with her, stating that his wife\nwas the one who communicated with the child, unbeknownst to him. When asked what the issues\nof abuse and neglect were, petitioner stated that he could be \u201ccleanlier\u201d and that his drug use\n\u201cshould never have happened,\u201d but denied any domestic violence in the home.\n\n        Following respective counsel\u2019s arguments, the circuit court found that the children had\nbeen removed from the parents\u2019 care three times, but that petitioner failed to accept responsibility\nfor his actions and consistently blamed J.B. for the proceedings. Further, the issues in the instant\ncase included drug use and poor home conditions, which were identical to the issues in the prior\ntwo cases. While the parents accused J.B. of lying throughout the case, the circuit court found that\nsuch accusations were contrary to the evidence and further found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was\n\u201cless than credible.\u201d Ultimately, the circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s request for an improvement\nperiod and terminated his parental rights upon finding that there was no reasonable likelihood that\npetitioner could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near future and that termination\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fwas necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. Petitioner appeals the circuit court\u2019s March 16, 2021,\ndispositional order. 3\n\n       The Court has previously established the following standard of review in cases such as this:\n\n               \u201cAlthough conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to de\n       novo review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the\n       facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the\n       evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such\n       child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing\n       court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there\n       is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\n       with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However,\n       a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided\n       the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court\u2019s account of the\n       evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, In\n       Interest of Tiffany Marie S., 196 W.Va. 223, 470 S.E.2d 177 (1996).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, In re Cecil T., 228 W. Va. 89, 717 S.E.2d 873 (2011).\n\n        On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for an\nimprovement period and in terminating his parental rights. According to petitioner, he was fully\ncompliant with the services offered by the DHHR, remained drug-free throughout the proceedings,\nscheduled his own counseling and appointments, and appeared at all hearings and multidisciplinary\nteam meetings. Petitioner also argues that testimony established that he was cooperative and\ncompliant with services, had a bond with the children, and completed everything requested of him\nby the DHHR and the court. Based on the foregoing, petitioner contends that he met his burden of\nestablishing he was likely to participate in an improvement period, and further contends that there\nwas a reasonable likelihood that he could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near\nfuture.\n\n        The decision to grant or deny an improvement period rests in the sound discretion of the\ncircuit court. See In re M.M., 236 W. Va. 108, 115, 778 S.E.2d 338, 345 (2015) (\u201cWest Virginia\nlaw allows the circuit court discretion in deciding whether to grant a parent an improvement\nperiod.\u201d); Syl. Pt. 6, in part, In re Katie S., 198 W. Va. 79, 479 S.E.2d 589 (1996) (\u201cIt is within the\ncourt\u2019s discretion to grant an improvement period within the applicable statutory requirements[.]\u201d).\nWe have also held that a parent\u2019s \u201centitlement to an improvement period is conditioned upon the\nability of the [parent] to demonstrate \u2018by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is\nlikely to fully participate in the improvement period.\u2019\u201d In re Charity H., 215 W. Va. 208, 215, 599\nS.E.2d 631, 638 (2004). However, the circuit court has discretion to deny an improvement period\nwhen no improvement is likely. See In re Tonjia M., 212 W. Va. 443, 448, 573 S.E.2d 354, 359\n(2002). Further, we have previously held that\n\n\n\n       3\n        The mother\u2019s parental rights were also terminated below. The permanency plan for the\nchildren is adoption.\n                                                  5\n\f       [i]n order to remedy the abuse and/or neglect problem, the problem must first be\n       acknowledged. Failure to acknowledge the existence of the problem, i.e., the truth\n       of the basic allegation pertaining to the alleged abuse and neglect or the perpetrator\n       of said abuse and neglect, results in making the problem untreatable and in making\n       an improvement period an exercise in futility at the child\u2019s expense.\n\nIn re Timber M., 231 W. Va. 44, 55, 743 S.E.2d 352, 363 (2013) (citation omitted).\n\n         In support of his argument, petitioner cites to In re S.J., A.J.-1, and A.J.-2, No. 18-0243,\n2018 WL 6119793 (W. Va. Nov. 21, 2018)(memorandum decision); however, this case does not\nsupport petitioner\u2019s claim that the circuit court erred in failing to grant him a post-adjudicatory\nimprovement period. In In re S.J., a circuit court found that a mother failed to accept responsibility\nfor abusing and neglecting her children and denied her motion for an improvement period. Id. at\n*2. However, the record in those proceedings did not support the circuit court\u2019s findings. Rather,\nin In re S.J., the DHHR worker who testified during the proceedings admitted she was unprepared\nto testify, did not prepare the mother\u2019s case plans, and had not even read the circuit court\u2019s\nadjudicatory order. Id. at *2. There are no such extenuating factors in these proceedings. In In re\nS.J., this Court also found that the record demonstrated that the mother accepted full responsibility\nfor her abuse and neglect. Id. at *4. Here, the record clearly demonstrates that petitioner refuses to\naccept full responsibility for his abuse and neglect of the children by repeatedly denying the\nallegations in the petition, despite the circuit court\u2019s findings in support of the same, and by\nblaming J.B. for initiating the proceedings. Therefore, the facts underlying the In re S.J. decision\nare wholly distinguishable from the facts in the case at bar.\n\n        Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, we see no error in the circuit court\u2019s determination that\npetitioner was not likely to fully participate in an improvement period. As noted above, the circuit\ncourt found that petitioner failed to accept responsibility for his drug abuse, domestic violence, or\npoor home conditions which led to the abuse and neglect of the children. Specifically, petitioner\naccused J.B. of fabricating the allegations and claimed she did so because he told her she was not\nallowed to date an older boy, despite ample testimony and evidence to the contrary, and the circuit\ncourt\u2019s findings in support of the same. While petitioner argues that he complied with services,\nremained drug free, and had a bond with the children, the record establishes that this is petitioner\u2019s\nthird CPS case and that he was provided improvement periods with extensive services on two prior\noccasions, yet regressed to his abusive behavior after the children were returned to his care.\nMoreover, the evaluating psychologist testified that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally\nadequate parenting was extremely poor given petitioner\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his\nactions and his past participation in abuse and neglect proceedings without any significant\nimprovement. Further, the DHHR maintains that there are no further services that could be offered\nto assist petitioner in improving his parenting. Therefore, we find that the circuit court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying petitioner an improvement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights. West Virginia\nCode \u00a7 49-4-604(c)(6) provides that circuit courts are to terminate parental rights upon finding\nthat there is \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future\u201d and that termination is necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. West\nVirginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d) provides that a circuit court may find that there is no reasonable\n\n                                                  6\n\flikelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect can be substantially corrected when the abusing\nparent has \u201cdemonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on [his\nor her] own or with help.\u201d\n\n        The record establishes that petitioner demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the\nproblems of abuse or neglect on his own or with help. As noted above, petitioner was provided an\nimprovement period in both of his prior cases, with services such as parenting and adult life skills\nclasses and counseling, but reverted to his abusive behavior each time the children were returned\nto his care. Indeed, the children were returned to petitioner in May of 2019, and the instant petition\nwas filed against him less than one year later, in January of 2020. While petitioner correctly asserts\nthat he complied with services and tested negative for drugs throughout the proceedings, he denied\nthe allegations of abuse, claimed J.B. was lying, and refused to accept responsibility for his actions.\nHowever, the circuit court found that J.B.\u2019s disclosures of abuse were credible and that petitioner\u2019s\ntestimony to the contrary was not credible. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist determined that\npetitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely poor and that it\nwas not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to his care. To the extent petitioner claims he\nshould have been granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the termination of his\nparental rights, we have held that\n\n               \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights, the most drastic remedy under the\n       statutory provision covering the disposition of neglected children, [West Virginia\n       Code \u00a7 49-4-604] may be employed without the use of intervening less restrictive\n       alternatives when it is found that there is no reasonable likelihood under [West\n       Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d)] that conditions of neglect or abuse can be\n       substantially corrected.\u201d Syllabus point 2, In re R.J.M., 164 W.Va. 496, 266 S.E.2d\n       114 (1980).\n\nSyl. Pt. 5, In re Kristin Y., 227 W. Va. 558, 712 S.E.2d 55 (2011). Given petitioner\u2019s failure to\nacknowledge the conditions of abuse and accept responsibility for his actions, we find that the\ncircuit court did not err in terminating his parental rights.\n\n       Lastly, because the DHHR has not yet found an adoptive placement for the children, this\nCourt reminds the circuit court of its duty to establish permanency for the children. Rule 39(b) of\nthe Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings requires:\n\n       At least once every three months until permanent placement is achieved as defined\n       in Rule 6, the court shall conduct a permanent placement review conference,\n       requiring the multidisciplinary treatment team to attend and report as to progress\n       and development in the case, for the purpose of reviewing the progress in the\n       permanent placement of the child.\n\n        Further, this Court reminds the circuit court of its duty pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of\nProcedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings to find permanent placement for the children\nwithin twelve months of the date of the dispositional order. As this Court has stated,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f                [t]he [twelve]-month period provided in Rule 43 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Procedure[ ] for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings for permanent placement\n       of an abused and neglected child following the final dispositional order must be\n       strictly followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances which are fully\n       substantiated in the record.\n\nCecil T., 228 W. Va. at 91, 717 S.E.2d at 875, syl. pt. 6. Moreover, this Court has stated that\n\n               [i]n determining the appropriate permanent out-of-home placement of a\n       child under [West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(6)], the circuit court shall give\n       priority to securing a suitable adoptive home for the child and shall consider other\n       placement alternatives, including permanent foster care, only where the court finds\n       that adoption would not provide custody, care, commitment, nurturing and\n       discipline consistent with the child\u2019s best interests or where a suitable adoptive\n       home [cannot] be found.\n\nSyl. Pt. 3, State v. Michael M., 202 W. Va. 350, 504 S.E.2d 177 (1998). Finally, \u201c[t]he guardian\nad litem\u2019s role in abuse and neglect proceedings does not actually cease until such time as the child\nis placed in a permanent home.\u201d Syl. Pt. 5, James M. v. Maynard, 185 W. Va. 648, 408 S.E.2d 400\n(1991).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the decision of the circuit court, and its March\n16, 2021, order is hereby affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                                           Affirmed.\n\nISSUED: October 1, 2021\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice Evan H.

Nanners, appeals the Circuit Court of\nWebster County\u2019s March 16, 2021, order terminating his parental rights to A.B.-1, P.B., J.B., and\nA.B.-2. 1 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d), by counsel\nPatrick Morrisey and Mindy M. Parsley, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\nThe guardian ad litem (\u201cguardian\u201d), Mary Elizabeth Snead, filed a response on behalf of the\nchildren also in support of the circuit court\u2019s order. On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt erred in denying him a post-adjudicatory improvement period and terminating his parental\nrights.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        Petitioner and the children\u2019s mother have a significant history of Child Protective Services\n(\u201cCPS\u201d) intervention. The DHHR filed a petition against the parents in 2013 due to their substance\nabuse, poor home conditions, and medical neglect of the children. The circuit court adjudicated\nthe parents as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement\nperiod, which they successfully completed. As such, the children were returned to their custody.\nSubsequently, in 2018, the DHHR filed another petition against the parents due to substance abuse,\npoor home conditions, and domestic violence. The circuit court again adjudicated them as abusing\n\n       1\n         Consistent with our long-standing practice in cases with sensitive facts, we use initials\nwhere necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case. See In re K.H., 235 W. Va.\n254, 773 S.E.2d 20 (2015); Melinda H. v. William R. II, 230 W. Va. 731, 742 S.E.2d 419 (2013);\nState v. Brandon B., 218 W. Va. 324, 624 S.E.2d 761 (2005); State v. Edward Charles L., 183 W.\nVa. 641, 398 S.E.2d 123 (1990). Because two of the children and petitioner share the same initials,\nwe will refer to them as A.B.-1, A.B.-2, and A.B.-3 respectively, throughout the memorandum\ndecision.\n                                                  1\n\fand neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement period. The parents also\ncompleted these improvement periods, and the children were returned to their custody in May of\n2019.\n\n        Only a few months later, in January of 2020, the DHHR filed the instant abuse and neglect\npetition against the parents. According to the DHHR, then fourteen-year-old J.B. disclosed to her\nschool principal that her mother choked her and hit her with a telephone. The child further\ndisclosed that the parents were abusing drugs, that she had seen a white powdery substance and a\nstraw on a countertop in the home, and that the home smelled of marijuana. J.B. further indicated\nthat she did not feel safe in the home. Following J.B.\u2019s disclosure, a CPS worker responded to the\nparents\u2019 home and informed them of the referral concerning possible drug use. The parents were\nagitated during the exchange and frequently went in and out of petitioner\u2019s parents\u2019 home, which\nwas next door, and refused to allow the CPS worker or law enforcement into their own home.\nEventually, the parents agreed to submit to a drug screen at the local hospital, which was positive\nfor oxycontin. Thereafter, the CPS worker petitioned for and received a ratification for emergency\ncustody of the children, who were placed with the paternal grandparents with instructions that no\ncontact between the children and the parents was to occur.\n\n        A few days later, J.B. informed a CPS worker that on the day her parents submitted to a\ndrug screen, they called the paternal grandparents\u2019 home to request that J.B. urinate in a cup and\nbring it to them so they would not \u201cgo to jail.\u201d J.B. indicated that the parents had previously asked\nher to urinate in a cup for them. She also disclosed that petitioner had been to the paternal\ngrandparents\u2019 home every day since the children had been removed from the parents\u2019 care and told\nthe children not to talk to CPS. Lastly, J.B. indicated that she chose to disclose the allegations\nagainst her parents because they had become increasingly aggressive with each other and had\nstruck the child P.B.\n\n        Based on this information, the DHHR alleged that the parents abused drugs, which\nnegatively affected their ability to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the children, and\nthat they failed to provide a fit and suitable home. An amended petition was filed shortly thereafter\nindicating that petitioner tested positive for methamphetamine following a hair follicle test.\n\n        The circuit court held an adjudicatory hearing in May of 2020. A CPS worker testified\nregarding the allegations in the petition, including J.B.\u2019s disclosures and the worker\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation into the matter. The CPS worker testified that J.B. reported drug abuse in the home\nand further testified that the parents tested positive for oxycontin on the day of the removal. A CPS\nsupervisor also testified regarding J.B.\u2019s disclosures stating that the child said that on the day the\nchildren were removed from the home, petitioner asked J.B. to urinate in a cup for him so that he\ncould use her urine to pass his drug test, and that he had asked J.B. do so on prior occasions.\nPetitioner\u2019s therapist testified that petitioner denied the allegations made by J.B. but admitted that\nhe later tested positive for methamphetamine through a hair follicle test.\n\n      Petitioner testified that J.B. fabricated the allegations against him and the mother because\nthey would not allow her to date an older boy. Petitioner admitted testing positive for\nmethamphetamine through the hair follicle test and explained that he \u201cslipped up one evening in\nNovember\u201d of 2019. Petitioner denied abusing oxycontin as alleged in the petition, noting that the\n\n                                                  2\n\fscreen was not sent for laboratory confirmation and that the hair follicle test had not shown traces\nof oxycontin. Petitioner denied further drug abuse and domestic violence in the home.\n\n       Following testimony, the circuit court noted that it had watched J.B.\u2019s Child Advocacy\nCenter interview and observed that the child was very hostile and angry; the court indicated that it\nconsidered her behavior in weighing the credibility of her statements. The circuit court also noted\ninconsistencies in the parents\u2019 testimony and ultimately determined that J.B.\u2019s disclosures were\ncredible. The circuit court found that the parents accused J.B. of making up the allegations against\nthem because they allegedly angered her by telling her that her boyfriend was too old for her, but\nthere was no evidence to support such an allegation. The circuit court further found that the parents\nengaged in domestic violence in the children\u2019s presence, abused drugs, and failed to maintain a fit\nand suitable home. Accordingly, the circuit court adjudicated petitioner as an abusing parent.\n\n       Subsequently, in October of 2020, the mother gave birth to A.B.-2, and the DHHR filed an\namended petition adding the child to the proceedings. 2 A.B.-2 was removed from petitioner\u2019s\ncustody at that time. The circuit court adjudicated the parents as abusing parents with regard to\nA.B.-2 in November of 2020.\n\n        The circuit court held a dispositional hearing in January of 2021. The DHHR presented the\ntestimony of the parents\u2019 counselor, who testified that she had previously provided counseling to\npetitioner during a prior case and had done so throughout the instant case, addressing issues such\nas substance abuse, parenting, anxiety, and depression. The counselor opined that petitioner made\nsome progress throughout the proceedings, was cooperating during the sessions, and was\nmotivated to change his behavior. However, the counselor acknowledged that the parents had been\ncontacting J.B. in violation of the court\u2019s order and that the mother was urging the child to \u201ctell\nthe truth\u201d by retracting her statements of abuse. Moreover, the counselor admitted that she did \u201cnot\ndisagree\u201d with a psychologist\u2019s determination that petitioner had an extremely poor prognosis of\nattaining minimally adequate parenting skills.\n\n        Next, J.B.\u2019s foster mother testified regarding contact between the child and the parents.\nThe foster mother explained that the parents were prohibited from contacting J.B., but that the\nchild admitted that she and the parents remained in contact via Facebook Messenger. J.B. disclosed\nthat before contact with her parents was prohibited, she attended a supervised visit wherein\npetitioner managed to slip a cellphone into her bag unnoticed by the service provider. The foster\nmother testified that she searched the child\u2019s bag, found the cellphone, and read messages sent to\nJ.B. by the parents. The foster mother stated that the parents were encouraging J.B. to change her\nstory and tell the DHHR that she fabricated the allegations against the parents.\n\n        The DHHR also called the evaluating psychologist to testify regarding her evaluations of\npetitioner, J.B., and A.B.-1. Regarding J.B., the psychologist testified that she diagnosed her with\nmajor depressive disorder due to her reported history of suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well as\nproblems related to sleep, worry, and self-esteem. When asked what the cause of these problems\ncould be, the psychologist stated that \u201cwhen a child, you know, of her age is having those types of\nsevere behaviors, including the cutting and the suicidal ideation, and those types of things, there\u2019s\n\n\n       2\n           Petitioner is the father of A.B.-2.\n                                                 3\n\falways a concern for the environment that she was in.\u201d The psychologist further opined that it\nwould be better \u201cin the long run\u201d for J.B. to not return to the parents\u2019 care based upon the number\nof removals and the fact that the parents failed to rectify the issues leading to the children\u2019s removal\nover multiple cases and with services. Likewise, the psychologist opined that it would not be in\nA.B.-1\u2019s best interest to be returned to the parents\u2019 care. The psychologist noted that A.B.-1 was\ndiagnosed with autism and cerebral palsy and required significant care. Further, A.B.-1 needed a\nstable, consistent home environment that would provide him with the services he needed. The\nevaluator also opined that petitioner blamed others instead of accepting responsibility for his\nactions, which indicated that he had little motivation to make long-term changes. The evaluator\nconcluded that \u201c[g]iven [petitioner\u2019s] lack of accountability, failure to correct the abuse and\nneglect present in the previous cases, failure to benefit from services, as well as long-term\nsubstance dependence, and lack of significant periods of sobriety, . . . [petitioner\u2019s] prognosis for\nimproved parenting . . . is extremely poor.\u201d The evaluator also stated that she was not aware of\nany additional services that could be provided to petitioner to correct the circumstances of abuse.\n\n       The DHHR\u2019s next witness, a service provider, testified that she provided the parents with\nparenting classes in both the 2018 case and the instant case. The service provider stated that the\nparents were cooperative and appeared to understand the concepts of the material taught but\ncontinued to deny the allegations against them, instead blaming J.B. for the situation. The service\nprovided further stated that petitioner denied giving J.B. a cellphone during a supervised visit. A\nCPS worker corroborated the service provider\u2019s testimony that petitioner was compliant with\nservices.\n\n        Petitioner presented the testimony of another service provider who supervised his visits\nwith the children. The provider testified that petitioner did well with the visits, appeared bonded\nwith the children, provided food and activities, and was loving towards the children. Petitioner\nrequested a post-adjudicatory improvement period. He testified that he complied with services,\nremained drug-free throughout the proceedings, and was deeply bonded with his children.\nPetitioner denied providing J.B. with a cellphone and communicating with her, stating that his wife\nwas the one who communicated with the child, unbeknownst to him. When asked what the issues\nof abuse and neglect were, petitioner stated that he could be \u201ccleanlier\u201d and that his drug use\n\u201cshould never have happened,\u201d but denied any domestic violence in the home.\n\n        Following respective counsel\u2019s arguments, the circuit court found that the children had\nbeen removed from the parents\u2019 care three times, but that petitioner failed to accept responsibility\nfor his actions and consistently blamed J.B. for the proceedings. Further, the issues in the instant\ncase included drug use and poor home conditions, which were identical to the issues in the prior\ntwo cases. While the parents accused J.B. of lying throughout the case, the circuit court found that\nsuch accusations were contrary to the evidence and further found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was\n\u201cless than credible.\u201d Ultimately, the circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s request for an improvement\nperiod and terminated his parental rights upon finding that there was no reasonable likelihood that\npetitioner could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near future and that termination\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fwas necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. Petitioner appeals the circuit court\u2019s March 16, 2021,\ndispositional order. 3\n\n       The Court has previously established the following standard of review in cases such as this:\n\n               \u201cAlthough conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to de\n       novo review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the\n       facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the\n       evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such\n       child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing\n       court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there\n       is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\n       with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However,\n       a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided\n       the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court\u2019s account of the\n       evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, In\n       Interest of Tiffany Marie S., 196 W.Va. 223, 470 S.E.2d 177 (1996).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, In re Cecil T., 228 W. Va. 89, 717 S.E.2d 873 (2011).\n\n        On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for an\nimprovement period and in terminating his parental rights. According to petitioner, he was fully\ncompliant with the services offered by the DHHR, remained drug-free throughout the proceedings,\nscheduled his own counseling and appointments, and appeared at all hearings and multidisciplinary\nteam meetings. Petitioner also argues that testimony established that he was cooperative and\ncompliant with services, had a bond with the children, and completed everything requested of him\nby the DHHR and the court. Based on the foregoing, petitioner contends that he met his burden of\nestablishing he was likely to participate in an improvement period, and further contends that there\nwas a reasonable likelihood that he could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near\nfuture.\n\n        The decision to grant or deny an improvement period rests in the sound discretion of the\ncircuit court. See In re M.M., 236 W. Va. 108, 115, 778 S.E.2d 338, 345 (2015) (\u201cWest Virginia\nlaw allows the circuit court discretion in deciding whether to grant a parent an improvement\nperiod.\u201d); Syl. Pt. 6, in part, In re Katie S., 198 W. Va. 79, 479 S.E.2d 589 (1996) (\u201cIt is within the\ncourt\u2019s discretion to grant an improvement period within the applicable statutory requirements[.]\u201d).\nWe have also held that a parent\u2019s \u201centitlement to an improvement period is conditioned upon the\nability of the [parent] to demonstrate \u2018by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is\nlikely to fully participate in the improvement period.\u2019\u201d In re Charity H., 215 W. Va. 208, 215, 599\nS.E.2d 631, 638 (2004). However, the circuit court has discretion to deny an improvement period\nwhen no improvement is likely. See In re Tonjia M., 212 W. Va. 443, 448, 573 S.E.2d 354, 359\n(2002). Further, we have previously held that\n\n\n\n       3\n        The mother\u2019s parental rights were also terminated below. The permanency plan for the\nchildren is adoption.\n                                                  5\n\f       [i]n order to remedy the abuse and/or neglect problem, the problem must first be\n       acknowledged. Failure to acknowledge the existence of the problem, i.e., the truth\n       of the basic allegation pertaining to the alleged abuse and neglect or the perpetrator\n       of said abuse and neglect, results in making the problem untreatable and in making\n       an improvement period an exercise in futility at the child\u2019s expense.\n\nIn re Timber M., 231 W. Va. 44, 55, 743 S.E.2d 352, 363 (2013) (citation omitted).\n\n         In support of his argument, petitioner cites to In re S.J., A.J.-1, and A.J.-2, No. 18-0243,\n2018 WL 6119793 (W. Va. Nov. 21, 2018)(memorandum decision); however, this case does not\nsupport petitioner\u2019s claim that the circuit court erred in failing to grant him a post-adjudicatory\nimprovement period. In In re S.J., a circuit court found that a mother failed to accept responsibility\nfor abusing and neglecting her children and denied her motion for an improvement period. Id. at\n*2. However, the record in those proceedings did not support the circuit court\u2019s findings. Rather,\nin In re S.J., the DHHR worker who testified during the proceedings admitted she was unprepared\nto testify, did not prepare the mother\u2019s case plans, and had not even read the circuit court\u2019s\nadjudicatory order. Id. at *2. There are no such extenuating factors in these proceedings. In In re\nS.J., this Court also found that the record demonstrated that the mother accepted full responsibility\nfor her abuse and neglect. Id. at *4. Here, the record clearly demonstrates that petitioner refuses to\naccept full responsibility for his abuse and neglect of the children by repeatedly denying the\nallegations in the petition, despite the circuit court\u2019s findings in support of the same, and by\nblaming J.B. for initiating the proceedings. Therefore, the facts underlying the In re S.J. decision\nare wholly distinguishable from the facts in the case at bar.\n\n        Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, we see no error in the circuit court\u2019s determination that\npetitioner was not likely to fully participate in an improvement period. As noted above, the circuit\ncourt found that petitioner failed to accept responsibility for his drug abuse, domestic violence, or\npoor home conditions which led to the abuse and neglect of the children. Specifically, petitioner\naccused J.B. of fabricating the allegations and claimed she did so because he told her she was not\nallowed to date an older boy, despite ample testimony and evidence to the contrary, and the circuit\ncourt\u2019s findings in support of the same. While petitioner argues that he complied with services,\nremained drug free, and had a bond with the children, the record establishes that this is petitioner\u2019s\nthird CPS case and that he was provided improvement periods with extensive services on two prior\noccasions, yet regressed to his abusive behavior after the children were returned to his care.\nMoreover, the evaluating psychologist testified that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally\nadequate parenting was extremely poor given petitioner\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his\nactions and his past participation in abuse and neglect proceedings without any significant\nimprovement. Further, the DHHR maintains that there are no further services that could be offered\nto assist petitioner in improving his parenting. Therefore, we find that the circuit court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying petitioner an improvement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights. West Virginia\nCode \u00a7 49-4-604(c)(6) provides that circuit courts are to terminate parental rights upon finding\nthat there is \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future\u201d and that termination is necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. West\nVirginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d) provides that a circuit court may find that there is no reasonable\n\n                                                  6\n\flikelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect can be substantially corrected when the abusing\nparent has \u201cdemonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on [his\nor her] own or with help.\u201d\n\n        The record establishes that petitioner demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the\nproblems of abuse or neglect on his own or with help. As noted above, petitioner was provided an\nimprovement period in both of his prior cases, with services such as parenting and adult life skills\nclasses and counseling, but reverted to his abusive behavior each time the children were returned\nto his care. Indeed, the children were returned to petitioner in May of 2019, and the instant petition\nwas filed against him less than one year later, in January of 2020. While petitioner correctly asserts\nthat he complied with services and tested negative for drugs throughout the proceedings, he denied\nthe allegations of abuse, claimed J.B. was lying, and refused to accept responsibility for his actions.\nHowever, the circuit court found that J.B.\u2019s disclosures of abuse were credible and that petitioner\u2019s\ntestimony to the contrary was not credible. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist determined that\npetitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely poor and that it\nwas not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to his care. To the extent petitioner claims he\nshould have been granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the termination of his\nparental rights, we have held that\n\n               \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights, the most drastic remedy under the\n       statutory provision covering the disposition of neglected children, [West Virginia\n       Code \u00a7 49-4-604] may be employed without the use of intervening less restrictive\n       alternatives when it is found that there is no reasonable likelihood under [West\n       Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d)] that conditions of neglect or abuse can be\n       substantially corrected.\u201d Syllabus point 2, In re R.J.M., 164 W.Va. 496, 266 S.E.2d\n       114 (1980).\n\nSyl. Pt. 5, In re Kristin Y., 227 W. Va. 558, 712 S.E.2d 55 (2011). Given petitioner\u2019s failure to\nacknowledge the conditions of abuse and accept responsibility for his actions, we find that the\ncircuit court did not err in terminating his parental rights.\n\n       Lastly, because the DHHR has not yet found an adoptive placement for the children, this\nCourt reminds the circuit court of its duty to establish permanency for the children. Rule 39(b) of\nthe Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings requires:\n\n       At least once every three months until permanent placement is achieved as defined\n       in Rule 6, the court shall conduct a permanent placement review conference,\n       requiring the multidisciplinary treatment team to attend and report as to progress\n       and development in the case, for the purpose of reviewing the progress in the\n       permanent placement of the child.\n\n        Further, this Court reminds the circuit court of its duty pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of\nProcedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings to find permanent placement for the children\nwithin twelve months of the date of the dispositional order. As this Court has stated,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f                [t]he [twelve]-month period provided in Rule 43 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Procedure[ ] for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings for permanent placement\n       of an abused and neglected child following the final dispositional order must be\n       strictly followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances which are fully\n       substantiated in the record.\n\nCecil T., 228 W. Va. at 91, 717 S.E.2d at 875, syl. pt. 6. Moreover, this Court has stated that\n\n               [i]n determining the appropriate permanent out-of-home placement of a\n       child under [West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(6)], the circuit court shall give\n       priority to securing a suitable adoptive home for the child and shall consider other\n       placement alternatives, including permanent foster care, only where the court finds\n       that adoption would not provide custody, care, commitment, nurturing and\n       discipline consistent with the child\u2019s best interests or where a suitable adoptive\n       home [cannot] be found.\n\nSyl. Pt. 3, State v. Michael M., 202 W. Va. 350, 504 S.E.2d 177 (1998). Finally, \u201c[t]he guardian\nad litem\u2019s role in abuse and neglect proceedings does not actually cease until such time as the child\nis placed in a permanent home.\u201d Syl. Pt. 5, James M. v. Maynard, 185 W. Va. 648, 408 S.E.2d 400\n(1991).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the decision of the circuit court, and its March\n16, 2021, order is hereby affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                                           Affirmed.\n\nISSUED: October 1, 2021\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice Evan H.

Nanners, appeals the Circuit Court of\nWebster County\u2019s March 16, 2021, order terminating his parental rights to A.B.-1, P.B., J.B., and\nA.B.-2. 1 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d), by counsel\nPatrick Morrisey and Mindy M. Parsley, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\nThe guardian ad litem (\u201cguardian\u201d), Mary Elizabeth Snead, filed a response on behalf of the\nchildren also in support of the circuit court\u2019s order. On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt erred in denying him a post-adjudicatory improvement period and terminating his parental\nrights.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        Petitioner and the children\u2019s mother have a significant history of Child Protective Services\n(\u201cCPS\u201d) intervention. The DHHR filed a petition against the parents in 2013 due to their substance\nabuse, poor home conditions, and medical neglect of the children. The circuit court adjudicated\nthe parents as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement\nperiod, which they successfully completed. As such, the children were returned to their custody.\nSubsequently, in 2018, the DHHR filed another petition against the parents due to substance abuse,\npoor home conditions, and domestic violence. The circuit court again adjudicated them as abusing\n\n       1\n         Consistent with our long-standing practice in cases with sensitive facts, we use initials\nwhere necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case.

Because two of the children and petitioner share the same initials,\nwe will refer to them as A.B.-1, A.B.-2, and A.B.-3 respectively, throughout the memorandum\ndecision.\n                                                  1\n\fand neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement period. The parents also\ncompleted these improvement periods, and the children were returned to their custody in May of\n2019.\n\n        Only a few months later, in January of 2020, the DHHR filed the instant abuse and neglect\npetition against the parents. According to the DHHR, then fourteen-year-old J.B. disclosed to her\nschool principal that her mother choked her and hit her with a telephone. The child further\ndisclosed that the parents were abusing drugs, that she had seen a white powdery substance and a\nstraw on a countertop in the home, and that the home smelled of marijuana. J.B. further indicated\nthat she did not feel safe in the home. Following J.B.\u2019s disclosure, a CPS worker responded to the\nparents\u2019 home and informed them of the referral concerning possible drug use. The parents were\nagitated during the exchange and frequently went in and out of petitioner\u2019s parents\u2019 home, which\nwas next door, and refused to allow the CPS worker or law enforcement into their own home.\nEventually, the parents agreed to submit to a drug screen at the local hospital, which was positive\nfor oxycontin. Thereafter, the CPS worker petitioned for and received a ratification for emergency\ncustody of the children, who were placed with the paternal grandparents with instructions that no\ncontact between the children and the parents was to occur.\n\n        A few days later, J.B. informed a CPS worker that on the day her parents submitted to a\ndrug screen, they called the paternal grandparents\u2019 home to request that J.B. urinate in a cup and\nbring it to them so they would not \u201cgo to jail.\u201d J.B. indicated that the parents had previously asked\nher to urinate in a cup for them. She also disclosed that petitioner had been to the paternal\ngrandparents\u2019 home every day since the children had been removed from the parents\u2019 care and told\nthe children not to talk to CPS. Lastly, J.B. indicated that she chose to disclose the allegations\nagainst her parents because they had become increasingly aggressive with each other and had\nstruck the child P.B.\n\n        Based on this information, the DHHR alleged that the parents abused drugs, which\nnegatively affected their ability to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the children, and\nthat they failed to provide a fit and suitable home. An amended petition was filed shortly thereafter\nindicating that petitioner tested positive for methamphetamine following a hair follicle test.\n\n        The circuit court held an adjudicatory hearing in May of 2020. A CPS worker testified\nregarding the allegations in the petition, including J.B.\u2019s disclosures and the worker\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation into the matter. The CPS worker testified that J.B. reported drug abuse in the home\nand further testified that the parents tested positive for oxycontin on the day of the removal. A CPS\nsupervisor also testified regarding J.B.\u2019s disclosures stating that the child said that on the day the\nchildren were removed from the home, petitioner asked J.B. to urinate in a cup for him so that he\ncould use her urine to pass his drug test, and that he had asked J.B. do so on prior occasions.\nPetitioner\u2019s therapist testified that petitioner denied the allegations made by J.B. but admitted that\nhe later tested positive for methamphetamine through a hair follicle test.\n\n      Petitioner testified that J.B. fabricated the allegations against him and the mother because\nthey would not allow her to date an older boy. Petitioner admitted testing positive for\nmethamphetamine through the hair follicle test and explained that he \u201cslipped up one evening in\nNovember\u201d of 2019. Petitioner denied abusing oxycontin as alleged in the petition, noting that the\n\n                                                  2\n\fscreen was not sent for laboratory confirmation and that the hair follicle test had not shown traces\nof oxycontin. Petitioner denied further drug abuse and domestic violence in the home.\n\n       Following testimony, the circuit court noted that it had watched J.B.\u2019s Child Advocacy\nCenter interview and observed that the child was very hostile and angry; the court indicated that it\nconsidered her behavior in weighing the credibility of her statements. The circuit court also noted\ninconsistencies in the parents\u2019 testimony and ultimately determined that J.B.\u2019s disclosures were\ncredible. The circuit court found that the parents accused J.B. of making up the allegations against\nthem because they allegedly angered her by telling her that her boyfriend was too old for her, but\nthere was no evidence to support such an allegation. The circuit court further found that the parents\nengaged in domestic violence in the children\u2019s presence, abused drugs, and failed to maintain a fit\nand suitable home. Accordingly, the circuit court adjudicated petitioner as an abusing parent.\n\n       Subsequently, in October of 2020, the mother gave birth to A.B.-2, and the DHHR filed an\namended petition adding the child to the proceedings. 2 A.B.-2 was removed from petitioner\u2019s\ncustody at that time. The circuit court adjudicated the parents as abusing parents with regard to\nA.B.-2 in November of 2020.\n\n        The circuit court held a dispositional hearing in January of 2021. The DHHR presented the\ntestimony of the parents\u2019 counselor, who testified that she had previously provided counseling to\npetitioner during a prior case and had done so throughout the instant case, addressing issues such\nas substance abuse, parenting, anxiety, and depression. The counselor opined that petitioner made\nsome progress throughout the proceedings, was cooperating during the sessions, and was\nmotivated to change his behavior. However, the counselor acknowledged that the parents had been\ncontacting J.B. in violation of the court\u2019s order and that the mother was urging the child to \u201ctell\nthe truth\u201d by retracting her statements of abuse. Moreover, the counselor admitted that she did \u201cnot\ndisagree\u201d with a psychologist\u2019s determination that petitioner had an extremely poor prognosis of\nattaining minimally adequate parenting skills.\n\n        Next, J.B.\u2019s foster mother testified regarding contact between the child and the parents.\nThe foster mother explained that the parents were prohibited from contacting J.B., but that the\nchild admitted that she and the parents remained in contact via Facebook Messenger. J.B. disclosed\nthat before contact with her parents was prohibited, she attended a supervised visit wherein\npetitioner managed to slip a cellphone into her bag unnoticed by the service provider. The foster\nmother testified that she searched the child\u2019s bag, found the cellphone, and read messages sent to\nJ.B. by the parents. The foster mother stated that the parents were encouraging J.B. to change her\nstory and tell the DHHR that she fabricated the allegations against the parents.\n\n        The DHHR also called the evaluating psychologist to testify regarding her evaluations of\npetitioner, J.B., and A.B.-1. Regarding J.B., the psychologist testified that she diagnosed her with\nmajor depressive disorder due to her reported history of suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well as\nproblems related to sleep, worry, and self-esteem. When asked what the cause of these problems\ncould be, the psychologist stated that \u201cwhen a child, you know, of her age is having those types of\nsevere behaviors, including the cutting and the suicidal ideation, and those types of things, there\u2019s\n\n\n       2\n           Petitioner is the father of A.B.-2.\n                                                 3\n\falways a concern for the environment that she was in.\u201d The psychologist further opined that it\nwould be better \u201cin the long run\u201d for J.B. to not return to the parents\u2019 care based upon the number\nof removals and the fact that the parents failed to rectify the issues leading to the children\u2019s removal\nover multiple cases and with services. Likewise, the psychologist opined that it would not be in\nA.B.-1\u2019s best interest to be returned to the parents\u2019 care. The psychologist noted that A.B.-1 was\ndiagnosed with autism and cerebral palsy and required significant care. Further, A.B.-1 needed a\nstable, consistent home environment that would provide him with the services he needed. The\nevaluator also opined that petitioner blamed others instead of accepting responsibility for his\nactions, which indicated that he had little motivation to make long-term changes. The evaluator\nconcluded that \u201c[g]iven [petitioner\u2019s] lack of accountability, failure to correct the abuse and\nneglect present in the previous cases, failure to benefit from services, as well as long-term\nsubstance dependence, and lack of significant periods of sobriety, . . . [petitioner\u2019s] prognosis for\nimproved parenting . . . is extremely poor.\u201d The evaluator also stated that she was not aware of\nany additional services that could be provided to petitioner to correct the circumstances of abuse.\n\n       The DHHR\u2019s next witness, a service provider, testified that she provided the parents with\nparenting classes in both the 2018 case and the instant case. The service provider stated that the\nparents were cooperative and appeared to understand the concepts of the material taught but\ncontinued to deny the allegations against them, instead blaming J.B. for the situation. The service\nprovided further stated that petitioner denied giving J.B. a cellphone during a supervised visit. A\nCPS worker corroborated the service provider\u2019s testimony that petitioner was compliant with\nservices.\n\n        Petitioner presented the testimony of another service provider who supervised his visits\nwith the children. The provider testified that petitioner did well with the visits, appeared bonded\nwith the children, provided food and activities, and was loving towards the children. Petitioner\nrequested a post-adjudicatory improvement period. He testified that he complied with services,\nremained drug-free throughout the proceedings, and was deeply bonded with his children.\nPetitioner denied providing J.B. with a cellphone and communicating with her, stating that his wife\nwas the one who communicated with the child, unbeknownst to him. When asked what the issues\nof abuse and neglect were, petitioner stated that he could be \u201ccleanlier\u201d and that his drug use\n\u201cshould never have happened,\u201d but denied any domestic violence in the home.\n\n        Following respective counsel\u2019s arguments, the circuit court found that the children had\nbeen removed from the parents\u2019 care three times, but that petitioner failed to accept responsibility\nfor his actions and consistently blamed J.B. for the proceedings. Further, the issues in the instant\ncase included drug use and poor home conditions, which were identical to the issues in the prior\ntwo cases. While the parents accused J.B. of lying throughout the case, the circuit court found that\nsuch accusations were contrary to the evidence and further found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was\n\u201cless than credible.\u201d Ultimately, the circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s request for an improvement\nperiod and terminated his parental rights upon finding that there was no reasonable likelihood that\npetitioner could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near future and that termination\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fwas necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. Petitioner appeals the circuit court\u2019s March 16, 2021,\ndispositional order. 3\n\n       The Court has previously established the following standard of review in cases such as this:\n\n               \u201cAlthough conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to de\n       novo review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the\n       facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the\n       evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such\n       child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing\n       court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there\n       is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\n       with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However,\n       a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided\n       the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court\u2019s account of the\n       evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d Syl.

According to petitioner, he was fully\ncompliant with the services offered by the DHHR, remained drug-free throughout the proceedings,\nscheduled his own counseling and appointments, and appeared at all hearings and multidisciplinary\nteam meetings. Petitioner also argues that testimony established that he was cooperative and\ncompliant with services, had a bond with the children, and completed everything requested of him\nby the DHHR and the court. Based on the foregoing, petitioner contends that he met his burden of\nestablishing he was likely to participate in an improvement period, and further contends that there\nwas a reasonable likelihood that he could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near\nfuture.\n\n        The decision to grant or deny an improvement period rests in the sound discretion of the\ncircuit court. See In re M.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">236 W.

Further, we have previously held that\n\n\n\n       3\n        The mother\u2019s parental rights were also terminated below. The permanency plan for the\nchildren is adoption.\n                                                  5\n\f       [i]n order to remedy the abuse and/or neglect problem, the problem must first be\n       acknowledged. Failure to acknowledge the existence of the problem, i.e., the truth\n       of the basic allegation pertaining to the alleged abuse and neglect or the perpetrator\n       of said abuse and neglect, results in making the problem untreatable and in making\n       an improvement period an exercise in futility at the child\u2019s expense.\n\nIn re Timber M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">231 W. Va. 44</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">743 S.E.2d 352</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (2013) (citation omitted).\n\n         In support of his argument, petitioner cites to In re S.J., A.J.-1, and A.J.-2, No. 18-0243,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2018 WL 6119793</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W. Va. Nov. 21, 2018)(memorandum decision); however, this case does not\nsupport petitioner\u2019s claim that the circuit court erred in failing to grant him a post-adjudicatory\nimprovement period. In In re S.J., a circuit court found that a mother failed to accept responsibility\nfor abusing and neglecting her children and denied her motion for an improvement period. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at\n*2</span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, the record in those proceedings did not support the circuit court\u2019s findings. Rather,\nin In re S.J., the DHHR worker who testified during the proceedings admitted she was unprepared\nto testify, did not prepare the mother\u2019s case plans, and had not even read the circuit court\u2019s\nadjudicatory order. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *2</span><pre class=\"inline\">. There are no such extenuating factors in these proceedings. In In re\nS.J., this Court also found that the record demonstrated that the mother accepted full responsibility\nfor her abuse and neglect. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *4</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Here, the record clearly demonstrates that petitioner refuses to\naccept full responsibility for his abuse and neglect of the children by repeatedly denying the\nallegations in the petition, despite the circuit court\u2019s findings in support of the same, and by\nblaming J.B. for initiating the proceedings. Therefore, the facts underlying the In re S.J. decision\nare wholly distinguishable from the facts in the case at bar.\n\n        Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, we see no error in the circuit court\u2019s determination that\npetitioner was not likely to fully participate in an improvement period. As noted above, the circuit\ncourt found that petitioner failed to accept responsibility for his drug abuse, domestic violence, or\npoor home conditions which led to the abuse and neglect of the children. Specifically, petitioner\naccused J.B. of fabricating the allegations and claimed she did so because he told her she was not\nallowed to date an older boy, despite ample testimony and evidence to the contrary, and the circuit\ncourt\u2019s findings in support of the same. While petitioner argues that he complied with services,\nremained drug free, and had a bond with the children, the record establishes that this is petitioner\u2019s\nthird CPS case and that he was provided improvement periods with extensive services on two prior\noccasions, yet regressed to his abusive behavior after the children were returned to his care.\nMoreover, the evaluating psychologist testified that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally\nadequate parenting was extremely poor given petitioner\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his\nactions and his past participation in abuse and neglect proceedings without any significant\nimprovement. Further, the DHHR maintains that there are no further services that could be offered\nto assist petitioner in improving his parenting. Therefore, we find that the circuit court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying petitioner an improvement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights. West Virginia\nCode \u00a7 49-4-604(c)(6) provides that circuit courts are to terminate parental rights upon finding\nthat there is \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future\u201d and that termination is necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. West\nVirginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d) provides that a circuit court may find that there is no reasonable\n\n                                                  6\n\flikelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect can be substantially corrected when the abusing\nparent has \u201cdemonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on [his\nor her] own or with help.\u201d\n\n        The record establishes that petitioner demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the\nproblems of abuse or neglect on his own or with help. As noted above, petitioner was provided an\nimprovement period in both of his prior cases, with services such as parenting and adult life skills\nclasses and counseling, but reverted to his abusive behavior each time the children were returned\nto his care. Indeed, the children were returned to petitioner in May of 2019, and the instant petition\nwas filed against him less than one year later, in January of 2020. While petitioner correctly asserts\nthat he complied with services and tested negative for drugs throughout the proceedings, he denied\nthe allegations of abuse, claimed J.B. was lying, and refused to accept responsibility for his actions.\nHowever, the circuit court found that J.B.\u2019s disclosures of abuse were credible and that petitioner\u2019s\ntestimony to the contrary was not credible. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist determined that\npetitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely poor and that it\nwas not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to his care. To the extent petitioner claims he\nshould have been granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the termination of his\nparental rights, we have held that\n\n               \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights, the most drastic remedy under the\n       statutory provision covering the disposition of neglected children, [West Virginia\n       Code \u00a7 49-4-604] may be employed without the use of intervening less restrictive\n       alternatives when it is found that there is no reasonable likelihood under [West\n       Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d)] that conditions of neglect or abuse can be\n       substantially corrected.\u201d Syllabus point 2, In re R.J.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 W.Va. 496</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265798\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265798/in-re-rjm/\">266 S.E.2d\n       114</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980).\n\nSyl.

Given petitioner\u2019s failure to\nacknowledge the conditions of abuse and accept responsibility for his actions, we find that the\ncircuit court did not err in terminating his parental rights.\n\n       Lastly, because the DHHR has not yet found an adoptive placement for the children, this\nCourt reminds the circuit court of its duty to establish permanency for the children. Rule 39(b) of\nthe Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings requires:\n\n       At least once every three months until permanent placement is achieved as defined\n       in Rule 6, the court shall conduct a permanent placement review conference,\n       requiring the multidisciplinary treatment team to attend and report as to progress\n       and development in the case, for the purpose of reviewing the progress in the\n       permanent placement of the child.\n\n        Further, this Court reminds the circuit court of its duty pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of\nProcedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings to find permanent placement for the children\nwithin twelve months of the date of the dispositional order. As this Court has stated,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f                [t]he [twelve]-month period provided in Rule 43 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Procedure[ ] for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings for permanent placement\n       of an abused and neglected child following the final dispositional order must be\n       strictly followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances which are fully\n       substantiated in the record.\n\nCecil T., 228 W.

Chattin, appeals the Circuit Court of\nWebster County\u2019s March 16, 2021, order terminating her parental rights to A.B.-1, P.B., J.B., and\nA.B.-2. 1 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d), by counsel\nPatrick Morrisey and Mindy M. Parsley, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\nThe guardian ad litem (\u201cguardian\u201d), Mary Elizabeth Snead, filed a response on behalf of the\nchildren also in support of the circuit court\u2019s order. On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt erred in denying her a post-adjudicatory improvement period and terminating her parental\nrights.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        Petitioner and the children\u2019s father have a significant history of Child Protective Services\n(\u201cCPS\u201d) intervention. The DHHR filed a petition against the parents in 2013 due to their substance\nabuse, poor home conditions, and medical neglect of the children. The circuit court adjudicated\nthe parents as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement\nperiod, which they successfully completed. As such, the children were returned to the parents\u2019\ncustody. Subsequently, in 2018, the DHHR filed another petition against the parents due to\nsubstance abuse, poor home conditions, and domestic violence. The circuit court again adjudicated\nthem as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement period.\n\n       1\n         Consistent with our long-standing practice in cases with sensitive facts, we use initials\nwhere necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case. See In re K.H., 235 W. Va.\n254, 773 S.E.2d 20 (2015); Melinda H. v. William R. II, 230 W. Va. 731, 742 S.E.2d 419 (2013);\nState v. Brandon B., 218 W. Va. 324, 624 S.E.2d 761 (2005); State v. Edward Charles L., 183 W.\nVa. 641, 398 S.E.2d 123 (1990). Because two of the children share the same initials, we will refer\nto them as A.B.-1 and A.B.-2 respectively, throughout the memorandum decision.\n                                                  1\n\fThe parents also completed these improvement periods, and the children were returned to their\ncustody in May of 2019.\n\n        Only a few months later, in January of 2020, the DHHR filed the instant abuse and neglect\npetition against the parents. According to the DHHR, then fourteen-year-old J.B. disclosed to her\nschool principal that petitioner choked her and hit her with a telephone. The child further disclosed\nthat the parents were abusing drugs, that she had seen a white powdery substance and a straw on a\ncountertop in the home, and that the home smelled of marijuana. J.B. further indicated that she did\nnot feel safe in the home. Following J.B.\u2019s disclosures, a CPS worker responded to the parents\u2019\nhome and informed them of the referral concerning possible drug use. The parents were agitated\nduring the exchange and frequently went in and out of the paternal grandparents\u2019 home, which was\nnext door; they refused to allow the CPS worker or law enforcement into their own home.\nEventually, the parents agreed to submit to a drug screen at a local hospital, which was positive\nfor oxycontin. Thereafter, the CPS worker petitioned for and received a ratification for emergency\ncustody of the children, who were placed with the paternal grandparents with instructions that no\ncontact between the children and the parents was to occur.\n\n        A few days later, J.B. informed a CPS worker that on the day her parents submitted to a\ndrug screen, they called the paternal grandparents\u2019 home and requested that J.B. urinate in a cup\nand bring it to them so they would not \u201cgo to jail.\u201d J.B. indicated that the parents had previously\nasked her to urinate in a cup for them. J.B. also disclosed that the parents had been to the paternal\ngrandparents\u2019 home every day since the children had been removed from the parents\u2019 care and told\nthem not to talk to CPS. Lastly, J.B. indicated that she decided to disclose the allegations against\nthe parents because they had become increasingly aggressive with each other and had struck the\nchild P.B.\n\n        Based on this information, the DHHR alleged that the parents abused drugs, which\nnegatively affected their ability to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the children, and\nthat they failed to provide a fit and suitable home.\n\n        The circuit court held an adjudicatory hearing in May of 2020. A CPS worker testified\nregarding the allegations in the petition, including J.B.\u2019s disclosures and the worker\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation into the matter. The CPS worker testified that J.B. reported that petitioner tried to\nchoke her and that the parents abused drugs in the home. The worker further testified that the\nparents tested positive for oxycontin on the day of the removal. A CPS supervisor also testified\nregarding J.B.\u2019s disclosures stating that the child said that on the day the children were removed\nfrom the home, petitioner asked J.B. to urinate in a cup for her so that she could use J.B.\u2019s urine to\npass the drug test, and that the father had asked J.B. to do so on prior occasions.\n\n       Petitioner testified that J.B. fabricated the allegations against her and the father because\nthey would not allow her to date an older boy. Petitioner denied choking or hitting J.B. and denied\nabusing drugs, noting that the screen she submitted to on the day of the children\u2019s removal was\nnot sent for laboratory confirmation and that her hair follicle test had not shown traces of any\nsubstance. Petitioner also denied asking J.B. to urinate in a cup so that she could pass a drug screen.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Following testimony, the circuit court noted that it had watched J.B.\u2019s Child Advocacy\nCenter interview and observed that the child was very hostile and angry. It further indicated that it\nconsidered her behavior in weighing the credibility of her statements. The circuit court also noted\ninconsistencies in the parents\u2019 testimony and ultimately determined that J.B.\u2019s disclosures were\ncredible. The circuit court found that the parents accused J.B. of making up the allegations against\nthem because they allegedly angered her by telling her that her boyfriend was too old for her, but\nthere was no evidence to support such an allegation. The circuit court further found that the parents\nengaged in domestic violence in the children\u2019s presence, abused drugs, and failed to maintain a fit\nand suitable home. Accordingly, the circuit court adjudicated petitioner as an abusing parent.\n\n       Subsequently, in October of 2020, petitioner gave birth to A.B.-2, and the DHHR filed an\namended petition adding the child to the proceedings. A.B.-2 was removed from petitioner\u2019s\ncustody at that time. The circuit court adjudicated the parents as abusing parents with regard to\nA.B.-2 in November of 2020.\n\n        The circuit court held a dispositional hearing in January of 2021. The DHHR presented the\ntestimony of the parents\u2019 counselor, who testified that she provided counseling to petitioner during\na prior case and had done so throughout the instant case, addressing issues such as substance abuse,\nparenting, anxiety, and depression. The counselor opined that petitioner made some progress\nthroughout the proceedings, was cooperating during the sessions, and was motivated to change her\nbehavior. However, the counselor acknowledged that the parents had been contacting J.B. in\nviolation of the court\u2019s order, and that petitioner was urging the child to \u201ctell the truth\u201d by retracting\nher allegations of abuse. Moreover, the counselor admitted that she did \u201cnot disagree\u201d with a\npsychologist\u2019s determination that petitioner had an extremely poor prognosis of attaining\nminimally adequate parenting skills.\n\n         Next, J.B.\u2019s foster mother testified regarding contact between the child and the parents.\nThe foster mother explained that the parents were prohibited from contacting J.B. but that the child\nadmitted that she and the parents remained in contact via Facebook Messenger. J.B. disclosed that\nbefore contact with her parents was prohibited, she attended a supervised visit wherein the father\nmanaged to slip a cellphone into her bag unnoticed by the service provider. The foster mother\ntestified that she searched the child\u2019s bag, found the cellphone, and read messages sent to J.B. by\nthe parents. The foster mother stated that the parents were encouraging J.B. to change her story\nand tell the DHHR that she fabricated the allegations against the parents.\n\n        The DHHR also called the evaluating psychologist to testify regarding her evaluations of\npetitioner, J.B., and A.B.-1. Regarding J.B., the psychologist testified that she diagnosed her with\nmajor depressive disorder based on her reported history of suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well\nas problems related to sleep, worry, and self-esteem. When asked what the cause of these problems\ncould be, the psychologist stated that \u201cwhen a child . . . of her age is having those types of severe\nbehaviors, including the cutting and the suicidal ideation, and those types of things, there\u2019s always\na concern for the environment that she was in.\u201d The psychologist further opined that it would be\nbetter \u201cin the long run\u201d for J.B. to not return to the parents\u2019 care based upon the number of removals\nand the fact that the parents failed to rectify the issues leading to the children\u2019s removal over\nmultiple cases and services. Likewise, the psychologist opined that it would not be in A.B.-1\u2019s best\ninterest to be returned to the parents\u2019 care. The psychologist noted that A.B.-1 was diagnosed with\n\n                                                    3\n\fautism and cerebral palsy and required significant care. Further, A.B.-1 needed a stable, consistent\nhome environment that would provide him with the services he needed. Regarding petitioner\u2019s\nevaluation, the evaluator opined that petitioner blamed others instead of accepting responsibility\nfor her actions, which indicated that she had little motivation to make long-term changes. The\nevaluator concluded that, \u201c[g]iven [petitioner\u2019s] lack of accountability, her failure to correct the\nabuse and neglect present in the previous cases, failure to benefit from services, as well as long-\nterm substance dependence, and lack of significant periods of sobriety, . . . [petitioner\u2019s] prognosis\nfor improved parenting . . . is extremely poor.\u201d The evaluator also stated that she was not aware of\nany additional services that could be provided to petitioner to correct the circumstances of abuse.\n\n        The DHHR\u2019s next witness, a service provider, testified that she provided the parents with\nparenting classes in both the 2018 case and the instant case. The service provider stated that the\nparents were cooperative and appeared to understand the concepts of the material taught but\ncontinued to deny the allegations against them, instead blaming J.B. for the situation. The service\nprovided further stated that petitioner denied any knowledge of the father giving J.B. a cellphone\nduring a supervised visit. A CPS worker corroborated the service provider\u2019s testimony that\npetitioner was compliant with services.\n\n        Petitioner requested a post-adjudicatory improvement period. She testified that she\ncomplied with services, remained drug-free throughout the proceedings, and loved her children.\nHowever, petitioner maintained that J.B. fabricated the allegations against her. Petitioner denied\nthat she or the father provided J.B. with a cellphone during a supervised visit and claimed that the\nchild must have stolen the phone out of petitioner\u2019s car. Petitioner acknowledged that she\ncommunicated with the child in violation of the court\u2019s order but denied asking the child to change\nher story; rather, petitioner claimed she asked the child to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\n\n        Following respective counsel\u2019s arguments, the circuit court found that the children had\nbeen removed from the parents\u2019 care three times and that petitioner failed to accept responsibility\nfor her actions, consistently blaming J.B. for the proceedings. Further, the issues in the instant case\nincluded drug use and poor home conditions, which were identical to the issues in the prior two\ncases. While the parents accused J.B. of lying throughout the case, the circuit court found that such\naccusations were contrary to the evidence and further found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was \u201cless\nthan credible.\u201d Ultimately, the circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s request for an improvement period\nand terminated her parental rights upon finding that there was no reasonable likelihood that\npetitioner could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near future and that termination\nwas necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. Petitioner appeals the circuit court\u2019s March 16, 2021,\ndispositional order. 2\n\n       The Court has previously established the following standard of review in cases such as this:\n\n              \u201cAlthough conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to de\n       novo review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the\n       facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the\n\n\n       2\n        The father\u2019s parental rights were also terminated below. The permanency plan for the\nchildren is adoption.\n                                                  4\n\f       evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such\n       child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing\n       court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there\n       is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\n       with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However,\n       a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided\n       the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court\u2019s account of the\n       evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, In\n       Interest of Tiffany Marie S., 196 W.Va. 223, 470 S.E.2d 177 (1996).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, In re Cecil T., 228 W. Va. 89, 717 S.E.2d 873 (2011).\n\n         On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit court erred in terminating her parental rights\nwithout first granting her an improvement period. Petitioner acknowledges that she was\nadjudicated based upon drug abuse and domestic violence in the home but maintains that there was\nno drug abuse or domestic violence as alleged. Petitioner testified during the proceedings below\nthat J.B. fabricated the allegations because she was not permitted to date an older boy. It is\nuncontroverted that petitioner had no positive confirmed drug use during the entirety of this case\nand that she complied with all services offered, including counseling, drug screening, and\nvisitation. As such, petitioner contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in not granting\nher an improvement period prior to terminating her parental rights. Petitioner avers that there was\na reasonable likelihood that she could have corrected the conditions of abuse which led to the filing\nof the petition, as she was willing to comply with all directives of the circuit court. In looking at\nthe evidence of petitioner\u2019s compliance throughout the case, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt\u2019s findings and the termination of her parental rights was clearly erroneous and contrary to\nthe evidence.\n\n        The decision to grant or deny an improvement period rests in the sound discretion of the\ncircuit court. See In re M.M., 236 W. Va. 108, 115, 778 S.E.2d 338, 345 (2015) (\u201cWest Virginia\nlaw allows the circuit court discretion in deciding whether to grant a parent an improvement\nperiod.\u201d); Syl. Pt. 6, in part, In re Katie S., 198 W. Va. 79, 479 S.E.2d 589 (1996) (\u201cIt is within the\ncourt\u2019s discretion to grant an improvement period within the applicable statutory requirements[.]\u201d).\nWe have also held that a parent\u2019s \u201centitlement to an improvement period is conditioned upon the\nability of the [parent] to demonstrate \u2018by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is\nlikely to fully participate in the improvement period.\u2019\u201d In re Charity H., 215 W. Va. 208, 215, 599\nS.E.2d 631, 638 (2004). However, the circuit court has discretion to deny an improvement period\nwhen no improvement is likely. See In re Tonjia M., 212 W. Va. 443, 448, 573 S.E.2d 354, 359\n(2002). Further, we have previously held that\n\n       [i]n order to remedy the abuse and/or neglect problem, the problem must first be\n       acknowledged. Failure to acknowledge the existence of the problem, i.e., the truth\n       of the basic allegation pertaining to the alleged abuse and neglect or the perpetrator\n       of said abuse and neglect, results in making the problem untreatable and in making\n       an improvement period an exercise in futility at the child\u2019s expense.\n\nIn re Timber M., 231 W. Va. 44, 55, 743 S.E.2d 352, 363 (2013) (citation omitted).\n\n                                                  5\n\f         Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, we see no error in the circuit court\u2019s determination that\npetitioner was not likely to fully participate in an improvement period. The circuit court found that\npetitioner failed to accept responsibility for engaging in domestic violence or the poor home\nconditions that led to the abuse and neglect of the children. Specifically, petitioner accused J.B. of\nfabricating the allegations and claimed the child did so because petitioner told her she was not\nallowed to date an older boy, despite ample testimony and evidence to the contrary. While\npetitioner argues that she complied with services, remained drug free, and had a bond with the\nchildren, the record establishes that this is petitioner\u2019s third CPS case and that she was provided\nimprovement periods with extensive services on two prior occasions, yet regressed to her abusive\nbehavior after the children were returned to her care. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist\ntestified that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely poor\ngiven petitioner\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility and her past participation in abuse and neglect\nproceedings without any lasting significant improvement. Further, the DHHR maintained that\nthere were no further services that could be offered to assist petitioner in improving her parenting.\nTherefore, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner an\nimprovement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights. West Virginia\nCode \u00a7 49-4-604(c)(6) provides that circuit courts are to terminate parental rights upon finding\nthat there is \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future\u201d and that termination is necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. West\nVirginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d) provides that a circuit court may find that there is no reasonable\nlikelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect can be substantially corrected when the abusing\nparent has \u201cdemonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on [his\nor her] own or with help.\u201d\n\n        The record establishes that petitioner demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the\nproblems of abuse or neglect on her own or with help. As noted above, petitioner was provided an\nimprovement period in both of her prior cases, with services such as parenting and adult life skills\nclasses and counseling. However, she reverted to her abusive behavior each time the children were\nreturned to her care. Indeed, the children were returned to petitioner in May of 2019, and the instant\npetition was filed against her less than one year later, in January of 2020. While petitioner correctly\nasserts that she complied with services and tested negative for drugs throughout the proceedings,\nshe denied the allegations of abuse, claimed J.B. was lying, and refused to accept responsibility\nfor her actions. However, the circuit court found that J.B.\u2019s disclosures of abuse were credible and\nthat petitioner\u2019s testimony to the contrary was not credible. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist\ndetermined that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely\npoor and that it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to her care. To the extent petitioner\nclaims she should have been granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the\ntermination of her parental rights, we have held that\n\n                \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights, the most drastic remedy under the\n        statutory provision covering the disposition of neglected children, [West Virginia\n        Code \u00a7 49-4-604] may be employed without the use of intervening less restrictive\n        alternatives when it is found that there is no reasonable likelihood under [West\n\n                                                   6\n\f       Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d)] that conditions of neglect or abuse can be\n       substantially corrected.\u201d Syllabus point 2, In re R.J.M., 164 W.Va. 496, 266 S.E.2d\n       114 (1980).\n\nSyl. Pt. 5, In re Kristin Y., 227 W. Va. 558, 712 S.E.2d 55 (2011). Given petitioner\u2019s failure to\nacknowledge the conditions of abuse and accept responsibility for her actions, we find that the\ncircuit court did not err in terminating her parental rights.\n\n       Lastly, because the DHHR has not yet found an adoptive placement for the children, this\nCourt reminds the circuit court of its duty to establish permanency for the children. Rule 39(b) of\nthe Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings requires:\n\n       At least once every three months until permanent placement is achieved as defined\n       in Rule 6, the court shall conduct a permanent placement review conference,\n       requiring the multidisciplinary treatment team to attend and report as to progress\n       and development in the case, for the purpose of reviewing the progress in the\n       permanent placement of the child.\n\n        Further, this Court reminds the circuit court of its duty pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of\nProcedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings to find permanent placement for the children\nwithin twelve months of the date of the dispositional order. As this Court has stated,\n\n                [t]he [twelve]-month period provided in Rule 43 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Procedure[ ] for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings for permanent placement\n       of an abused and neglected child following the final dispositional order must be\n       strictly followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances which are fully\n       substantiated in the record.\n\nCecil T., 228 W. Va. at 91, 717 S.E.2d at 875, syl. pt. 6. Moreover, this Court has stated that\n\n               [i]n determining the appropriate permanent out-of-home placement of a\n       child under [West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(6)], the circuit court shall give\n       priority to securing a suitable adoptive home for the child and shall consider other\n       placement alternatives, including permanent foster care, only where the court finds\n       that adoption would not provide custody, care, commitment, nurturing and\n       discipline consistent with the child\u2019s best interests or where a suitable adoptive\n       home [cannot] be found.\n\nSyl. Pt. 3, State v. Michael M., 202 W. Va. 350, 504 S.E.2d 177 (1998). Finally, \u201c[t]he guardian\nad litem\u2019s role in abuse and neglect proceedings does not actually cease until such time as the child\nis placed in a permanent home.\u201d Syl. Pt. 5, James M. v.

Chattin, appeals the Circuit Court of\nWebster County\u2019s March 16, 2021, order terminating her parental rights to A.B.-1, P.B., J.B., and\nA.B.-2. 1 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d), by counsel\nPatrick Morrisey and Mindy M. Parsley, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\nThe guardian ad litem (\u201cguardian\u201d), Mary Elizabeth Snead, filed a response on behalf of the\nchildren also in support of the circuit court\u2019s order. On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt erred in denying her a post-adjudicatory improvement period and terminating her parental\nrights.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        Petitioner and the children\u2019s father have a significant history of Child Protective Services\n(\u201cCPS\u201d) intervention. The DHHR filed a petition against the parents in 2013 due to their substance\nabuse, poor home conditions, and medical neglect of the children. The circuit court adjudicated\nthe parents as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement\nperiod, which they successfully completed. As such, the children were returned to the parents\u2019\ncustody. Subsequently, in 2018, the DHHR filed another petition against the parents due to\nsubstance abuse, poor home conditions, and domestic violence. The circuit court again adjudicated\nthem as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement period.\n\n       1\n         Consistent with our long-standing practice in cases with sensitive facts, we use initials\nwhere necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case. See In re K.H., 235 W. Va.\n254, 773 S.E.2d 20 (2015); Melinda H. v. William R. II, 230 W. Va. 731, 742 S.E.2d 419 (2013);\nState v. Brandon B., 218 W. Va. 324, 624 S.E.2d 761 (2005); State v. Edward Charles L., 183 W.\nVa. 641, 398 S.E.2d 123 (1990). Because two of the children share the same initials, we will refer\nto them as A.B.-1 and A.B.-2 respectively, throughout the memorandum decision.\n                                                  1\n\fThe parents also completed these improvement periods, and the children were returned to their\ncustody in May of 2019.\n\n        Only a few months later, in January of 2020, the DHHR filed the instant abuse and neglect\npetition against the parents. According to the DHHR, then fourteen-year-old J.B. disclosed to her\nschool principal that petitioner choked her and hit her with a telephone. The child further disclosed\nthat the parents were abusing drugs, that she had seen a white powdery substance and a straw on a\ncountertop in the home, and that the home smelled of marijuana. J.B. further indicated that she did\nnot feel safe in the home. Following J.B.\u2019s disclosures, a CPS worker responded to the parents\u2019\nhome and informed them of the referral concerning possible drug use. The parents were agitated\nduring the exchange and frequently went in and out of the paternal grandparents\u2019 home, which was\nnext door; they refused to allow the CPS worker or law enforcement into their own home.\nEventually, the parents agreed to submit to a drug screen at a local hospital, which was positive\nfor oxycontin. Thereafter, the CPS worker petitioned for and received a ratification for emergency\ncustody of the children, who were placed with the paternal grandparents with instructions that no\ncontact between the children and the parents was to occur.\n\n        A few days later, J.B. informed a CPS worker that on the day her parents submitted to a\ndrug screen, they called the paternal grandparents\u2019 home and requested that J.B. urinate in a cup\nand bring it to them so they would not \u201cgo to jail.\u201d J.B. indicated that the parents had previously\nasked her to urinate in a cup for them. J.B. also disclosed that the parents had been to the paternal\ngrandparents\u2019 home every day since the children had been removed from the parents\u2019 care and told\nthem not to talk to CPS. Lastly, J.B. indicated that she decided to disclose the allegations against\nthe parents because they had become increasingly aggressive with each other and had struck the\nchild P.B.\n\n        Based on this information, the DHHR alleged that the parents abused drugs, which\nnegatively affected their ability to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the children, and\nthat they failed to provide a fit and suitable home.\n\n        The circuit court held an adjudicatory hearing in May of 2020. A CPS worker testified\nregarding the allegations in the petition, including J.B.\u2019s disclosures and the worker\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation into the matter. The CPS worker testified that J.B. reported that petitioner tried to\nchoke her and that the parents abused drugs in the home. The worker further testified that the\nparents tested positive for oxycontin on the day of the removal. A CPS supervisor also testified\nregarding J.B.\u2019s disclosures stating that the child said that on the day the children were removed\nfrom the home, petitioner asked J.B. to urinate in a cup for her so that she could use J.B.\u2019s urine to\npass the drug test, and that the father had asked J.B. to do so on prior occasions.\n\n       Petitioner testified that J.B. fabricated the allegations against her and the father because\nthey would not allow her to date an older boy. Petitioner denied choking or hitting J.B. and denied\nabusing drugs, noting that the screen she submitted to on the day of the children\u2019s removal was\nnot sent for laboratory confirmation and that her hair follicle test had not shown traces of any\nsubstance. Petitioner also denied asking J.B. to urinate in a cup so that she could pass a drug screen.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Following testimony, the circuit court noted that it had watched J.B.\u2019s Child Advocacy\nCenter interview and observed that the child was very hostile and angry. It further indicated that it\nconsidered her behavior in weighing the credibility of her statements. The circuit court also noted\ninconsistencies in the parents\u2019 testimony and ultimately determined that J.B.\u2019s disclosures were\ncredible. The circuit court found that the parents accused J.B. of making up the allegations against\nthem because they allegedly angered her by telling her that her boyfriend was too old for her, but\nthere was no evidence to support such an allegation. The circuit court further found that the parents\nengaged in domestic violence in the children\u2019s presence, abused drugs, and failed to maintain a fit\nand suitable home. Accordingly, the circuit court adjudicated petitioner as an abusing parent.\n\n       Subsequently, in October of 2020, petitioner gave birth to A.B.-2, and the DHHR filed an\namended petition adding the child to the proceedings. A.B.-2 was removed from petitioner\u2019s\ncustody at that time. The circuit court adjudicated the parents as abusing parents with regard to\nA.B.-2 in November of 2020.\n\n        The circuit court held a dispositional hearing in January of 2021. The DHHR presented the\ntestimony of the parents\u2019 counselor, who testified that she provided counseling to petitioner during\na prior case and had done so throughout the instant case, addressing issues such as substance abuse,\nparenting, anxiety, and depression. The counselor opined that petitioner made some progress\nthroughout the proceedings, was cooperating during the sessions, and was motivated to change her\nbehavior. However, the counselor acknowledged that the parents had been contacting J.B. in\nviolation of the court\u2019s order, and that petitioner was urging the child to \u201ctell the truth\u201d by retracting\nher allegations of abuse. Moreover, the counselor admitted that she did \u201cnot disagree\u201d with a\npsychologist\u2019s determination that petitioner had an extremely poor prognosis of attaining\nminimally adequate parenting skills.\n\n         Next, J.B.\u2019s foster mother testified regarding contact between the child and the parents.\nThe foster mother explained that the parents were prohibited from contacting J.B. but that the child\nadmitted that she and the parents remained in contact via Facebook Messenger. J.B. disclosed that\nbefore contact with her parents was prohibited, she attended a supervised visit wherein the father\nmanaged to slip a cellphone into her bag unnoticed by the service provider. The foster mother\ntestified that she searched the child\u2019s bag, found the cellphone, and read messages sent to J.B. by\nthe parents. The foster mother stated that the parents were encouraging J.B. to change her story\nand tell the DHHR that she fabricated the allegations against the parents.\n\n        The DHHR also called the evaluating psychologist to testify regarding her evaluations of\npetitioner, J.B., and A.B.-1. Regarding J.B., the psychologist testified that she diagnosed her with\nmajor depressive disorder based on her reported history of suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well\nas problems related to sleep, worry, and self-esteem. When asked what the cause of these problems\ncould be, the psychologist stated that \u201cwhen a child . . . of her age is having those types of severe\nbehaviors, including the cutting and the suicidal ideation, and those types of things, there\u2019s always\na concern for the environment that she was in.\u201d The psychologist further opined that it would be\nbetter \u201cin the long run\u201d for J.B. to not return to the parents\u2019 care based upon the number of removals\nand the fact that the parents failed to rectify the issues leading to the children\u2019s removal over\nmultiple cases and services. Likewise, the psychologist opined that it would not be in A.B.-1\u2019s best\ninterest to be returned to the parents\u2019 care. The psychologist noted that A.B.-1 was diagnosed with\n\n                                                    3\n\fautism and cerebral palsy and required significant care. Further, A.B.-1 needed a stable, consistent\nhome environment that would provide him with the services he needed. Regarding petitioner\u2019s\nevaluation, the evaluator opined that petitioner blamed others instead of accepting responsibility\nfor her actions, which indicated that she had little motivation to make long-term changes. The\nevaluator concluded that, \u201c[g]iven [petitioner\u2019s] lack of accountability, her failure to correct the\nabuse and neglect present in the previous cases, failure to benefit from services, as well as long-\nterm substance dependence, and lack of significant periods of sobriety, . . . [petitioner\u2019s] prognosis\nfor improved parenting . . . is extremely poor.\u201d The evaluator also stated that she was not aware of\nany additional services that could be provided to petitioner to correct the circumstances of abuse.\n\n        The DHHR\u2019s next witness, a service provider, testified that she provided the parents with\nparenting classes in both the 2018 case and the instant case. The service provider stated that the\nparents were cooperative and appeared to understand the concepts of the material taught but\ncontinued to deny the allegations against them, instead blaming J.B. for the situation. The service\nprovided further stated that petitioner denied any knowledge of the father giving J.B. a cellphone\nduring a supervised visit. A CPS worker corroborated the service provider\u2019s testimony that\npetitioner was compliant with services.\n\n        Petitioner requested a post-adjudicatory improvement period. She testified that she\ncomplied with services, remained drug-free throughout the proceedings, and loved her children.\nHowever, petitioner maintained that J.B. fabricated the allegations against her. Petitioner denied\nthat she or the father provided J.B. with a cellphone during a supervised visit and claimed that the\nchild must have stolen the phone out of petitioner\u2019s car. Petitioner acknowledged that she\ncommunicated with the child in violation of the court\u2019s order but denied asking the child to change\nher story; rather, petitioner claimed she asked the child to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\n\n        Following respective counsel\u2019s arguments, the circuit court found that the children had\nbeen removed from the parents\u2019 care three times and that petitioner failed to accept responsibility\nfor her actions, consistently blaming J.B. for the proceedings. Further, the issues in the instant case\nincluded drug use and poor home conditions, which were identical to the issues in the prior two\ncases. While the parents accused J.B. of lying throughout the case, the circuit court found that such\naccusations were contrary to the evidence and further found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was \u201cless\nthan credible.\u201d Ultimately, the circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s request for an improvement period\nand terminated her parental rights upon finding that there was no reasonable likelihood that\npetitioner could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near future and that termination\nwas necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. Petitioner appeals the circuit court\u2019s March 16, 2021,\ndispositional order. 2\n\n       The Court has previously established the following standard of review in cases such as this:\n\n              \u201cAlthough conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to de\n       novo review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the\n       facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the\n\n\n       2\n        The father\u2019s parental rights were also terminated below. The permanency plan for the\nchildren is adoption.\n                                                  4\n\f       evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such\n       child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing\n       court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there\n       is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\n       with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However,\n       a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided\n       the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court\u2019s account of the\n       evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, In\n       Interest of Tiffany Marie S., 196 W.Va. 223, 470 S.E.2d 177 (1996).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, In re Cecil T., 228 W. Va. 89, 717 S.E.2d 873 (2011).\n\n         On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit court erred in terminating her parental rights\nwithout first granting her an improvement period. Petitioner acknowledges that she was\nadjudicated based upon drug abuse and domestic violence in the home but maintains that there was\nno drug abuse or domestic violence as alleged. Petitioner testified during the proceedings below\nthat J.B. fabricated the allegations because she was not permitted to date an older boy. It is\nuncontroverted that petitioner had no positive confirmed drug use during the entirety of this case\nand that she complied with all services offered, including counseling, drug screening, and\nvisitation. As such, petitioner contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in not granting\nher an improvement period prior to terminating her parental rights. Petitioner avers that there was\na reasonable likelihood that she could have corrected the conditions of abuse which led to the filing\nof the petition, as she was willing to comply with all directives of the circuit court. In looking at\nthe evidence of petitioner\u2019s compliance throughout the case, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt\u2019s findings and the termination of her parental rights was clearly erroneous and contrary to\nthe evidence.\n\n        The decision to grant or deny an improvement period rests in the sound discretion of the\ncircuit court. See In re M.M., 236 W. Va. 108, 115, 778 S.E.2d 338, 345 (2015) (\u201cWest Virginia\nlaw allows the circuit court discretion in deciding whether to grant a parent an improvement\nperiod.\u201d); Syl. Pt. 6, in part, In re Katie S., 198 W. Va. 79, 479 S.E.2d 589 (1996) (\u201cIt is within the\ncourt\u2019s discretion to grant an improvement period within the applicable statutory requirements[.]\u201d).\nWe have also held that a parent\u2019s \u201centitlement to an improvement period is conditioned upon the\nability of the [parent] to demonstrate \u2018by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is\nlikely to fully participate in the improvement period.\u2019\u201d In re Charity H., 215 W. Va. 208, 215, 599\nS.E.2d 631, 638 (2004). However, the circuit court has discretion to deny an improvement period\nwhen no improvement is likely. See In re Tonjia M., 212 W. Va. 443, 448, 573 S.E.2d 354, 359\n(2002). Further, we have previously held that\n\n       [i]n order to remedy the abuse and/or neglect problem, the problem must first be\n       acknowledged. Failure to acknowledge the existence of the problem, i.e., the truth\n       of the basic allegation pertaining to the alleged abuse and neglect or the perpetrator\n       of said abuse and neglect, results in making the problem untreatable and in making\n       an improvement period an exercise in futility at the child\u2019s expense.\n\nIn re Timber M., 231 W. Va. 44, 55, 743 S.E.2d 352, 363 (2013) (citation omitted).\n\n                                                  5\n\f         Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, we see no error in the circuit court\u2019s determination that\npetitioner was not likely to fully participate in an improvement period. The circuit court found that\npetitioner failed to accept responsibility for engaging in domestic violence or the poor home\nconditions that led to the abuse and neglect of the children. Specifically, petitioner accused J.B. of\nfabricating the allegations and claimed the child did so because petitioner told her she was not\nallowed to date an older boy, despite ample testimony and evidence to the contrary. While\npetitioner argues that she complied with services, remained drug free, and had a bond with the\nchildren, the record establishes that this is petitioner\u2019s third CPS case and that she was provided\nimprovement periods with extensive services on two prior occasions, yet regressed to her abusive\nbehavior after the children were returned to her care. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist\ntestified that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely poor\ngiven petitioner\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility and her past participation in abuse and neglect\nproceedings without any lasting significant improvement. Further, the DHHR maintained that\nthere were no further services that could be offered to assist petitioner in improving her parenting.\nTherefore, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner an\nimprovement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights. West Virginia\nCode \u00a7 49-4-604(c)(6) provides that circuit courts are to terminate parental rights upon finding\nthat there is \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future\u201d and that termination is necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. West\nVirginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d) provides that a circuit court may find that there is no reasonable\nlikelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect can be substantially corrected when the abusing\nparent has \u201cdemonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on [his\nor her] own or with help.\u201d\n\n        The record establishes that petitioner demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the\nproblems of abuse or neglect on her own or with help. As noted above, petitioner was provided an\nimprovement period in both of her prior cases, with services such as parenting and adult life skills\nclasses and counseling. However, she reverted to her abusive behavior each time the children were\nreturned to her care. Indeed, the children were returned to petitioner in May of 2019, and the instant\npetition was filed against her less than one year later, in January of 2020. While petitioner correctly\nasserts that she complied with services and tested negative for drugs throughout the proceedings,\nshe denied the allegations of abuse, claimed J.B. was lying, and refused to accept responsibility\nfor her actions. However, the circuit court found that J.B.\u2019s disclosures of abuse were credible and\nthat petitioner\u2019s testimony to the contrary was not credible. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist\ndetermined that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely\npoor and that it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to her care. To the extent petitioner\nclaims she should have been granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the\ntermination of her parental rights, we have held that\n\n                \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights, the most drastic remedy under the\n        statutory provision covering the disposition of neglected children, [West Virginia\n        Code \u00a7 49-4-604] may be employed without the use of intervening less restrictive\n        alternatives when it is found that there is no reasonable likelihood under [West\n\n                                                   6\n\f       Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d)] that conditions of neglect or abuse can be\n       substantially corrected.\u201d Syllabus point 2, In re R.J.M., 164 W.Va. 496, 266 S.E.2d\n       114 (1980).\n\nSyl. Pt. 5, In re Kristin Y., 227 W. Va. 558, 712 S.E.2d 55 (2011). Given petitioner\u2019s failure to\nacknowledge the conditions of abuse and accept responsibility for her actions, we find that the\ncircuit court did not err in terminating her parental rights.\n\n       Lastly, because the DHHR has not yet found an adoptive placement for the children, this\nCourt reminds the circuit court of its duty to establish permanency for the children. Rule 39(b) of\nthe Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings requires:\n\n       At least once every three months until permanent placement is achieved as defined\n       in Rule 6, the court shall conduct a permanent placement review conference,\n       requiring the multidisciplinary treatment team to attend and report as to progress\n       and development in the case, for the purpose of reviewing the progress in the\n       permanent placement of the child.\n\n        Further, this Court reminds the circuit court of its duty pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of\nProcedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings to find permanent placement for the children\nwithin twelve months of the date of the dispositional order. As this Court has stated,\n\n                [t]he [twelve]-month period provided in Rule 43 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Procedure[ ] for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings for permanent placement\n       of an abused and neglected child following the final dispositional order must be\n       strictly followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances which are fully\n       substantiated in the record.\n\nCecil T., 228 W. Va. at 91, 717 S.E.2d at 875, syl. pt. 6. Moreover, this Court has stated that\n\n               [i]n determining the appropriate permanent out-of-home placement of a\n       child under [West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(6)], the circuit court shall give\n       priority to securing a suitable adoptive home for the child and shall consider other\n       placement alternatives, including permanent foster care, only where the court finds\n       that adoption would not provide custody, care, commitment, nurturing and\n       discipline consistent with the child\u2019s best interests or where a suitable adoptive\n       home [cannot] be found.\n\nSyl. Pt. 3, State v. Michael M., 202 W. Va. 350, 504 S.E.2d 177 (1998). Finally, \u201c[t]he guardian\nad litem\u2019s role in abuse and neglect proceedings does not actually cease until such time as the child\nis placed in a permanent home.\u201d Syl. Pt. 5, James M. v.

Chattin, appeals the Circuit Court of\nWebster County\u2019s March 16, 2021, order terminating her parental rights to A.B.-1, P.B., J.B., and\nA.B.-2. 1 The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (\u201cDHHR\u201d), by counsel\nPatrick Morrisey and Mindy M. Parsley, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\nThe guardian ad litem (\u201cguardian\u201d), Mary Elizabeth Snead, filed a response on behalf of the\nchildren also in support of the circuit court\u2019s order. On appeal, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt erred in denying her a post-adjudicatory improvement period and terminating her parental\nrights.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        Petitioner and the children\u2019s father have a significant history of Child Protective Services\n(\u201cCPS\u201d) intervention. The DHHR filed a petition against the parents in 2013 due to their substance\nabuse, poor home conditions, and medical neglect of the children. The circuit court adjudicated\nthe parents as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement\nperiod, which they successfully completed. As such, the children were returned to the parents\u2019\ncustody. Subsequently, in 2018, the DHHR filed another petition against the parents due to\nsubstance abuse, poor home conditions, and domestic violence. The circuit court again adjudicated\nthem as abusing and neglecting parents and granted them a post-adjudicatory improvement period.\n\n       1\n         Consistent with our long-standing practice in cases with sensitive facts, we use initials\nwhere necessary to protect the identities of those involved in this case.

Because two of the children share the same initials, we will refer\nto them as A.B.-1 and A.B.-2 respectively, throughout the memorandum decision.\n                                                  1\n\fThe parents also completed these improvement periods, and the children were returned to their\ncustody in May of 2019.\n\n        Only a few months later, in January of 2020, the DHHR filed the instant abuse and neglect\npetition against the parents. According to the DHHR, then fourteen-year-old J.B. disclosed to her\nschool principal that petitioner choked her and hit her with a telephone. The child further disclosed\nthat the parents were abusing drugs, that she had seen a white powdery substance and a straw on a\ncountertop in the home, and that the home smelled of marijuana. J.B. further indicated that she did\nnot feel safe in the home. Following J.B.\u2019s disclosures, a CPS worker responded to the parents\u2019\nhome and informed them of the referral concerning possible drug use. The parents were agitated\nduring the exchange and frequently went in and out of the paternal grandparents\u2019 home, which was\nnext door; they refused to allow the CPS worker or law enforcement into their own home.\nEventually, the parents agreed to submit to a drug screen at a local hospital, which was positive\nfor oxycontin. Thereafter, the CPS worker petitioned for and received a ratification for emergency\ncustody of the children, who were placed with the paternal grandparents with instructions that no\ncontact between the children and the parents was to occur.\n\n        A few days later, J.B. informed a CPS worker that on the day her parents submitted to a\ndrug screen, they called the paternal grandparents\u2019 home and requested that J.B. urinate in a cup\nand bring it to them so they would not \u201cgo to jail.\u201d J.B. indicated that the parents had previously\nasked her to urinate in a cup for them. J.B. also disclosed that the parents had been to the paternal\ngrandparents\u2019 home every day since the children had been removed from the parents\u2019 care and told\nthem not to talk to CPS. Lastly, J.B. indicated that she decided to disclose the allegations against\nthe parents because they had become increasingly aggressive with each other and had struck the\nchild P.B.\n\n        Based on this information, the DHHR alleged that the parents abused drugs, which\nnegatively affected their ability to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the children, and\nthat they failed to provide a fit and suitable home.\n\n        The circuit court held an adjudicatory hearing in May of 2020. A CPS worker testified\nregarding the allegations in the petition, including J.B.\u2019s disclosures and the worker\u2019s subsequent\ninvestigation into the matter. The CPS worker testified that J.B. reported that petitioner tried to\nchoke her and that the parents abused drugs in the home. The worker further testified that the\nparents tested positive for oxycontin on the day of the removal. A CPS supervisor also testified\nregarding J.B.\u2019s disclosures stating that the child said that on the day the children were removed\nfrom the home, petitioner asked J.B. to urinate in a cup for her so that she could use J.B.\u2019s urine to\npass the drug test, and that the father had asked J.B. to do so on prior occasions.\n\n       Petitioner testified that J.B. fabricated the allegations against her and the father because\nthey would not allow her to date an older boy. Petitioner denied choking or hitting J.B. and denied\nabusing drugs, noting that the screen she submitted to on the day of the children\u2019s removal was\nnot sent for laboratory confirmation and that her hair follicle test had not shown traces of any\nsubstance. Petitioner also denied asking J.B. to urinate in a cup so that she could pass a drug screen.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Following testimony, the circuit court noted that it had watched J.B.\u2019s Child Advocacy\nCenter interview and observed that the child was very hostile and angry. It further indicated that it\nconsidered her behavior in weighing the credibility of her statements. The circuit court also noted\ninconsistencies in the parents\u2019 testimony and ultimately determined that J.B.\u2019s disclosures were\ncredible. The circuit court found that the parents accused J.B. of making up the allegations against\nthem because they allegedly angered her by telling her that her boyfriend was too old for her, but\nthere was no evidence to support such an allegation. The circuit court further found that the parents\nengaged in domestic violence in the children\u2019s presence, abused drugs, and failed to maintain a fit\nand suitable home. Accordingly, the circuit court adjudicated petitioner as an abusing parent.\n\n       Subsequently, in October of 2020, petitioner gave birth to A.B.-2, and the DHHR filed an\namended petition adding the child to the proceedings. A.B.-2 was removed from petitioner\u2019s\ncustody at that time. The circuit court adjudicated the parents as abusing parents with regard to\nA.B.-2 in November of 2020.\n\n        The circuit court held a dispositional hearing in January of 2021. The DHHR presented the\ntestimony of the parents\u2019 counselor, who testified that she provided counseling to petitioner during\na prior case and had done so throughout the instant case, addressing issues such as substance abuse,\nparenting, anxiety, and depression. The counselor opined that petitioner made some progress\nthroughout the proceedings, was cooperating during the sessions, and was motivated to change her\nbehavior. However, the counselor acknowledged that the parents had been contacting J.B. in\nviolation of the court\u2019s order, and that petitioner was urging the child to \u201ctell the truth\u201d by retracting\nher allegations of abuse. Moreover, the counselor admitted that she did \u201cnot disagree\u201d with a\npsychologist\u2019s determination that petitioner had an extremely poor prognosis of attaining\nminimally adequate parenting skills.\n\n         Next, J.B.\u2019s foster mother testified regarding contact between the child and the parents.\nThe foster mother explained that the parents were prohibited from contacting J.B. but that the child\nadmitted that she and the parents remained in contact via Facebook Messenger. J.B. disclosed that\nbefore contact with her parents was prohibited, she attended a supervised visit wherein the father\nmanaged to slip a cellphone into her bag unnoticed by the service provider. The foster mother\ntestified that she searched the child\u2019s bag, found the cellphone, and read messages sent to J.B. by\nthe parents. The foster mother stated that the parents were encouraging J.B. to change her story\nand tell the DHHR that she fabricated the allegations against the parents.\n\n        The DHHR also called the evaluating psychologist to testify regarding her evaluations of\npetitioner, J.B., and A.B.-1. Regarding J.B., the psychologist testified that she diagnosed her with\nmajor depressive disorder based on her reported history of suicidal ideation and self-harm, as well\nas problems related to sleep, worry, and self-esteem. When asked what the cause of these problems\ncould be, the psychologist stated that \u201cwhen a child . . . of her age is having those types of severe\nbehaviors, including the cutting and the suicidal ideation, and those types of things, there\u2019s always\na concern for the environment that she was in.\u201d The psychologist further opined that it would be\nbetter \u201cin the long run\u201d for J.B. to not return to the parents\u2019 care based upon the number of removals\nand the fact that the parents failed to rectify the issues leading to the children\u2019s removal over\nmultiple cases and services. Likewise, the psychologist opined that it would not be in A.B.-1\u2019s best\ninterest to be returned to the parents\u2019 care. The psychologist noted that A.B.-1 was diagnosed with\n\n                                                    3\n\fautism and cerebral palsy and required significant care. Further, A.B.-1 needed a stable, consistent\nhome environment that would provide him with the services he needed. Regarding petitioner\u2019s\nevaluation, the evaluator opined that petitioner blamed others instead of accepting responsibility\nfor her actions, which indicated that she had little motivation to make long-term changes. The\nevaluator concluded that, \u201c[g]iven [petitioner\u2019s] lack of accountability, her failure to correct the\nabuse and neglect present in the previous cases, failure to benefit from services, as well as long-\nterm substance dependence, and lack of significant periods of sobriety, . . . [petitioner\u2019s] prognosis\nfor improved parenting . . . is extremely poor.\u201d The evaluator also stated that she was not aware of\nany additional services that could be provided to petitioner to correct the circumstances of abuse.\n\n        The DHHR\u2019s next witness, a service provider, testified that she provided the parents with\nparenting classes in both the 2018 case and the instant case. The service provider stated that the\nparents were cooperative and appeared to understand the concepts of the material taught but\ncontinued to deny the allegations against them, instead blaming J.B. for the situation. The service\nprovided further stated that petitioner denied any knowledge of the father giving J.B. a cellphone\nduring a supervised visit. A CPS worker corroborated the service provider\u2019s testimony that\npetitioner was compliant with services.\n\n        Petitioner requested a post-adjudicatory improvement period. She testified that she\ncomplied with services, remained drug-free throughout the proceedings, and loved her children.\nHowever, petitioner maintained that J.B. fabricated the allegations against her. Petitioner denied\nthat she or the father provided J.B. with a cellphone during a supervised visit and claimed that the\nchild must have stolen the phone out of petitioner\u2019s car. Petitioner acknowledged that she\ncommunicated with the child in violation of the court\u2019s order but denied asking the child to change\nher story; rather, petitioner claimed she asked the child to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d\n\n        Following respective counsel\u2019s arguments, the circuit court found that the children had\nbeen removed from the parents\u2019 care three times and that petitioner failed to accept responsibility\nfor her actions, consistently blaming J.B. for the proceedings. Further, the issues in the instant case\nincluded drug use and poor home conditions, which were identical to the issues in the prior two\ncases. While the parents accused J.B. of lying throughout the case, the circuit court found that such\naccusations were contrary to the evidence and further found that petitioner\u2019s testimony was \u201cless\nthan credible.\u201d Ultimately, the circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s request for an improvement period\nand terminated her parental rights upon finding that there was no reasonable likelihood that\npetitioner could correct the conditions of abuse and neglect in the near future and that termination\nwas necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. Petitioner appeals the circuit court\u2019s March 16, 2021,\ndispositional order. 2\n\n       The Court has previously established the following standard of review in cases such as this:\n\n              \u201cAlthough conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to de\n       novo review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the\n       facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the\n\n\n       2\n        The father\u2019s parental rights were also terminated below. The permanency plan for the\nchildren is adoption.\n                                                  4\n\f       evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such\n       child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing\n       court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there\n       is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left\n       with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However,\n       a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided\n       the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court\u2019s account of the\n       evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d Syl.

Petitioner acknowledges that she was\nadjudicated based upon drug abuse and domestic violence in the home but maintains that there was\nno drug abuse or domestic violence as alleged. Petitioner testified during the proceedings below\nthat J.B. fabricated the allegations because she was not permitted to date an older boy. It is\nuncontroverted that petitioner had no positive confirmed drug use during the entirety of this case\nand that she complied with all services offered, including counseling, drug screening, and\nvisitation. As such, petitioner contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in not granting\nher an improvement period prior to terminating her parental rights. Petitioner avers that there was\na reasonable likelihood that she could have corrected the conditions of abuse which led to the filing\nof the petition, as she was willing to comply with all directives of the circuit court. In looking at\nthe evidence of petitioner\u2019s compliance throughout the case, petitioner argues that the circuit\ncourt\u2019s findings and the termination of her parental rights was clearly erroneous and contrary to\nthe evidence.\n\n        The decision to grant or deny an improvement period rests in the sound discretion of the\ncircuit court.

The circuit court found that\npetitioner failed to accept responsibility for engaging in domestic violence or the poor home\nconditions that led to the abuse and neglect of the children. Specifically, petitioner accused J.B. of\nfabricating the allegations and claimed the child did so because petitioner told her she was not\nallowed to date an older boy, despite ample testimony and evidence to the contrary. While\npetitioner argues that she complied with services, remained drug free, and had a bond with the\nchildren, the record establishes that this is petitioner\u2019s third CPS case and that she was provided\nimprovement periods with extensive services on two prior occasions, yet regressed to her abusive\nbehavior after the children were returned to her care. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist\ntestified that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely poor\ngiven petitioner\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility and her past participation in abuse and neglect\nproceedings without any lasting significant improvement. Further, the DHHR maintained that\nthere were no further services that could be offered to assist petitioner in improving her parenting.\nTherefore, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner an\nimprovement period.\n\n        We likewise find no error in the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights. West Virginia\nCode \u00a7 49-4-604(c)(6) provides that circuit courts are to terminate parental rights upon finding\nthat there is \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the conditions of neglect or abuse can be substantially\ncorrected in the near future\u201d and that termination is necessary for the children\u2019s welfare. West\nVirginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d) provides that a circuit court may find that there is no reasonable\nlikelihood that the conditions of abuse and neglect can be substantially corrected when the abusing\nparent has \u201cdemonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the problems of abuse or neglect on [his\nor her] own or with help.\u201d\n\n        The record establishes that petitioner demonstrated an inadequate capacity to solve the\nproblems of abuse or neglect on her own or with help. As noted above, petitioner was provided an\nimprovement period in both of her prior cases, with services such as parenting and adult life skills\nclasses and counseling. However, she reverted to her abusive behavior each time the children were\nreturned to her care. Indeed, the children were returned to petitioner in May of 2019, and the instant\npetition was filed against her less than one year later, in January of 2020. While petitioner correctly\nasserts that she complied with services and tested negative for drugs throughout the proceedings,\nshe denied the allegations of abuse, claimed J.B. was lying, and refused to accept responsibility\nfor her actions. However, the circuit court found that J.B.\u2019s disclosures of abuse were credible and\nthat petitioner\u2019s testimony to the contrary was not credible. Moreover, the evaluating psychologist\ndetermined that petitioner\u2019s prognosis for attaining minimally adequate parenting was extremely\npoor and that it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to her care. To the extent petitioner\nclaims she should have been granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period prior to the\ntermination of her parental rights, we have held that\n\n                \u201c[t]ermination of parental rights, the most drastic remedy under the\n        statutory provision covering the disposition of neglected children, [West Virginia\n        Code \u00a7 49-4-604] may be employed without the use of intervening less restrictive\n        alternatives when it is found that there is no reasonable likelihood under [West\n\n                                                   6\n\f       Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(d)] that conditions of neglect or abuse can be\n       substantially corrected.\u201d Syllabus point 2, In re R.J.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 W.Va. 496</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265798\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265798/in-re-rjm/\">266 S.E.2d\n       114</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980).\n\nSyl.

Given petitioner\u2019s failure to\nacknowledge the conditions of abuse and accept responsibility for her actions, we find that the\ncircuit court did not err in terminating her parental rights.\n\n       Lastly, because the DHHR has not yet found an adoptive placement for the children, this\nCourt reminds the circuit court of its duty to establish permanency for the children. Rule 39(b) of\nthe Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings requires:\n\n       At least once every three months until permanent placement is achieved as defined\n       in Rule 6, the court shall conduct a permanent placement review conference,\n       requiring the multidisciplinary treatment team to attend and report as to progress\n       and development in the case, for the purpose of reviewing the progress in the\n       permanent placement of the child.\n\n        Further, this Court reminds the circuit court of its duty pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of\nProcedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings to find permanent placement for the children\nwithin twelve months of the date of the dispositional order. As this Court has stated,\n\n                [t]he [twelve]-month period provided in Rule 43 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Procedure[ ] for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings for permanent placement\n       of an abused and neglected child following the final dispositional order must be\n       strictly followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances which are fully\n       substantiated in the record.\n\nCecil T., 228 W.
