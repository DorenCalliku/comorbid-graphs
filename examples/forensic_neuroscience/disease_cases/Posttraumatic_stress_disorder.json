He has a high school\n   education and some college. Webster served in Iraq where he witnessed\n   several traumatic events, including the death of a friend and the\n   endangerment of Iraqi children. He suffered from posttraumatic stress\n   disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) following these events and was admitted into a PTSD\n   Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program for over a month in 2016. He\n   also complains of numerous physical impairments including knee, foot, and\n   back pain.\n          On March 19, 2019, Webster applied for Title II Social Security\n   disability insurance benefits, alleging physical and mental impairments that\n   began in March of 2016. Webster was 43 years old at the time of the alleged\n   onset of his disability and 46 years old at the time of his hearing. Webster\u2019s\n   application for benefits was denied initially and upon reconsideration.\n   Thereafter, Webster requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge\n   (\u201cALJ\u201d).      Though he found that Webster suffered from various\n   impairments, the ALJ denied benefits on the grounds that none of the\n   impairments met or exceeded the severity of the listing requirements under\n   the applicable regulations. Additionally, the ALJ found that Webster could\n   perform relevant past work as an assembler or perform various light effort,\n   limited contact jobs suggested by a vocational expert.\n          Webster timely appealed the denial to the district court. The parties\n   consented to a hearing before a magistrate judge, and that judge affirmed the\n   ALJ\u2019s decision. Webster timely appealed.\n                                  DISCUSSION\n          This court reviews a Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security\n   disability benefits \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) the final decision is\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588          Page: 3   Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 20-60856\n\n\n   supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used\n   the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence.\u201d Keel v. Saul, 986 F.3d\n   551, 555 (5th Cir. 2021) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Substantial\n   evidence is merely enough that a reasonable mind could arrive at the same\n   decision; though the evidence \u201cmust be more than a scintilla[,] it need not\n   be a preponderance.\u201d Taylor v. Astrue, 706 F.3d 600, 602 (5th Cir. 2012)\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n          To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner\u2019s\n   analysis proceeds along five steps. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The\n   Commissioner considers (1) whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial\n   gainful activity,\u201d (2) the severity and duration of the claimant\u2019s impairments,\n   (3) whether the claimant\u2019s impairment \u201cmeets or equals\u201d one of the listings\n   in the relevant regulations, (4) whether the claimant can still do his \u201cpast\n   relevant work,\u201d and (5) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from\n   doing any relevant work. Id. The claimant bears the burden on the first four\n   steps. See Keel, 986 F.3d at 555. If the claimant advances that far, the burden\n   shifts to the Commissioner to \u201cprove the claimant\u2019s employability.\u201d Id.\n          On appeal, Webster argues that the ALJ erred for several reasons\n   relating loosely to Steps 3 through 5 of the sequential evaluation process.\n   These arguments can be reduced to three categories: (1) disputes about the\n   validity of the Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d); (2) arguments that a\n   Consultative Exam should have been ordered; and (3) arguments raised for\n   the first time on appeal regarding the listing impairments and Webster\u2019s\n   ability to maintain work. We consider the arguments in that order.\n   I.     The RFC was supported by substantial evidence.\n          First, Webster argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC was not supported by\n   substantial evidence because the ALJ failed to incorporate allegedly more\n   restrictive portions of a state agency report prepared by Dr. Angela Herzgog\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fCase: 20-60856     Document: 00516109588           Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 20-60856\n\n\n   and failed to accord proper weight to Webster\u2019s examiner, Dr. Charles Small.\n   Webster argues further that the allegedly faulty RFC corrupted the ALJ\u2019s\n   hypothetical questioning of the vocational expert.\n          An \u201cALJ is responsible for determining an applicant\u2019s residual\n   functional capacity.\u201d Ripley v. Chater, 67 F.3d 552, 557 (5th Cir. 1995). In\n   doing so, an ALJ examines the medical evidence in the record, including the\n   testimony of physicians and the claimant\u2019s medical records. See id. An ALJ\n   usually cannot reject a medical opinion without some explanation. See\n   Kneeland v. Berryhill, 850 F.3d 749, 760 (5th Cir. 2017).\n          Notably, though, ALJs are no longer required to give controlling\n   weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion, as was mandated by federal\n   regulations and our caselaw in the past. Compare 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   (2016), with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c; see also 82 Fed. Reg. 5853 (Jan. 18, 2017)\n   (commenting that the rule change would enable courts to focus on \u201cthe\n   content of the evidence [rather] than on the source.\u201d). For claims filed after\n   March 27, 2017, an ALJ instead considers a list of factors in determining what\n   weight, if any, to give a medical opinion. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c. The most\n   important factors in determining the persuasiveness of a medical source are\n   whether the source\u2019s medical opinion is based on \u201cobjective medical\n   evidence and supporting explanations\u201d and the \u201cconsistency\u201d of the\n   source\u2019s opinion with the evidence from other medical and nonmedical\n   sources in the claim. Id.\n          The ALJ in these proceedings relied on the state agency\u2019s 2018\n   assessment, finding it \u201cpersuasive\u201d because it was supported by the evidence\n   and consistent with Webster\u2019s other records. The state agency found that\n   Webster had the capacity to maintain attention and concentration \u201cfor two\n   hour periods . . . without excessive interruption from psychological\n   symptoms\u201d and could \u201cinteract adequately, on a limited basis, receive non-\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588         Page: 5    Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 20-60856\n\n\n   confrontational supervision, and make mental adaptions to complete\n   unskilled tasks in a work setting, especially those requiring minimal\n   interaction with others.\u201d Further, Webster \u201cretain[ed] mental capacity to\n   complete unskilled work tasks for which he remains physically capable.\u201d\n          Contrary to Webster\u2019s contentions, the ALJ incorporated these\n   findings into Webster\u2019s RFC, which stated that Webster had the \u201cresidual\n   functional capacity to perform light work as defined by 20 C.F.R.\n   [\u00a7] 404.1567(b) except that he can engage in occasional climbing and\n   balancing\u201d and that he was \u201cfurther limited to routine, repetitive tasks with\n   occasional public contact.\u201d Furthermore, the ALJ appropriately used the\n   RFC when questioning the vocational expert, and Webster\u2019s counsel had\n   \u201cthe opportunity to correct deficiencies in the ALJ\u2019s question by mentioning\n   or suggesting to the vocational expert any purported defects in the\n   hypothetical questions.\u201d Bowling v. Shalala, 36 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir. 1994).\n   Moreover, the RFC and the state agency report are reflected in the vocational\n   expert\u2019s proposed occupations, as he specifically identified potential\n   employment that did not require \u201ca great deal of interaction with the public\n   or coworkers.\u201d\n          The ALJ also articulated his reasons for rejecting the testimony of Dr.\n   Small. As is required by Section 404.1520c, the ALJ considered both the\n   consistency and supportability of Dr. Small\u2019s testimony in light of other\n   medical opinions and evidence in the record, including Webster\u2019s hospital\n   and VA treatment records. Ultimately, the ALJ determined that Dr. Small\u2019s\n   testimony was only \u201csupported\u201d by his own findings and was inconsistent\n   with Webster\u2019s medical history and longitudinal psychiatric treatment\n   records indicating improvement to the symptoms caused by Webster\u2019s\n   PTSD. Though the ALJ neither adopted the state agency report verbatim\n   nor accepted the testimony of Dr. Small, it cannot be said that his decision\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fCase: 20-60856        Document: 00516109588              Page: 6      Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 20-60856\n\n\n   was not based on substantial evidence or that he improperly applied the\n   relevant legal standards.\n   II.     A Consultative Exam was not required.\n           Webster also argues that the ALJ erred by failing to order a requested\n   Consultative Exam (\u201cCE\u201d). Webster argues that the conflicting evidence\n   introduced by Dr. Small necessitated a further development of the record\n   with a government-funded CE.1\n           An \u201cALJ has a duty to develop the facts fully and fairly relating to an\n   applicant\u2019s claim for disability benefits.\u201d Ripley, 67 F.3d at 557. An ALJ\u2019s\n   failure to fulfill this duty is not reversible error unless the claimant is\n   prejudiced. Id. \u201cA consultative examination is required to develop a \u2018full\n   and fair record\u2019 only if \u2018the record establishes that such an examination is\n   necessary to enable the [ALJ] to make the disability decision.\u2019\u201d Hardman v.\n   Colvin, 820 F.3d 142, 148 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Jones v. Bowen, 829 F.2d\n   524, 526 (5th Cir. 1987)).\n           As in Hardman, the record here is \u201creplete with medical documents\n   that spanned years.\u201d Id. The ALJ reviewed Webster\u2019s medical records from\n   both the Veteran\u2019s Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) and the hospital, the state agency\n   consultation, the findings of Dr. Small, and testimony from Webster\u2019s wife\n   and mother. Nothing in the record suggests that the ALJ needed any more\n   medical information to reach an informed decision about whether Webster\n   was disabled. The ALJ\u2019s decision was based upon substantial evidence in a\n   sufficiently developed record, and he did not err in declining to order the CE.\n\n\n\n           1\n            Part of Webster\u2019s argument for a CE relies on his belief that the ALJ erred in\n   determining that the record showed no evidence of prescribed knee and back braces.\n   Though the record does evidence the existence of the knee brace, the pages cited by Webster\n   do not demonstrate that either the back or knee brace were prescribed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588          Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 20-60856\n\n\n   III.   Webster\u2019s remaining arguments were waived.\n          Webster advances two final claims of error that he did not raise at the\n   district court. First, he argues that the ALJ erred by not analyzing Listing\n   Impairment 12.15 for Trauma and Stressor related disorders. Second, he\n   argues that the ALJ erred by failing to determine whether Webster could hold\n   whatever job he could find for a significant period of time.\n          Our court adheres to the general rule that \u201carguments not raised\n   before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on\n   appeal.\u201d LeMaire v. Louisiana Dep\u2019t of Transp. & Dev., 480 F.3d 383, 387\n   (5th Cir. 2007). An argument is not waived, though, \u201cif the argument on the\n   issue before the district court was sufficient to permit the district court to\n   rule on it.\u201d Horton v. Bank One, N.A., 387 F.3d 426, 435 (5th Cir. 2004)\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n          Webster did not raise these arguments at the district court or present\n   them in a manner sufficient for the district court to rule on them. Nor did he\n   respond to the Commissioner\u2019s arguments that they were waived.\n   Consequently, we hold that Webster waived these arguments.\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f", "node": {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/5129951/", "id": 5129951, "absolute_url": "/opinion/5301389/webster-v-kijakazi/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/5301389/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2021-11-29T17:00:38.121124-08:00", "date_modified": "2021-11-29T17:31:00.206725-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "321544c55696624fe21d9e0908d02db6853f77ba", "page_count": 7, "download_url": "http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/20/20-60856-CV0.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2021/11/29/webster_v._kijakazi.pdf", "plain_text": "Case: 20-60856     Document: 00516109588         Page: 1     Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n           United States Court of Appeals\n                for the Fifth Circuit                                    United States Court of Appeals\n                                                                                  Fifth Circuit\n\n                                                                                FILED\n                                  No. 20-60856                           November 29, 2021\n                                                                           Lyle W.

We consider the arguments in that order.\n   I.     The RFC was supported by substantial evidence.\n          First, Webster argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC was not supported by\n   substantial evidence because the ALJ failed to incorporate allegedly more\n   restrictive portions of a state agency report prepared by Dr. Angela Herzgog\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fCase: 20-60856     Document: 00516109588           Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 20-60856\n\n\n   and failed to accord proper weight to Webster\u2019s examiner, Dr. Charles Small.\n   Webster argues further that the allegedly faulty RFC corrupted the ALJ\u2019s\n   hypothetical questioning of the vocational expert.\n          An \u201cALJ is responsible for determining an applicant\u2019s residual\n   functional capacity.\u201d Ripley v. Chater, 67 F.3d 552, 557 (5th Cir. 1995). In\n   doing so, an ALJ examines the medical evidence in the record, including the\n   testimony of physicians and the claimant\u2019s medical records. See id. An ALJ\n   usually cannot reject a medical opinion without some explanation. See\n   Kneeland v. Berryhill, 850 F.3d 749, 760 (5th Cir. 2017).\n          Notably, though, ALJs are no longer required to give controlling\n   weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion, as was mandated by federal\n   regulations and our caselaw in the past. Compare 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   (2016), with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c; see also 82 Fed. Reg. 5853 (Jan. 18, 2017)\n   (commenting that the rule change would enable courts to focus on \u201cthe\n   content of the evidence [rather] than on the source.\u201d). For claims filed after\n   March 27, 2017, an ALJ instead considers a list of factors in determining what\n   weight, if any, to give a medical opinion. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c. The most\n   important factors in determining the persuasiveness of a medical source are\n   whether the source\u2019s medical opinion is based on \u201cobjective medical\n   evidence and supporting explanations\u201d and the \u201cconsistency\u201d of the\n   source\u2019s opinion with the evidence from other medical and nonmedical\n   sources in the claim. Id.\n          The ALJ in these proceedings relied on the state agency\u2019s 2018\n   assessment, finding it \u201cpersuasive\u201d because it was supported by the evidence\n   and consistent with Webster\u2019s other records. The state agency found that\n   Webster had the capacity to maintain attention and concentration \u201cfor two\n   hour periods . . . without excessive interruption from psychological\n   symptoms\u201d and could \u201cinteract adequately, on a limited basis, receive non-\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588         Page: 5    Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 20-60856\n\n\n   confrontational supervision, and make mental adaptions to complete\n   unskilled tasks in a work setting, especially those requiring minimal\n   interaction with others.\u201d Further, Webster \u201cretain[ed] mental capacity to\n   complete unskilled work tasks for which he remains physically capable.\u201d\n          Contrary to Webster\u2019s contentions, the ALJ incorporated these\n   findings into Webster\u2019s RFC, which stated that Webster had the \u201cresidual\n   functional capacity to perform light work as defined by 20 C.F.R.\n   [\u00a7] 404.1567(b) except that he can engage in occasional climbing and\n   balancing\u201d and that he was \u201cfurther limited to routine, repetitive tasks with\n   occasional public contact.\u201d Furthermore, the ALJ appropriately used the\n   RFC when questioning the vocational expert, and Webster\u2019s counsel had\n   \u201cthe opportunity to correct deficiencies in the ALJ\u2019s question by mentioning\n   or suggesting to the vocational expert any purported defects in the\n   hypothetical questions.\u201d Bowling v. Shalala, 36 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir. 1994).\n   Moreover, the RFC and the state agency report are reflected in the vocational\n   expert\u2019s proposed occupations, as he specifically identified potential\n   employment that did not require \u201ca great deal of interaction with the public\n   or coworkers.\u201d\n          The ALJ also articulated his reasons for rejecting the testimony of Dr.\n   Small. As is required by Section 404.1520c, the ALJ considered both the\n   consistency and supportability of Dr. Small\u2019s testimony in light of other\n   medical opinions and evidence in the record, including Webster\u2019s hospital\n   and VA treatment records. Ultimately, the ALJ determined that Dr. Small\u2019s\n   testimony was only \u201csupported\u201d by his own findings and was inconsistent\n   with Webster\u2019s medical history and longitudinal psychiatric treatment\n   records indicating improvement to the symptoms caused by Webster\u2019s\n   PTSD. Though the ALJ neither adopted the state agency report verbatim\n   nor accepted the testimony of Dr. Small, it cannot be said that his decision\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fCase: 20-60856        Document: 00516109588              Page: 6      Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 20-60856\n\n\n   was not based on substantial evidence or that he improperly applied the\n   relevant legal standards.\n   II.     A Consultative Exam was not required.\n           Webster also argues that the ALJ erred by failing to order a requested\n   Consultative Exam (\u201cCE\u201d). Webster argues that the conflicting evidence\n   introduced by Dr. Small necessitated a further development of the record\n   with a government-funded CE.1\n           An \u201cALJ has a duty to develop the facts fully and fairly relating to an\n   applicant\u2019s claim for disability benefits.\u201d Ripley, 67 F.3d at 557. An ALJ\u2019s\n   failure to fulfill this duty is not reversible error unless the claimant is\n   prejudiced. Id. \u201cA consultative examination is required to develop a \u2018full\n   and fair record\u2019 only if \u2018the record establishes that such an examination is\n   necessary to enable the [ALJ] to make the disability decision.\u2019\u201d Hardman v.\n   Colvin, 820 F.3d 142, 148 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Jones v. Bowen, 829 F.2d\n   524, 526 (5th Cir. 1987)).\n           As in Hardman, the record here is \u201creplete with medical documents\n   that spanned years.\u201d Id. The ALJ reviewed Webster\u2019s medical records from\n   both the Veteran\u2019s Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) and the hospital, the state agency\n   consultation, the findings of Dr. Small, and testimony from Webster\u2019s wife\n   and mother. Nothing in the record suggests that the ALJ needed any more\n   medical information to reach an informed decision about whether Webster\n   was disabled. The ALJ\u2019s decision was based upon substantial evidence in a\n   sufficiently developed record, and he did not err in declining to order the CE.\n\n\n\n           1\n            Part of Webster\u2019s argument for a CE relies on his belief that the ALJ erred in\n   determining that the record showed no evidence of prescribed knee and back braces.\n   Though the record does evidence the existence of the knee brace, the pages cited by Webster\n   do not demonstrate that either the back or knee brace were prescribed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588          Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 20-60856\n\n\n   III.   Webster\u2019s remaining arguments were waived.\n          Webster advances two final claims of error that he did not raise at the\n   district court. First, he argues that the ALJ erred by not analyzing Listing\n   Impairment 12.15 for Trauma and Stressor related disorders. Second, he\n   argues that the ALJ erred by failing to determine whether Webster could hold\n   whatever job he could find for a significant period of time.\n          Our court adheres to the general rule that \u201carguments not raised\n   before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on\n   appeal.\u201d LeMaire v. Louisiana Dep\u2019t of Transp. & Dev., 480 F.3d 383, 387\n   (5th Cir. 2007). An argument is not waived, though, \u201cif the argument on the\n   issue before the district court was sufficient to permit the district court to\n   rule on it.\u201d Horton v. Bank One, N.A., 387 F.3d 426, 435 (5th Cir. 2004)\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n          Webster did not raise these arguments at the district court or present\n   them in a manner sufficient for the district court to rule on them. Nor did he\n   respond to the Commissioner\u2019s arguments that they were waived.\n   Consequently, we hold that Webster waived these arguments.\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">Case: 20-60856     Document: 00516109588         Page: 1     Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n           United States Court of Appeals\n                for the Fifth Circuit                                    United States Court of Appeals\n                                                                                  Fifth Circuit\n\n                                                                                FILED\n                                  No. 20-60856                           November 29, 2021\n                                                                           Lyle W.

Southwick, Circuit Judge:\n          The district court affirmed the decision of the Social Security\n   Commissioner to deny disability benefits to Arthur Webster. On appeal,\n   Webster argues that the Administrative Law Judge erred in assessing his\n   Residual Function Capacity and failed to develop the record by declining to\n   order a Consultative Exam.

He has a high school\n   education and some college. Webster served in Iraq where he witnessed\n   several traumatic events, including the death of a friend and the\n   endangerment of Iraqi children. He suffered from posttraumatic stress\n   disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) following these events and was admitted into a PTSD\n   Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program for over a month in 2016. He\n   also complains of numerous physical impairments including knee, foot, and\n   back pain.\n          On March 19, 2019, Webster applied for Title II Social Security\n   disability insurance benefits, alleging physical and mental impairments that\n   began in March of 2016. Webster was 43 years old at the time of the alleged\n   onset of his disability and 46 years old at the time of his hearing. Webster\u2019s\n   application for benefits was denied initially and upon reconsideration.\n   Thereafter, Webster requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge\n   (\u201cALJ\u201d).      Though he found that Webster suffered from various\n   impairments, the ALJ denied benefits on the grounds that none of the\n   impairments met or exceeded the severity of the listing requirements under\n   the applicable regulations. Additionally, the ALJ found that Webster could\n   perform relevant past work as an assembler or perform various light effort,\n   limited contact jobs suggested by a vocational expert.\n          Webster timely appealed the denial to the district court.

Id.\n          The ALJ in these proceedings relied on the state agency\u2019s 2018\n   assessment, finding it \u201cpersuasive\u201d because it was supported by the evidence\n   and consistent with Webster\u2019s other records. The state agency found that\n   Webster had the capacity to maintain attention and concentration \u201cfor two\n   hour periods . . . without excessive interruption from psychological\n   symptoms\u201d and could \u201cinteract adequately, on a limited basis, receive non-\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588         Page: 5    Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 20-60856\n\n\n   confrontational supervision, and make mental adaptions to complete\n   unskilled tasks in a work setting, especially those requiring minimal\n   interaction with others.\u201d Further, Webster \u201cretain[ed] mental capacity to\n   complete unskilled work tasks for which he remains physically capable.\u201d\n          Contrary to Webster\u2019s contentions, the ALJ incorporated these\n   findings into Webster\u2019s RFC, which stated that Webster had the \u201cresidual\n   functional capacity to perform light work as defined by 20 C.F.R.\n   [\u00a7] 404.1567(b) except that he can engage in occasional climbing and\n   balancing\u201d and that he was \u201cfurther limited to routine, repetitive tasks with\n   occasional public contact.\u201d Furthermore, the ALJ appropriately used the\n   RFC when questioning the vocational expert, and Webster\u2019s counsel had\n   \u201cthe opportunity to correct deficiencies in the ALJ\u2019s question by mentioning\n   or suggesting to the vocational expert any purported defects in the\n   hypothetical questions.\u201d Bowling v. Shalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678830\"><a href=\"/opinion/678830/45-socsecrepser-610-unemplinsrep-cch-p-14254b-elbert-l-bowling/\">36 F.3d 431</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (5th Cir. 1994).\n   Moreover, the RFC and the state agency report are reflected in the vocational\n   expert\u2019s proposed occupations, as he specifically identified potential\n   employment that did not require \u201ca great deal of interaction with the public\n   or coworkers.\u201d\n          The ALJ also articulated his reasons for rejecting the testimony of Dr.\n   Small. As is required by Section 404.1520c, the ALJ considered both the\n   consistency and supportability of Dr. Small\u2019s testimony in light of other\n   medical opinions and evidence in the record, including Webster\u2019s hospital\n   and VA treatment records. Ultimately, the ALJ determined that Dr. Small\u2019s\n   testimony was only \u201csupported\u201d by his own findings and was inconsistent\n   with Webster\u2019s medical history and longitudinal psychiatric treatment\n   records indicating improvement to the symptoms caused by Webster\u2019s\n   PTSD. Though the ALJ neither adopted the state agency report verbatim\n   nor accepted the testimony of Dr. Small, it cannot be said that his decision\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fCase: 20-60856        Document: 00516109588              Page: 6      Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 20-60856\n\n\n   was not based on substantial evidence or that he improperly applied the\n   relevant legal standards.\n   II.     A Consultative Exam was not required.\n           Webster also argues that the ALJ erred by failing to order a requested\n   Consultative Exam (\u201cCE\u201d). Webster argues that the conflicting evidence\n   introduced by Dr. Small necessitated a further development of the record\n   with a government-funded CE.1\n           An \u201cALJ has a duty to develop the facts fully and fairly relating to an\n   applicant\u2019s claim for disability benefits.\u201d Ripley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705923\"><a href=\"/opinion/705923/49-socsecrepser-112-unemplinsrep-cch-p-14847b-travis-ripley-v/\">67 F.3d at 557</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Nothing in the record suggests that the ALJ needed any more\n   medical information to reach an informed decision about whether Webster\n   was disabled. The ALJ\u2019s decision was based upon substantial evidence in a\n   sufficiently developed record, and he did not err in declining to order the CE.\n\n\n\n           1\n            Part of Webster\u2019s argument for a CE relies on his belief that the ALJ erred in\n   determining that the record showed no evidence of prescribed knee and back braces.\n   Though the record does evidence the existence of the knee brace, the pages cited by Webster\n   do not demonstrate that either the back or knee brace were prescribed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fCase: 20-60856      Document: 00516109588          Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/29/2021\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 20-60856\n\n\n   III.   Webster\u2019s remaining arguments were waived.\n          Webster advances two final claims of error that he did not raise at the\n   district court. First, he argues that the ALJ erred by not analyzing Listing\n   Impairment 12.15 for Trauma and Stressor related disorders. Second, he\n   argues that the ALJ erred by failing to determine whether Webster could hold\n   whatever job he could find for a significant period of time.\n          Our court adheres to the general rule that \u201carguments not raised\n   before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on\n   appeal.\u201d LeMaire v.

Officers found Jo.M. had been left alone with Mother's cousin, who had overdosed\n\nwhile Jo.M. was present. Officers found drugs, needles, and other drug paraphernalia\n\nwithin reach of the children, including in Mother's and her boyfriend's bedroom. Mother was\n\nsubsequently arrested and charged with child endangerment and Jo.M. and Ja.M were\n\nplaced in the care of nonrelatives pursuant to a voluntary safety plan.\n\n        {\u00b63}    On January 17, 2019, BCDJFS filed a complaint alleging Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\nwere dependent children. In support of its complaint, the Agency referenced the November\n\n6, 2018 incident and Mother's arrest and noted that Mother was incarcerated and had an\n\nanticipated release date of April 4, 2019. The complaint sought to keep Ja.M. and Jo.M. in\n\nthe care of the nonrelatives who had been caring for the boys.\n\n        {\u00b64}    After receiving the Agency's complaint, the juvenile court granted emergency\n\ntemporary custody to the nonrelatives caring for the children. The juvenile court also\n\nappointed a guardian ad litem for Jo.M. and Ja.M. Mother was granted visitation with the\n\nchildren, to be supervised by the nonrelative caregivers.\n\n        {\u00b65}    On March 6, 2019, Jo.M. and Ja.M. were adjudicated dependent following a\n\nstipulation by Mother. Mother waived a bifurcated hearing and the juvenile court entered a\n\n\n\n\n1. Jo.M.'s and Ja.M.'s biological father has not been involved in the boys' lives. He did not participate in any\ncase plan services, did not appear at the permanent custody hearing, and is not a party to the present appeal.\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\ndispositional order placing the children in the continued temporary custody of the\n\nnonrelatives who had been caring for them. At this time, the court adopted a case plan for\n\nMother's reunification with the children. The case plan required Mother to complete a\n\nsubstance abuse and mental illness (\"SAMI\") assessment and to follow through with any\n\nrecommended treatments as a result of that assessment, including attending outpatient\n\ndrug and alcohol treatment, attending mental health counseling, and obtaining a psychiatric\n\nevaluation for medication management. Mother was also required to complete random drug\n\nscreens, maintain stable housing and income, and participate in an in-home parenting\n\neducation program. Mother's longtime boyfriend, who resided with Mother and wished to\n\nbe involved in the children's lives, was also required to complete a SAMI assessment and\n\nfollow through with any recommendations.          The court continued Mother's supervised\n\nvisitation with the children but ordered that the visitations be supervised through the Family\n\nHealing Center.\n\n          {\u00b66}   On July 30, 2019, the Agency filed an emergency motion for change in\n\ntemporary custody.        The Agency sought temporary custody of the children as the\n\nnonrelatives were no longer able to care for Jo.M. and Ja.M. That same date, the juvenile\n\ncourt granted the Agency's motion and the children were placed in the care of a foster\n\nfamily.\n\n          {\u00b67}   Mother made limited progress on her case plan, failing to consistently attend\n\ncounseling, to take or pass drug screens, to maintain stable housing and income, or to\n\nroutinely attend visitation with the children. As a result, on August 3, 2020, the Agency\n\nmoved for permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\n          {\u00b68}   A hearing on the motion was scheduled for December 17, 2020. Two weeks\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f                                                                                Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                       CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-084\n\nbefore the hearing was set to occur, Mother moved for a continuance to a \"later date,\"\n\nasserting that \"due to [the] COVID-19 [pandemic], mother does not feel safe being in the\n\ncourthouse or court room with other individuals.\" Mother's motion was opposed by BCDJFS\n\nand the children's guardian ad litem.            The juvenile court denied Mother's motion for\n\ncontinuance, noting that the court had imposed strict COVID-19 safety protocols in the\n\ncourtroom and that Mother had the option of participating in the proceedings remotely.\n\n        {\u00b69}    On December 15, 2020, the children's guardian ad litem filed a report\n\nrecommending that permanent custody be granted to the Agency. The guardian ad litem\n\nnoted that since the children had been removed from Mother's care in November 2018,\n\nMother had failed to consistently visit with the children or make any real progress on the\n\ncase plan. The guardian ad litem believed granting permanent custody to the Agency was\n\n\"in the best interests of the children and their only option for permanency.\"\n\n        {\u00b610} At the commencement of the December 17, 2020 permanent custody hearing,\n\nMother's counsel orally moved for a continuance of the proceedings on the grounds that\n\nMother was ill and unable to participate due to COVID-19 exposure. Though the Agency\n\nand the children's guardian ad litem opposed continuing the matter, arguing Mother was\n\nmerely seeking to delay proceedings, the court granted a three-month continuance.\n\n        {\u00b611} On March 25, 2021, a permanent custody hearing was held before a juvenile\n\ncourt magistrate. The magistrate heard testimony from the supervisor who oversaw Jo.M.'s\n\nand Ja.M.'s case with the Agency, the children's foster mother, Mother, and one of Mother's\n\nfriends.2\n\n\n\n2. Mother appeared 45 minutes late at the March 25, 2021 permanent custody hearing. Mother's counsel,\nhowever, appeared timely and represented Mother's interests in her absence. Mother was permitted to testify\nat the hearing upon her arrival.\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f                                                                   Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                          CA2021-06-073\n                                                                          CA2021-07-083\n                                                                          CA2021-07-084\n\n      {\u00b612} The supervisor discussed the Agency's history with Mother, noting that\n\nBCDJFS had been involved since November 6, 2018, when Jo.M. had been left alone with\n\na cousin who overdosed while caring for the child. As drugs and drug paraphernalia,\n\nincluding mirrors coated with white residue and needles, were found in the home, the\n\nchildren were removed and placed in the custody of nonrelatives. The children remained\n\nin the nonrelatives care until July 30, 2019, when they were placed in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody. The children have been placed in the same foster family's home since\n\nJuly 30, 2019 and are doing well in that foster placement.\n\n      {\u00b613} The supervisor noted that though a case plan for reunification had been\n\ndeveloped in February 2019 and adopted by the juvenile court in March 2019, Mother had\n\nmade limited progress on her case plan. Mother completed a SAMI assessment and was\n\ndiagnosed with substance abuse issues, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. It was\n\nrecommended that she obtain drug and alcohol treatment, mental health counseling, and a\n\npsychiatric evaluation to manage her medication, as well as attend an employment success\n\nprogram and an in-home parenting education program. Mother \"declined\" to attend the\n\nemployment program. She did engage in counseling at Access Counseling in Middletown,\n\nOhio in March 2019. However, her attendance was sporadic and she frequently refused to\n\nsubmit to drug screens. Mother was unsuccessfully discharged from Access Counseling in\n\nMay 2019.\n\n      {\u00b614} Mother did not attend any other counseling services until August 2020, when\n\nshe was referred to The Next Right Thing.        After obtaining an evaluation and being\n\ndiagnosed with an amphetamine-type substance use disorder, Mother began outpatient\n\ntreatment and counseling. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother's appointments were\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                                                                   Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                          CA2021-06-073\n                                                                          CA2021-07-083\n                                                                          CA2021-07-084\n\nheld virtually or by telephone.    For a couple of months, Mother regularly attended\n\ncounseling, though she refused to complete drug screens when requested by The Next\n\nRight Thing. By November 2020, Mother had begun missing counseling sessions. The last\n\nsession she attended before being unsuccessfully discharged from the program was on\n\nNovember 24, 2020. When discharged, it was recommended that Mother obtain further\n\noutpatient substance abuse treatment and mental health services.\n\n      {\u00b615} Mother did not seek additional treatment until a few weeks before the\n\npermanent custody hearing. In March 2021, Mother was once again referred to Access\n\nCounseling for treatment. However, because it had been years since Mother's last SAMI\n\nassessment, Access Counseling required a new assessment before treatment could begin.\n\nAlthough Mother had completed paperwork with Access Counseling, she had not\n\nundergone the assessment or started treatment as of the date of the permanent custody\n\nhearing.\n\n      {\u00b616} The Agency supervisor discussed the difficulty she had in getting Mother to\n\ncomply with random drug screens. Mother frequently refused or failed to show up for drug\n\nscreens requested by the Agency, Access Counseling, or The Next Right Thing. When\n\nMother did comply with screenings, the majority of her screens came back positive. More\n\nthan a dozen times, Mother tested positive for either methamphetamines, amphetamines,\n\nbenzodiazepines, alcohol, or some combination of those substances.         However, in\n\nDecember 2019, Mother had three negative screens. Mother also had two negative drug\n\nscreens in the first week of March 2021.\n\n      {\u00b617} Mother struggled to maintain stable housing during the pendency of the case.\n\nMother was incarcerated multiple times, spending approximately 30 days in the Middletown\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                                                                Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                       CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-084\n\njail and 80 to 90 days in the Butler County jail for various offenses, including child\n\nendangerment, forgery, identity theft, and an attempt offense.3 When she was not in jail,\n\nMother and her longtime boyfriend moved between the homes of several family members.\n\nMother acknowledged to the Agency that living with relatives was not ideal or \"a good\n\nsituation.\" Nonetheless, after moving out of the home they shared with the cousin who\n\noverdosed, Mother and her boyfriend moved in with Mother's uncle for about 18 months in\n\n2019 and 2020. Mother and her boyfriend then moved in with the children's maternal\n\ngrandmother and great-grandmother in Kentucky for about four or five months. In August\n\nor October 2020, Mother and her boyfriend moved to Centerville, where they rented a studio\n\napartment for three months. Mother and her boyfriend then bought a camper and moved\n\ninto a campground in Carmody for a couple of months. In mid-January 2021, Mother and\n\nher boyfriend rented a two-bedroom townhome in Franklin. The second bedroom was\n\nintended for Jo.M. and Ja.M. The Agency visited the townhome and did not observe any\n\nsafety issues or hazards. However, the supervisor still had concerns about the stability of\n\nMother's housing, noting the brief period of time Mother had been in the townhome.\n\nMother's unstable housing, in combination with her lack of progress in her substance abuse\n\ntreatment, prevented the Agency from making a referral for in-home parenting classes.\n\n        {\u00b618} The supervisor expressed concern over Mother's employment history. The\n\nsupervisor noted Mother had reported working inconsistently throughout the pendency of\n\nthe case. The week of the permanent custody hearing, Mother obtained employment with\n\na Walmart distribution center. However, as Mother had only started the position two days\n\n\n\n\n3 The specifics of Mother's \"attempt\" offense were not discussed at the permanent custody hearing or within\nthe exhibits admitted into evidence.\n\n                                                   -7-\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\nbefore the permanent custody hearing began, this was not long enough for Mother to have\n\nachieved stability in her employment.\n\n       {\u00b619} Mother's relationship with her longtime boyfriend and his lack of involvement\n\nin the case plan was also concerning to the supervisor. Mother's boyfriend has a criminal\n\nhistory involving illegal substances.    He was arrested and charged with drug abuse\n\n(methamphetamines) in February 2019. In March 2019, Mother's boyfriend was again\n\narrested and charged with methamphetamine-related crimes and tampering with records.\n\nAlthough Mother's boyfriend admitted to the police he had a drug abuse problem, he denied\n\nhaving any substance abuse issues when asked by the Agency. Mother's boyfriend was\n\ndiagnosed with an amphetamine use disorder and briefly attended counseling at The Next\n\nRight Thing. However, near the end of 2020, after failing to attend counseling for more than\n\ntwo months, he was unsuccessfully discharged. Mother's boyfriend has not reengaged in\n\nany treatment or counseling services and has refused to submit to any drug screens.\n\n       {\u00b620} The supervisor noted that since the children were removed from Mother's care\n\nin November 2018, Mother's visitation with the children had never progressed beyond\n\nsupervised visitation. Visitation originally occurred in the home of the nonrelative caregivers\n\nbefore being moved to the Family Healing Center.           Once the Agency was awarded\n\ntemporary custody, visitation continued at the Family Healing Center. Mother's visitation\n\nremained at the \"most restricted\" supervision level, which required Mother to have a\n\nsupervisor overseeing the visit \"within eye contact, ear contact, right next to them.\"\n\n       {\u00b621} Mother did not consistently exercise visitation with the children. On May 24\n\n2019, after Mother missed multiple consecutive visits without calling to cancel, Mother was\n\nremoved from the visitation schedule. Mother was added back to the visitation schedule in\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nAugust 2019. In October 2019, Mother's visitation was again suspended after she failed to\n\nattend consecutive visitations. Visits resumed on November 13, 2019 after Mother met with\n\nthe director of the visitation center.\n\n        {\u00b622} Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother's visitations were moved to\n\nvirtual visitations.   The Family Healing Center continued to supervise the visits over\n\nFaceTime.     Mother often cut the virtual visitations short, and the visitation supervisor\n\nreported that Mother had minimal communication during the virtual visits and needed\n\nguidance on how to engage the children. As of May 2020, Mother started missing visitations\n\nwith some frequency, including missed visitations in the months of August 2020, October\n\n2020, and November 2020. On December 17, 2020, the juvenile court suspended Mother's\n\nvisitation until Mother submitted two consecutive negative drug screens and reengaged in\n\nmental health and substance abuse treatment. As of the date of the permanent custody\n\nhearing, Mother had not complied with the latter of those requirements and her visitation\n\nhad not been reinstated.\n\n        {\u00b623} Foster Mother testified Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been in her and her husband's\n\ncare since the end of July 2019, and they have an interest in adopting the boys. Jo.M. and\n\nJa.M. are bonded to their foster parents and their foster parents' two children. Jo.M. and\n\nJa.M. are in first grade and are doing well in school. Both boys attend counseling on a\n\nweekly or biweekly basis depending on their counselor's availability. The boys enjoy playing\n\nbasketball, riding bikes, trampolining, and spending time on the foster family's small hobby\n\nfarm.\n\n        {\u00b624} Foster Mother testified about Jo.M. and Ja.M.'s visitations with Mother, noting\n\nthat since the visitations moved online, Mother has missed a number of the visits. In the\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nFall of 2020, Mother missed four consecutive visits. When Mother did appear for the\n\nvisitations, she did not appear engaged and often ended the calls early. Foster Mother\n\nrecalled that on the boys' birthday, Mother appeared 12 minutes late and ended the visit\n\nafter three minutes with the boys. Foster Mother acknowledged that given the boys' young\n\nage, they sometimes had difficulty staying focused and engaged during the video calls.\n\nHowever, Foster Mother noted that other relatives who had video calls with Jo.M. and Ja.M.,\n\nincluding maternal grandmother and an older sibling, were able to engage with the children.\n\n       {\u00b625} Mother testified that she and the children are bonded. Mother claimed that\n\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic, she routinely visited with the children, missing only a few\n\nvisits. Mother brought Jo.M. and Ja.M. lunch and they played games and did art and crafts\n\nprojects together. Once visitations were made virtual, Mother testified the visits became\n\n\"torture\" and were \"heartbreaking.\" Mother claimed the boys did not like to be on the phone\n\nand would get bored, necessitating an early end to the visitations. Mother also testified that\n\nthere were times the foster family's schedule resulted in a missed visitation and, with the\n\nexception of one occurrence, the missed visitations were not made up.\n\n       {\u00b626} Mother stated she was making progress on her case plan, noting that\n\ntransportation problems hindered her ability to attend counseling and substance abuse\n\nmeetings earlier in the case. However, Mother obtained a vehicle in July 2020. She has\n\nsince sought to restart substance abuse and mental health services at Access Counseling.\n\nIn addition to transportation difficulties, Mother explained she had stopped attending\n\nservices at Access Counseling in 2019 because she was upset her counselor reported\n\ncertain information to the Agency against her wishes.\n\n       {\u00b627} Mother testified that she now lives in housing suitable for caring for Jo.M. and\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nJa.M. She has also recently started a new job with Walmart, one that has her working from\n\n4:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m. When questioned about what she would do for childcare if she\n\nregained custody of the children, Mother indicated she would \"try to change shifts.\"\n\n      {\u00b628} Mother admitted that since the Agency's involvement, both she and her\n\nboyfriend spent periods of time in jail for various criminal offenses. She further admitted\n\nthat both she and her boyfriend have struggled on and off with drug abuse. She claimed\n\nthat she did not miss as many drug screens as the Agency suggested, stating that she had\n\nbeen screened while she was on probation. According to Mother, her drug screens through\n\nthe probation department were negative for illegal substances. This led Mother to believe\n\nthat the results of the drug screens administered by the Agency, which often came back\n\npositive for methamphetamine and amphetamines, were \"not correct.\"\n\n      {\u00b629} Mother also testified that she had been prescribed trazadone, latuda, and\n\nvalium as a result of her 2016 diagnoses for bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression.\n\nMother, on her own initiative, stopped taking the prescribed medication because \"taking\n\nmind-altering drugs does not help.\" Mother also testified that she was diagnosed with\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder and obtained a marijuana prescription card, though the\n\nprescription card was not provided to the Agency or presented as evidence.\n\n      {\u00b630} Mother's friend testified that she and Mother have been friends since they\n\nwere in second grade. Mother's friend testified that Mother was loving and very bonded to\n\nJo.M. and Ja.M. Though Mother could be \"a little lenient\" with the children, the friend never\n\nobserved any behavior that caused her to be concerned with Mother's ability to parent the\n\nchildren. However, on cross-examination, the friend admitted she had not been aware of\n\nMother's substance abuse problems and had not observed Mother interact with the children\n\n\n                                           - 11 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nsince before the children were removed from Mother's care in November 2018.\n\n       {\u00b631} After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the\n\nmagistrate issued a decision granting the Agency permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\nThe magistrate found that it was in the children's best interest for permanent custody to be\n\nawarded, that the children had been in the temporary custody of the Agency for at least 12\n\nmonths of a consecutive 22-month period, and that despite reasonable efforts by the\n\nAgency to prevent the need for placement of the children outside the home, the children\n\ncould not and should not be placed with their mother or father within a reasonable amount\n\nof time.\n\n       {\u00b632} Mother filed timely objections to the magistrate's decision, arguing that it was\n\nnot in the children's best interest for permanent custody to be granted to the Agency, that\n\nthe magistrate's decision was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, and that the\n\nsufficiency and weight of the evidence supported Mother regaining legal custody of the\n\nchildren. On May 25, 2021, the juvenile court held a hearing on Mother's objections.\n\nFollowing the hearing, on June 6, 2021, the juvenile court overruled Mother's objections\n\nand adopted the magistrate's decision in full.\n\n       {\u00b633} Mother now appeals the juvenile court's decision, raising two assignments of\n\nerror for review.\n\n       {\u00b634} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n       {\u00b635} [MOTHER]       WAS      DENIED      THE     ABILITY     AND     REASONABLE\n\nOPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY WITH H[ER] CHILDREN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND\n\nTHE TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE H[ER] CASE PLAN AND REUNIFY SHOULD HAVE\n\nBEEN EXTENDED BY AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS BEFORE PERMANENT\n\n\n                                           - 12 -\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\nCUSTODY WAS CONSIDERED.\n\n       {\u00b636} In her first assignment of error, Mother argues she was denied a reasonable\n\nopportunity to reunify with the children due to the COVID-19 pandemic and contends the\n\njuvenile court should have granted her an additional six months to continue to make\n\nprogress on her case plan before considering the Agency's motion for permanent custody.\n\nMother argues that her \"ability to visit her children and to complete [case plan] services was\n\nput on hold for over 6 months due to the global pandemic\" and, citing health orders issued\n\nby the Governor of Ohio, tolling orders issued by the Ohio Supreme Court, and the federal\n\neviction moratorium, argues that a similar delay in permanent custody proceedings should\n\nhave applied.\n\n       {\u00b637} We note, however, that Mother never moved the juvenile court to extend\n\ntemporary custody or continue the permanent custody proceedings on the grounds that the\n\npandemic impeded her ability to reunify with the children. Instead, Mother asked for a\n\ncontinuance of the permanent custody hearing because she feared being exposed to\n\nCOVID-19 while in the courtroom. Furthermore, when objecting to the magistrate's decision\n\ngranting permanent custody to the Agency, Mother did not raise the issue of a sixth-month\n\nextension of the Agency's temporary custody in order to allow her additional time to\n\ncomplete case plan goals.\n\n       {\u00b638} It is well-settled that issues not raised in the trial court may not ordinarily be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal.

As such, the court could not grant a six-month\n\ncontinuance at the March 25, 2021 hearing as doing so would have brought the case\n\noutside the two-year timeframe set forth in R.C. 2151.353(G) and 2151.415(D)(4).\n\n       {\u00b640} Furthermore, the facts of the present case did not warrant a six-month\n\nextension.

Mother's failure to complete case plan services and reunify with Jo.M.\n\nand Ja.M. were based on Mother's actions, not the limitations presented by the COVID-19\n\npandemic.\n\n       {\u00b641} Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother failed to make progress on case\n\nplan objectives. The case plan was adopted by the juvenile court on March 6, 2019, a full\n\nyear before the pandemic began in March 2020.4 During this time, Mother was in and out\n\nof jail, failed to establish stable housing and employment, failed to routinely visit with the\n\nchildren, resulting in her visitations being suspended in May 2019 and October 2019, and\n\ncontinued to use illegal substances and test positive for methamphetamines,\n\namphetamines, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or a combination of those substances. Mother\n\nalso failed to regularly attend substance abuse and mental health treatments. Although\n\nMother started treatment at Access Counseling in March 2019, she was unsuccessfully\n\ndischarged from the program in May 2019. She did not reengage in services for more than\n\na year, waiting until August 2020 to begin treatment at The Next Right Thing.\n\n       {\u00b642} Once the COVID-19 pandemic began and safety precautions were put into\n\nplace, Mother was given the opportunity to continue case plan services remotely. She\n\nbriefly reengaged in outpatient substance abuse and mental health treatment with The Next\n\nRight Thing in August 2020 by means of telehealth and virtual appointments. However, by\n\nthe end of November 2020, Mother stopped attending counseling sessions and she was\n\nsubsequently discharged from the facility. The Agency requested drug screens from Mother\n\n\n\n4. The Governor of Ohio issued Executive Order 2020-01D declaring a state of emergency in Ohio in response\nto COVID-19 on March 9, 2020. A national emergency was declared by the President of the United States\non March 13, 2020. See In re L.H., 5th Dist.

Mother was given the opportunity to continue visitations with the children using\n\nvideo phone calls, but she frequently missed the visitations or cut short the visitations after\n\nfailing to engage with the children. After Mother's visitation was suspended on December\n\n12, 2020 by the juvenile court, she failed to satisfy the requisite conditions to have visitation\n\nreinstated.\n\n       {\u00b643} Though Mother complains that \"many services were not available during the\n\npandemic,\" the only service that Mother specifically identifies as being \"not offered\" during\n\nthe pandemic was in-home parenting classes.            However, as the Agency supervisor\n\nexplained, the Agency did not refer the parenting classes in accordance with its policy that\n\nin-home parenting classes are not offered until the parent has obtained stable housing and\n\nmade progress with drug treatment. As Mother had only recently moved into her townhouse\n\nand she had not progressed in her substance abuse treatment as of the date of the\n\npermanent custody hearing, it was Mother's lack of case progress, and not the pandemic,\n\nthat prevented Mother from receiving a referral from the Agency for in-home parenting\n\nclasses.\n\n       {\u00b644} The record therefore demonstrates that Mother's failure to complete case plan\n\nservices was not the result of the limitations or restrictions presented by the COVID-19\n\npandemic but, rather, her own actions. As such, we find no merit to Mother's arguments\n\nthat the juvenile court erred by not sua sponte ordering a six-month extension of temporary\n\ncustody to allow her additional time to make progress on her case plan due to the COVID-\n\n19 pandemic. See, e.g., In re C.R., 3d Dist.

This finding is not\n\ndisputed by Mother and is supported by the record, as the children have been in the\n\ntemporary custody of the Agency since July 30, 2019.5 Mother instead disputes the juvenile\n\ncourt's decision finding that permanent custody of the children to the Agency was in Jo.M.'s\n\n\n\n5.

However, the court found that Mother had\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\f                                                                        Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                               CA2021-06-073\n                                                                               CA2021-07-083\n                                                                               CA2021-07-084\n\ndifficulty maintaining visitation with the children throughout the pendency of the case, with\n\nher visitations being suspended on multiple occasions and the \"quality of her visitation\n\n[being] inconsistent over time.\" The court discussed the difficulty Mother had in engaging\n\nthe children during virtual visitations and found that \"[t]owards the end of the visitations that\n\ntook place, most of the observations of bonding [between Mother and the children] were\n\nnoted as poor.\" Furthermore, \"Mother's visitation has remained at the highest level of\n\nsupervision throughout this case.\"\n\n       {\u00b655} In its consideration of R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), the juvenile court noted that it\n\nhad not conducted an in camera interview with Jo.M. and Ja.M., who were seven years old\n\nat the time of the permanent custody hearing. However, the court had considered the report\n\nof the children's guardian ad litem, who recommended that permanent custody be granted\n\nto the Agency.\n\n       {\u00b656} The court then considered the custodial history of the children, as required by\n\nR.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(c). The court noted that the children had been removed from Mother's\n\ncustody for more than 26 months by the time of the permanent custody hearing. When\n\nremoved from Mother's care on November 6, 2018, Jo.M. and Ja.M. were placed with\n\nnonrelative caregivers. The nonrelative caregivers were granted temporary custody of the\n\nchildren on January 17, 2019. Jo.M. and Ja.M. remained in the temporary custody of the\n\nnonrelative caregivers until July 30, 2019, when they were then placed in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody. At the time the Agency moved for permanent custody of the children,\n\nthey had been in the Agency's custody for 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nBy the time of the permanent custody hearing, Jo.M. and Ja.M. had been in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody for 19 months.\n\n\n                                             - 21 -\n\f                                                                        Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                               CA2021-06-073\n                                                                               CA2021-07-083\n                                                                               CA2021-07-084\n\n       {\u00b657} In considering R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(d), the juvenile court found that the\n\nchildren were in need of legally secure placement and that their need for such placement\n\ncould not be obtained without a grant of permanent custody to the Agency. The court\n\ndiscussed Mother's limited progress in meeting case plan services, her failure to address\n\nthe substance abuse issues that initially led to the children's removal, and her continued\n\ninvolvement with her boyfriend, someone that the court determined \"remain[ed] a significant\n\nsource of concern.\" The juvenile court stated, in relevant part, that\n\n              Mother has not successfully engaged in substance abuse and\n              mental health services. * * * She has not complied with random\n              drug screens. She has been transient for much of this case,\n              and not held stable employment. Her visitations with the\n              children were ultimately suspended, and she has failed to meet\n              the criteria to have them reinstated due to lack of compliance\n              with treatment. She continues to reside with her paramour who\n              also has substance abuse issues, and he has refused to comply\n              with treatment and screening.\n\n       {\u00b658} Furthermore, the court noted that more than two years after the children's\n\nremoval from Mother's custody, \"Mother continue[d] to lack insight into the reasons for the\n\nchild[ren]'s removal or the importance of making changes to remedy the conditions for the\n\nremoval.\"\n\n       {\u00b659} The juvenile court further stated that despite efforts by the Agency, no\n\nappropriate relatives or nonrelatives were found for placement of the children. The court\n\nnoted that several home study assessments had been initiated but were \"ultimately\n\nwithdrawn after the families either failed to follow through or were withdrawn.\" No other\n\nappropriate relatives or nonrelatives had filed a motion for legal custody of the children as\n\nan alternative to the permanent custody motion.\n\n       {\u00b660} As it pertained to Mother, the court found that the factors set forth in R.C.\n\n\n                                            - 22 -\n\f                                                                            Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                   CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                   CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                   CA2021-07-084\n\n2151.414(E)(7) to (11) did not apply.6\n\n       {\u00b661} Based on its consideration of all relevant factors in accordance with R.C.\n\n2151.414(D), the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in Jo.M.'s\n\nand Ja.M.'s best interest to grant permanent custody to the Agency.\n\n       {\u00b662} Mother disputes the juvenile court's findings and argues that the evidence\n\ndoes not support the grant of permanent custody. Mother asserts that she has made\n\nsignificant progress towards her case plan, \"complet[ing] all case plan services except for\n\none in home parenting class,\" and argues that the reasons the children were removed from\n\nher home are no longer an issue. Mother contends she is \"clean and sober,\" employed full-\n\ntime, and has a \"two-bedroom home that is safe and appropriate\" for the children.\n\n       {\u00b663} As an initial matter, we note that \"the completion of case plan services alone\n\ndoes not equate to, or necessitate, a finding that the parents have substantially remedied\n\nthe conditions that caused the removal of the child from the home.\" In re R.K., 12th Dist.\n\nWarren Nos. CA2021-03-027 and CA2021-03-028, 2021-Ohio-3074, \u00b6 24, citing In re S.M.,\n\n12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2015-01-003, 2015-Ohio-2318, \u00b6 24.                     \"[A] parent can\n\nsuccessfully complete the requirements of a case plan, but not substantially remedy the\n\nconditions that caused the children to be removed, as the case plan is 'simply a means to\n\na goal, but not the goal itself.'\" Id., quoting In re E.B., 12th Dist.

CA2009-10-\n\n139 and CA2009-11-146, 2010-Ohio-1122, \u00b6 30.\n\n       {\u00b664} However, in the present case, the record does not support Mother's\n\ncontention that she has completed all but one case plan service. While Mother has made\n\nsome progress towards her case plan goals, Mother has failed to address the substance\n\n\n6. Father was found to have abandoned the children. R.C. 2151.414(E)(10).\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nabuse and mental health issues that led to the children's removal in November 2018. As of\n\nthe date of the permanent custody hearing, Mother had not successfully completed a mental\n\nhealth or substance abuse treatment program.        In fact, she had been unsuccessfully\n\ndischarged from two treatment facilities and was merely in the process of reengaging one\n\nof those facilities for treatment.   Though Mother had filled out paperwork at Access\n\nCounseling, she had not restarted treatment.\n\n        {\u00b665} Furthermore, while Mother passed two drug screens administered at the\n\nbeginning of March 2021, Mother had not demonstrated her ability to remain sober for any\n\nsignificant period of time.   Excluding the March 2021 negative screens, Mother's last\n\nnegative screen for the Agency was in December 2019.\n\n        {\u00b666} Mother's failure to make progress on her substance abuse and mental health\n\ntreatment prevented the Agency from making a referral for in-home parenting classes. Her\n\nfailure to reengage in mental health and substance abuse treatment also prevented Mother\n\nfrom having her visitation reinstated after it was suspended by the court on December 17,\n\n2020.\n\n        {\u00b667} Mother's housing and employment were also very new and did not\n\ndemonstrate a period of stability. While Mother's housing had been deemed appropriate\n\nby the Agency, she had only resided in the home for approximately two months as of the\n\ndate of the permanent custody hearing. Prior to that date, Mother spent different periods\n\nof time incarcerated, living with various family members, living at a campground, and living\n\nin a studio apartment. Mother also continued to reside with her longtime boyfriend, an\n\nindividual who had been in and out of jail on various drug-related offenses. Mother admitted\n\nthat her boyfriend struggled with drug abuse and was not engaged in treatment for his\n\n\n                                           - 24 -\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nsubstance abuse issues.\n\n       {\u00b668} As for her employment, Mother had started a new job only a few days before\n\nthe permanent custody hearing. This job required Mother to work from 4:00 p.m. until 2:00\n\na.m. Mother did not have any real plans on how she would arrange for childcare during her\n\nwork hours. She simply hoped that she would be able to change her shift.\n\n       {\u00b669} In addition to not making progress on the majority of her case plan goals, the\n\nrecord reflects that Mother does not recognize why the children were removed from her\n\ncustody or the need for changes to her lifestyle in order to ensure the health, safety, and\n\nstability of the children. When asked about her personal habits and what in particular she\n\nwould do differently if she regained custody of the children, Mother stated, \"Umm\u2026I don't,\n\nI don't really know because I don't know exactly what I have [done].\" Mother did not see a\n\nproblem with continuing to reside with her drug-using boyfriend. Despite acknowledging\n\nthat she and her boyfriend went on \"drug binges\" together, where they not only used illegal\n\nsubstances but also committed crimes by writing \"bad checks,\" Mother believed it would be\n\nappropriate to have the children around her boyfriend as her boyfriend was the only father\n\nfigure Jo.M. and Ja.M. had ever known. Mother also thought it was appropriate, on her own\n\naccord, to stop taking the medication prescribed to her for her bipolar disorder, anxiety, and\n\ndepression. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, we agree with the juvenile\n\ncourt that Mother's statements and actions demonstrate her lack of insight and\n\nunwillingness to create a safe and stable environment for Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\n       {\u00b670} In contrast, the record shows that the children have gained safety and stability\n\nwhile in the Agency's custody. Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been placed with the same foster\n\nfamily since the end of July 2019. By all accounts, the children are doing well in the\n\n\n                                            - 25 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nplacement and are bonded to their foster family. The foster parents indicated a desire to\n\nadopt the children.\n\n      {\u00b671} As this court has previously recognized, \"'[a] child's best interests are served\n\nby the child being placed in a permanent situation that fosters growth, stability, and\n\nsecurity.'\" In re D.E., 2018-Ohio-3341 at \u00b6 60, quoting In re Keaton, 4th Dist. Ross Nos.\n\n04CA2785 and 04CA2788, 2014-Ohio-6210, \u00b6 61. The juvenile court's decision does just\n\nthat. Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been removed from Mother's care since November 6, 2018.\n\nDespite diligent and reasonable efforts by the Agency, Mother has been unable to remedy\n\nthe conditions that caused the children's removal. The children are in need of legally secure\n\npermanent placement, and it is in their best interest for permanent custody to be awarded\n\nto the Agency. Therefore, in light of the foregoing considerations, we find that the juvenile\n\ncourt's decision to grant permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M. to the Agency was\n\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence. Mother's second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n      {\u00b672} Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n      PIPER, P.J., and M.

Officers found Jo.M. had been left alone with Mother's cousin, who had overdosed\n\nwhile Jo.M. was present. Officers found drugs, needles, and other drug paraphernalia\n\nwithin reach of the children, including in Mother's and her boyfriend's bedroom. Mother was\n\nsubsequently arrested and charged with child endangerment and Jo.M. and Ja.M were\n\nplaced in the care of nonrelatives pursuant to a voluntary safety plan.\n\n        {\u00b63}    On January 17, 2019, BCDJFS filed a complaint alleging Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\nwere dependent children. In support of its complaint, the Agency referenced the November\n\n6, 2018 incident and Mother's arrest and noted that Mother was incarcerated and had an\n\nanticipated release date of April 4, 2019. The complaint sought to keep Ja.M. and Jo.M. in\n\nthe care of the nonrelatives who had been caring for the boys.\n\n        {\u00b64}    After receiving the Agency's complaint, the juvenile court granted emergency\n\ntemporary custody to the nonrelatives caring for the children. The juvenile court also\n\nappointed a guardian ad litem for Jo.M. and Ja.M. Mother was granted visitation with the\n\nchildren, to be supervised by the nonrelative caregivers.\n\n        {\u00b65}    On March 6, 2019, Jo.M. and Ja.M. were adjudicated dependent following a\n\nstipulation by Mother. Mother waived a bifurcated hearing and the juvenile court entered a\n\n\n\n\n1. Jo.M.'s and Ja.M.'s biological father has not been involved in the boys' lives. He did not participate in any\ncase plan services, did not appear at the permanent custody hearing, and is not a party to the present appeal.\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\ndispositional order placing the children in the continued temporary custody of the\n\nnonrelatives who had been caring for them. At this time, the court adopted a case plan for\n\nMother's reunification with the children. The case plan required Mother to complete a\n\nsubstance abuse and mental illness (\"SAMI\") assessment and to follow through with any\n\nrecommended treatments as a result of that assessment, including attending outpatient\n\ndrug and alcohol treatment, attending mental health counseling, and obtaining a psychiatric\n\nevaluation for medication management. Mother was also required to complete random drug\n\nscreens, maintain stable housing and income, and participate in an in-home parenting\n\neducation program. Mother's longtime boyfriend, who resided with Mother and wished to\n\nbe involved in the children's lives, was also required to complete a SAMI assessment and\n\nfollow through with any recommendations.          The court continued Mother's supervised\n\nvisitation with the children but ordered that the visitations be supervised through the Family\n\nHealing Center.\n\n          {\u00b66}   On July 30, 2019, the Agency filed an emergency motion for change in\n\ntemporary custody.        The Agency sought temporary custody of the children as the\n\nnonrelatives were no longer able to care for Jo.M. and Ja.M. That same date, the juvenile\n\ncourt granted the Agency's motion and the children were placed in the care of a foster\n\nfamily.\n\n          {\u00b67}   Mother made limited progress on her case plan, failing to consistently attend\n\ncounseling, to take or pass drug screens, to maintain stable housing and income, or to\n\nroutinely attend visitation with the children. As a result, on August 3, 2020, the Agency\n\nmoved for permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\n          {\u00b68}   A hearing on the motion was scheduled for December 17, 2020. Two weeks\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f                                                                                Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                       CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-084\n\nbefore the hearing was set to occur, Mother moved for a continuance to a \"later date,\"\n\nasserting that \"due to [the] COVID-19 [pandemic], mother does not feel safe being in the\n\ncourthouse or court room with other individuals.\" Mother's motion was opposed by BCDJFS\n\nand the children's guardian ad litem.            The juvenile court denied Mother's motion for\n\ncontinuance, noting that the court had imposed strict COVID-19 safety protocols in the\n\ncourtroom and that Mother had the option of participating in the proceedings remotely.\n\n        {\u00b69}    On December 15, 2020, the children's guardian ad litem filed a report\n\nrecommending that permanent custody be granted to the Agency. The guardian ad litem\n\nnoted that since the children had been removed from Mother's care in November 2018,\n\nMother had failed to consistently visit with the children or make any real progress on the\n\ncase plan. The guardian ad litem believed granting permanent custody to the Agency was\n\n\"in the best interests of the children and their only option for permanency.\"\n\n        {\u00b610} At the commencement of the December 17, 2020 permanent custody hearing,\n\nMother's counsel orally moved for a continuance of the proceedings on the grounds that\n\nMother was ill and unable to participate due to COVID-19 exposure. Though the Agency\n\nand the children's guardian ad litem opposed continuing the matter, arguing Mother was\n\nmerely seeking to delay proceedings, the court granted a three-month continuance.\n\n        {\u00b611} On March 25, 2021, a permanent custody hearing was held before a juvenile\n\ncourt magistrate. The magistrate heard testimony from the supervisor who oversaw Jo.M.'s\n\nand Ja.M.'s case with the Agency, the children's foster mother, Mother, and one of Mother's\n\nfriends.2\n\n\n\n2. Mother appeared 45 minutes late at the March 25, 2021 permanent custody hearing. Mother's counsel,\nhowever, appeared timely and represented Mother's interests in her absence. Mother was permitted to testify\nat the hearing upon her arrival.\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f                                                                   Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                          CA2021-06-073\n                                                                          CA2021-07-083\n                                                                          CA2021-07-084\n\n      {\u00b612} The supervisor discussed the Agency's history with Mother, noting that\n\nBCDJFS had been involved since November 6, 2018, when Jo.M. had been left alone with\n\na cousin who overdosed while caring for the child. As drugs and drug paraphernalia,\n\nincluding mirrors coated with white residue and needles, were found in the home, the\n\nchildren were removed and placed in the custody of nonrelatives. The children remained\n\nin the nonrelatives care until July 30, 2019, when they were placed in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody. The children have been placed in the same foster family's home since\n\nJuly 30, 2019 and are doing well in that foster placement.\n\n      {\u00b613} The supervisor noted that though a case plan for reunification had been\n\ndeveloped in February 2019 and adopted by the juvenile court in March 2019, Mother had\n\nmade limited progress on her case plan. Mother completed a SAMI assessment and was\n\ndiagnosed with substance abuse issues, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. It was\n\nrecommended that she obtain drug and alcohol treatment, mental health counseling, and a\n\npsychiatric evaluation to manage her medication, as well as attend an employment success\n\nprogram and an in-home parenting education program. Mother \"declined\" to attend the\n\nemployment program. She did engage in counseling at Access Counseling in Middletown,\n\nOhio in March 2019. However, her attendance was sporadic and she frequently refused to\n\nsubmit to drug screens. Mother was unsuccessfully discharged from Access Counseling in\n\nMay 2019.\n\n      {\u00b614} Mother did not attend any other counseling services until August 2020, when\n\nshe was referred to The Next Right Thing.        After obtaining an evaluation and being\n\ndiagnosed with an amphetamine-type substance use disorder, Mother began outpatient\n\ntreatment and counseling. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother's appointments were\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                                                                   Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                          CA2021-06-073\n                                                                          CA2021-07-083\n                                                                          CA2021-07-084\n\nheld virtually or by telephone.    For a couple of months, Mother regularly attended\n\ncounseling, though she refused to complete drug screens when requested by The Next\n\nRight Thing. By November 2020, Mother had begun missing counseling sessions. The last\n\nsession she attended before being unsuccessfully discharged from the program was on\n\nNovember 24, 2020. When discharged, it was recommended that Mother obtain further\n\noutpatient substance abuse treatment and mental health services.\n\n      {\u00b615} Mother did not seek additional treatment until a few weeks before the\n\npermanent custody hearing. In March 2021, Mother was once again referred to Access\n\nCounseling for treatment. However, because it had been years since Mother's last SAMI\n\nassessment, Access Counseling required a new assessment before treatment could begin.\n\nAlthough Mother had completed paperwork with Access Counseling, she had not\n\nundergone the assessment or started treatment as of the date of the permanent custody\n\nhearing.\n\n      {\u00b616} The Agency supervisor discussed the difficulty she had in getting Mother to\n\ncomply with random drug screens. Mother frequently refused or failed to show up for drug\n\nscreens requested by the Agency, Access Counseling, or The Next Right Thing. When\n\nMother did comply with screenings, the majority of her screens came back positive. More\n\nthan a dozen times, Mother tested positive for either methamphetamines, amphetamines,\n\nbenzodiazepines, alcohol, or some combination of those substances.         However, in\n\nDecember 2019, Mother had three negative screens. Mother also had two negative drug\n\nscreens in the first week of March 2021.\n\n      {\u00b617} Mother struggled to maintain stable housing during the pendency of the case.\n\nMother was incarcerated multiple times, spending approximately 30 days in the Middletown\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                                                                Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                       CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-084\n\njail and 80 to 90 days in the Butler County jail for various offenses, including child\n\nendangerment, forgery, identity theft, and an attempt offense.3 When she was not in jail,\n\nMother and her longtime boyfriend moved between the homes of several family members.\n\nMother acknowledged to the Agency that living with relatives was not ideal or \"a good\n\nsituation.\" Nonetheless, after moving out of the home they shared with the cousin who\n\noverdosed, Mother and her boyfriend moved in with Mother's uncle for about 18 months in\n\n2019 and 2020. Mother and her boyfriend then moved in with the children's maternal\n\ngrandmother and great-grandmother in Kentucky for about four or five months. In August\n\nor October 2020, Mother and her boyfriend moved to Centerville, where they rented a studio\n\napartment for three months. Mother and her boyfriend then bought a camper and moved\n\ninto a campground in Carmody for a couple of months. In mid-January 2021, Mother and\n\nher boyfriend rented a two-bedroom townhome in Franklin. The second bedroom was\n\nintended for Jo.M. and Ja.M. The Agency visited the townhome and did not observe any\n\nsafety issues or hazards. However, the supervisor still had concerns about the stability of\n\nMother's housing, noting the brief period of time Mother had been in the townhome.\n\nMother's unstable housing, in combination with her lack of progress in her substance abuse\n\ntreatment, prevented the Agency from making a referral for in-home parenting classes.\n\n        {\u00b618} The supervisor expressed concern over Mother's employment history. The\n\nsupervisor noted Mother had reported working inconsistently throughout the pendency of\n\nthe case. The week of the permanent custody hearing, Mother obtained employment with\n\na Walmart distribution center. However, as Mother had only started the position two days\n\n\n\n\n3 The specifics of Mother's \"attempt\" offense were not discussed at the permanent custody hearing or within\nthe exhibits admitted into evidence.\n\n                                                   -7-\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\nbefore the permanent custody hearing began, this was not long enough for Mother to have\n\nachieved stability in her employment.\n\n       {\u00b619} Mother's relationship with her longtime boyfriend and his lack of involvement\n\nin the case plan was also concerning to the supervisor. Mother's boyfriend has a criminal\n\nhistory involving illegal substances.    He was arrested and charged with drug abuse\n\n(methamphetamines) in February 2019. In March 2019, Mother's boyfriend was again\n\narrested and charged with methamphetamine-related crimes and tampering with records.\n\nAlthough Mother's boyfriend admitted to the police he had a drug abuse problem, he denied\n\nhaving any substance abuse issues when asked by the Agency. Mother's boyfriend was\n\ndiagnosed with an amphetamine use disorder and briefly attended counseling at The Next\n\nRight Thing. However, near the end of 2020, after failing to attend counseling for more than\n\ntwo months, he was unsuccessfully discharged. Mother's boyfriend has not reengaged in\n\nany treatment or counseling services and has refused to submit to any drug screens.\n\n       {\u00b620} The supervisor noted that since the children were removed from Mother's care\n\nin November 2018, Mother's visitation with the children had never progressed beyond\n\nsupervised visitation. Visitation originally occurred in the home of the nonrelative caregivers\n\nbefore being moved to the Family Healing Center.           Once the Agency was awarded\n\ntemporary custody, visitation continued at the Family Healing Center. Mother's visitation\n\nremained at the \"most restricted\" supervision level, which required Mother to have a\n\nsupervisor overseeing the visit \"within eye contact, ear contact, right next to them.\"\n\n       {\u00b621} Mother did not consistently exercise visitation with the children. On May 24\n\n2019, after Mother missed multiple consecutive visits without calling to cancel, Mother was\n\nremoved from the visitation schedule. Mother was added back to the visitation schedule in\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nAugust 2019. In October 2019, Mother's visitation was again suspended after she failed to\n\nattend consecutive visitations. Visits resumed on November 13, 2019 after Mother met with\n\nthe director of the visitation center.\n\n        {\u00b622} Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother's visitations were moved to\n\nvirtual visitations.   The Family Healing Center continued to supervise the visits over\n\nFaceTime.     Mother often cut the virtual visitations short, and the visitation supervisor\n\nreported that Mother had minimal communication during the virtual visits and needed\n\nguidance on how to engage the children. As of May 2020, Mother started missing visitations\n\nwith some frequency, including missed visitations in the months of August 2020, October\n\n2020, and November 2020. On December 17, 2020, the juvenile court suspended Mother's\n\nvisitation until Mother submitted two consecutive negative drug screens and reengaged in\n\nmental health and substance abuse treatment. As of the date of the permanent custody\n\nhearing, Mother had not complied with the latter of those requirements and her visitation\n\nhad not been reinstated.\n\n        {\u00b623} Foster Mother testified Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been in her and her husband's\n\ncare since the end of July 2019, and they have an interest in adopting the boys. Jo.M. and\n\nJa.M. are bonded to their foster parents and their foster parents' two children. Jo.M. and\n\nJa.M. are in first grade and are doing well in school. Both boys attend counseling on a\n\nweekly or biweekly basis depending on their counselor's availability. The boys enjoy playing\n\nbasketball, riding bikes, trampolining, and spending time on the foster family's small hobby\n\nfarm.\n\n        {\u00b624} Foster Mother testified about Jo.M. and Ja.M.'s visitations with Mother, noting\n\nthat since the visitations moved online, Mother has missed a number of the visits.

When Mother did appear for the\n\nvisitations, she did not appear engaged and often ended the calls early. Foster Mother\n\nrecalled that on the boys' birthday, Mother appeared 12 minutes late and ended the visit\n\nafter three minutes with the boys. Foster Mother acknowledged that given the boys' young\n\nage, they sometimes had difficulty staying focused and engaged during the video calls.\n\nHowever, Foster Mother noted that other relatives who had video calls with Jo.M. and Ja.M.,\n\nincluding maternal grandmother and an older sibling, were able to engage with the children.\n\n       {\u00b625} Mother testified that she and the children are bonded. Mother claimed that\n\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic, she routinely visited with the children, missing only a few\n\nvisits. Mother brought Jo.M. and Ja.M. lunch and they played games and did art and crafts\n\nprojects together. Once visitations were made virtual, Mother testified the visits became\n\n\"torture\" and were \"heartbreaking.\" Mother claimed the boys did not like to be on the phone\n\nand would get bored, necessitating an early end to the visitations. Mother also testified that\n\nthere were times the foster family's schedule resulted in a missed visitation and, with the\n\nexception of one occurrence, the missed visitations were not made up.\n\n       {\u00b626} Mother stated she was making progress on her case plan, noting that\n\ntransportation problems hindered her ability to attend counseling and substance abuse\n\nmeetings earlier in the case. However, Mother obtained a vehicle in July 2020. She has\n\nsince sought to restart substance abuse and mental health services at Access Counseling.\n\nIn addition to transportation difficulties, Mother explained she had stopped attending\n\nservices at Access Counseling in 2019 because she was upset her counselor reported\n\ncertain information to the Agency against her wishes.\n\n       {\u00b627} Mother testified that she now lives in housing suitable for caring for Jo.M. and\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nJa.M. She has also recently started a new job with Walmart, one that has her working from\n\n4:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m. When questioned about what she would do for childcare if she\n\nregained custody of the children, Mother indicated she would \"try to change shifts.\"\n\n      {\u00b628} Mother admitted that since the Agency's involvement, both she and her\n\nboyfriend spent periods of time in jail for various criminal offenses. She further admitted\n\nthat both she and her boyfriend have struggled on and off with drug abuse. She claimed\n\nthat she did not miss as many drug screens as the Agency suggested, stating that she had\n\nbeen screened while she was on probation. According to Mother, her drug screens through\n\nthe probation department were negative for illegal substances. This led Mother to believe\n\nthat the results of the drug screens administered by the Agency, which often came back\n\npositive for methamphetamine and amphetamines, were \"not correct.\"\n\n      {\u00b629} Mother also testified that she had been prescribed trazadone, latuda, and\n\nvalium as a result of her 2016 diagnoses for bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression.\n\nMother, on her own initiative, stopped taking the prescribed medication because \"taking\n\nmind-altering drugs does not help.\" Mother also testified that she was diagnosed with\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder and obtained a marijuana prescription card, though the\n\nprescription card was not provided to the Agency or presented as evidence.\n\n      {\u00b630} Mother's friend testified that she and Mother have been friends since they\n\nwere in second grade. Mother's friend testified that Mother was loving and very bonded to\n\nJo.M. and Ja.M. Though Mother could be \"a little lenient\" with the children, the friend never\n\nobserved any behavior that caused her to be concerned with Mother's ability to parent the\n\nchildren. However, on cross-examination, the friend admitted she had not been aware of\n\nMother's substance abuse problems and had not observed Mother interact with the children\n\n\n                                           - 11 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nsince before the children were removed from Mother's care in November 2018.\n\n       {\u00b631} After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the\n\nmagistrate issued a decision granting the Agency permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\nThe magistrate found that it was in the children's best interest for permanent custody to be\n\nawarded, that the children had been in the temporary custody of the Agency for at least 12\n\nmonths of a consecutive 22-month period, and that despite reasonable efforts by the\n\nAgency to prevent the need for placement of the children outside the home, the children\n\ncould not and should not be placed with their mother or father within a reasonable amount\n\nof time.\n\n       {\u00b632} Mother filed timely objections to the magistrate's decision, arguing that it was\n\nnot in the children's best interest for permanent custody to be granted to the Agency, that\n\nthe magistrate's decision was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, and that the\n\nsufficiency and weight of the evidence supported Mother regaining legal custody of the\n\nchildren. On May 25, 2021, the juvenile court held a hearing on Mother's objections.\n\nFollowing the hearing, on June 6, 2021, the juvenile court overruled Mother's objections\n\nand adopted the magistrate's decision in full.\n\n       {\u00b633} Mother now appeals the juvenile court's decision, raising two assignments of\n\nerror for review.\n\n       {\u00b634} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n       {\u00b635} [MOTHER]       WAS      DENIED      THE     ABILITY     AND     REASONABLE\n\nOPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY WITH H[ER] CHILDREN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND\n\nTHE TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE H[ER] CASE PLAN AND REUNIFY SHOULD HAVE\n\nBEEN EXTENDED BY AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS BEFORE PERMANENT\n\n\n                                           - 12 -\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\nCUSTODY WAS CONSIDERED.\n\n       {\u00b636} In her first assignment of error, Mother argues she was denied a reasonable\n\nopportunity to reunify with the children due to the COVID-19 pandemic and contends the\n\njuvenile court should have granted her an additional six months to continue to make\n\nprogress on her case plan before considering the Agency's motion for permanent custody.\n\nMother argues that her \"ability to visit her children and to complete [case plan] services was\n\nput on hold for over 6 months due to the global pandemic\" and, citing health orders issued\n\nby the Governor of Ohio, tolling orders issued by the Ohio Supreme Court, and the federal\n\neviction moratorium, argues that a similar delay in permanent custody proceedings should\n\nhave applied.\n\n       {\u00b637} We note, however, that Mother never moved the juvenile court to extend\n\ntemporary custody or continue the permanent custody proceedings on the grounds that the\n\npandemic impeded her ability to reunify with the children. Instead, Mother asked for a\n\ncontinuance of the permanent custody hearing because she feared being exposed to\n\nCOVID-19 while in the courtroom. Furthermore, when objecting to the magistrate's decision\n\ngranting permanent custody to the Agency, Mother did not raise the issue of a sixth-month\n\nextension of the Agency's temporary custody in order to allow her additional time to\n\ncomplete case plan goals.\n\n       {\u00b638} It is well-settled that issues not raised in the trial court may not ordinarily be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal.

As such, the court could not grant a six-month\n\ncontinuance at the March 25, 2021 hearing as doing so would have brought the case\n\noutside the two-year timeframe set forth in R.C. 2151.353(G) and 2151.415(D)(4).\n\n       {\u00b640} Furthermore, the facts of the present case did not warrant a six-month\n\nextension.

Mother's failure to complete case plan services and reunify with Jo.M.\n\nand Ja.M. were based on Mother's actions, not the limitations presented by the COVID-19\n\npandemic.\n\n       {\u00b641} Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother failed to make progress on case\n\nplan objectives. The case plan was adopted by the juvenile court on March 6, 2019, a full\n\nyear before the pandemic began in March 2020.4 During this time, Mother was in and out\n\nof jail, failed to establish stable housing and employment, failed to routinely visit with the\n\nchildren, resulting in her visitations being suspended in May 2019 and October 2019, and\n\ncontinued to use illegal substances and test positive for methamphetamines,\n\namphetamines, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or a combination of those substances. Mother\n\nalso failed to regularly attend substance abuse and mental health treatments. Although\n\nMother started treatment at Access Counseling in March 2019, she was unsuccessfully\n\ndischarged from the program in May 2019. She did not reengage in services for more than\n\na year, waiting until August 2020 to begin treatment at The Next Right Thing.\n\n       {\u00b642} Once the COVID-19 pandemic began and safety precautions were put into\n\nplace, Mother was given the opportunity to continue case plan services remotely. She\n\nbriefly reengaged in outpatient substance abuse and mental health treatment with The Next\n\nRight Thing in August 2020 by means of telehealth and virtual appointments. However, by\n\nthe end of November 2020, Mother stopped attending counseling sessions and she was\n\nsubsequently discharged from the facility. The Agency requested drug screens from Mother\n\n\n\n4. The Governor of Ohio issued Executive Order 2020-01D declaring a state of emergency in Ohio in response\nto COVID-19 on March 9, 2020. A national emergency was declared by the President of the United States\non March 13, 2020. See In re L.H., 5th Dist.

Mother was given the opportunity to continue visitations with the children using\n\nvideo phone calls, but she frequently missed the visitations or cut short the visitations after\n\nfailing to engage with the children. After Mother's visitation was suspended on December\n\n12, 2020 by the juvenile court, she failed to satisfy the requisite conditions to have visitation\n\nreinstated.\n\n       {\u00b643} Though Mother complains that \"many services were not available during the\n\npandemic,\" the only service that Mother specifically identifies as being \"not offered\" during\n\nthe pandemic was in-home parenting classes.            However, as the Agency supervisor\n\nexplained, the Agency did not refer the parenting classes in accordance with its policy that\n\nin-home parenting classes are not offered until the parent has obtained stable housing and\n\nmade progress with drug treatment. As Mother had only recently moved into her townhouse\n\nand she had not progressed in her substance abuse treatment as of the date of the\n\npermanent custody hearing, it was Mother's lack of case progress, and not the pandemic,\n\nthat prevented Mother from receiving a referral from the Agency for in-home parenting\n\nclasses.\n\n       {\u00b644} The record therefore demonstrates that Mother's failure to complete case plan\n\nservices was not the result of the limitations or restrictions presented by the COVID-19\n\npandemic but, rather, her own actions. As such, we find no merit to Mother's arguments\n\nthat the juvenile court erred by not sua sponte ordering a six-month extension of temporary\n\ncustody to allow her additional time to make progress on her case plan due to the COVID-\n\n19 pandemic. See, e.g., In re C.R., 3d Dist.

First, the juvenile court must find that the grant of permanent\n\ncustody to the agency is in the best interest of the child, utilizing, in part, the factors set forth\n\nin R.C. 2151.414(D). In re D.K.W., 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2014-02-001, 2014-Ohio-2896,\n\n\u00b6 21. Second, pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) to (e), the juvenile court must find that\n\nany of the following apply: (1) the child is abandoned; (2) the child is orphaned; (3) the child\n\nhas been in the temporary custody of the agency for at least 12 months of a consecutive\n\n22-month period; (4) where the preceding three factors do not apply, the child cannot be\n\nplaced with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent;\n\nor (5) the child or another child in the custody of the parent from whose custody the child\n\nhas been removed, has been adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent child on\n\nthree separate occasions. In re C.B., 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2015-04-033, 2015-Ohio-\n\n3709, \u00b6 10. Only one of these findings must be met to satisfy the second prong of the two-\n\npart permanent custody test. In re A.W., 12th Dist. Fayette No. CA2014-03-005, 2014-\n\nOhio- 3188, \u00b6 12.\n\n        {\u00b651} In this case, the juvenile court found that Jo.M. and Ja.M. had been in the\n\ntemporary custody of BCDJFS for at least 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period at\n\nthe time the Agency moved for permanent custody on August 3, 2020. This finding is not\n\ndisputed by Mother and is supported by the record, as the children have been in the\n\ntemporary custody of the Agency since July 30, 2019.5 Mother instead disputes the juvenile\n\ncourt's decision finding that permanent custody of the children to the Agency was in Jo.M.'s\n\n\n\n5. The juvenile court also found that the children could not be placed with either parent within a reasonable\ntime, which Mother disputes. We need not address this argument, however, because the children have been\nin the custody of the Agency for more than 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period, thereby establishing\nthe second prong of the permanent custody analysis. See In re R.K., 12th Dist. Warren Nos.

We find no merit to Mother's arguments.\n\n       {\u00b652} When considering the best interest of a child in a permanent custody case,\n\nthe juvenile court is required under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) to consider all relevant factors. In\n\nre D.E., 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2018-03-035 and CA2018-04-038, 2018-Ohio-3341, \u00b6\n\n32. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the interaction and interrelationship of\n\nthe child with the child's parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home\n\nproviders, and any other person who may significantly affect the child; (2) the wishes of the\n\nchild, as expressed directly by the child or through the child's guardian ad litem; (3) the\n\ncustodial history of the child; (4) the child's need for a legally secure permanent placement\n\nand whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody\n\nto the agency; and (5) whether any of the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) thru (11)\n\napply in relation to the parents and child. In re J.C., 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2017-11-015,\n\n2018-Ohio-1687, \u00b6 22, citing R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(a) thru (e).\n\n       {\u00b653} Initially, with respect to the children's relevant interactions and relationships\n\nwith those who may significantly impact their young lives, the juvenile court found that the\n\nchildren are doing well in their placement with the foster family. The court noted the children\n\nare bonded to their foster parents and their foster parents' biological children and the foster\n\nfamily has expressed an interest in adopting Jo.M. and Ja.M. While in the foster family's\n\ncare, the children have had video calls with their maternal grandmother and an older sister,\n\nbut the court found that \"[t]he strength of any bond with [these] relatives [was] not able to\n\nbe determined.\"\n\n       {\u00b654} As for the children's relationship with Mother, the court noted Mother had\n\nindicated she and the children were bonded. However, the court found that Mother had\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\f                                                                        Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                               CA2021-06-073\n                                                                               CA2021-07-083\n                                                                               CA2021-07-084\n\ndifficulty maintaining visitation with the children throughout the pendency of the case, with\n\nher visitations being suspended on multiple occasions and the \"quality of her visitation\n\n[being] inconsistent over time.\" The court discussed the difficulty Mother had in engaging\n\nthe children during virtual visitations and found that \"[t]owards the end of the visitations that\n\ntook place, most of the observations of bonding [between Mother and the children] were\n\nnoted as poor.\" Furthermore, \"Mother's visitation has remained at the highest level of\n\nsupervision throughout this case.\"\n\n       {\u00b655} In its consideration of R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), the juvenile court noted that it\n\nhad not conducted an in camera interview with Jo.M. and Ja.M., who were seven years old\n\nat the time of the permanent custody hearing. However, the court had considered the report\n\nof the children's guardian ad litem, who recommended that permanent custody be granted\n\nto the Agency.\n\n       {\u00b656} The court then considered the custodial history of the children, as required by\n\nR.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(c). The court noted that the children had been removed from Mother's\n\ncustody for more than 26 months by the time of the permanent custody hearing. When\n\nremoved from Mother's care on November 6, 2018, Jo.M. and Ja.M. were placed with\n\nnonrelative caregivers. The nonrelative caregivers were granted temporary custody of the\n\nchildren on January 17, 2019. Jo.M. and Ja.M. remained in the temporary custody of the\n\nnonrelative caregivers until July 30, 2019, when they were then placed in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody. At the time the Agency moved for permanent custody of the children,\n\nthey had been in the Agency's custody for 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nBy the time of the permanent custody hearing, Jo.M. and Ja.M. had been in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody for 19 months.\n\n\n                                             - 21 -\n\f                                                                        Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                               CA2021-06-073\n                                                                               CA2021-07-083\n                                                                               CA2021-07-084\n\n       {\u00b657} In considering R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(d), the juvenile court found that the\n\nchildren were in need of legally secure placement and that their need for such placement\n\ncould not be obtained without a grant of permanent custody to the Agency. The court\n\ndiscussed Mother's limited progress in meeting case plan services, her failure to address\n\nthe substance abuse issues that initially led to the children's removal, and her continued\n\ninvolvement with her boyfriend, someone that the court determined \"remain[ed] a significant\n\nsource of concern.\" The juvenile court stated, in relevant part, that\n\n              Mother has not successfully engaged in substance abuse and\n              mental health services. * * * She has not complied with random\n              drug screens. She has been transient for much of this case,\n              and not held stable employment. Her visitations with the\n              children were ultimately suspended, and she has failed to meet\n              the criteria to have them reinstated due to lack of compliance\n              with treatment. She continues to reside with her paramour who\n              also has substance abuse issues, and he has refused to comply\n              with treatment and screening.\n\n       {\u00b658} Furthermore, the court noted that more than two years after the children's\n\nremoval from Mother's custody, \"Mother continue[d] to lack insight into the reasons for the\n\nchild[ren]'s removal or the importance of making changes to remedy the conditions for the\n\nremoval.\"\n\n       {\u00b659} The juvenile court further stated that despite efforts by the Agency, no\n\nappropriate relatives or nonrelatives were found for placement of the children. The court\n\nnoted that several home study assessments had been initiated but were \"ultimately\n\nwithdrawn after the families either failed to follow through or were withdrawn.\" No other\n\nappropriate relatives or nonrelatives had filed a motion for legal custody of the children as\n\nan alternative to the permanent custody motion.\n\n       {\u00b660} As it pertained to Mother, the court found that the factors set forth in R.C.\n\n\n                                            - 22 -\n\f                                                                            Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                   CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                   CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                   CA2021-07-084\n\n2151.414(E)(7) to (11) did not apply.6\n\n       {\u00b661} Based on its consideration of all relevant factors in accordance with R.C.\n\n2151.414(D), the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in Jo.M.'s\n\nand Ja.M.'s best interest to grant permanent custody to the Agency.\n\n       {\u00b662} Mother disputes the juvenile court's findings and argues that the evidence\n\ndoes not support the grant of permanent custody. Mother asserts that she has made\n\nsignificant progress towards her case plan, \"complet[ing] all case plan services except for\n\none in home parenting class,\" and argues that the reasons the children were removed from\n\nher home are no longer an issue. Mother contends she is \"clean and sober,\" employed full-\n\ntime, and has a \"two-bedroom home that is safe and appropriate\" for the children.\n\n       {\u00b663} As an initial matter, we note that \"the completion of case plan services alone\n\ndoes not equate to, or necessitate, a finding that the parents have substantially remedied\n\nthe conditions that caused the removal of the child from the home.\" In re R.K., 12th Dist.\n\nWarren Nos. CA2021-03-027 and CA2021-03-028, 2021-Ohio-3074, \u00b6 24, citing In re S.M.,\n\n12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2015-01-003, 2015-Ohio-2318, \u00b6 24.                     \"[A] parent can\n\nsuccessfully complete the requirements of a case plan, but not substantially remedy the\n\nconditions that caused the children to be removed, as the case plan is 'simply a means to\n\na goal, but not the goal itself.'\" Id., quoting In re E.B., 12th Dist.

While Mother has made\n\nsome progress towards her case plan goals, Mother has failed to address the substance\n\n\n6. Father was found to have abandoned the children. R.C. 2151.414(E)(10).\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nabuse and mental health issues that led to the children's removal in November 2018. As of\n\nthe date of the permanent custody hearing, Mother had not successfully completed a mental\n\nhealth or substance abuse treatment program.        In fact, she had been unsuccessfully\n\ndischarged from two treatment facilities and was merely in the process of reengaging one\n\nof those facilities for treatment.   Though Mother had filled out paperwork at Access\n\nCounseling, she had not restarted treatment.\n\n        {\u00b665} Furthermore, while Mother passed two drug screens administered at the\n\nbeginning of March 2021, Mother had not demonstrated her ability to remain sober for any\n\nsignificant period of time.   Excluding the March 2021 negative screens, Mother's last\n\nnegative screen for the Agency was in December 2019.\n\n        {\u00b666} Mother's failure to make progress on her substance abuse and mental health\n\ntreatment prevented the Agency from making a referral for in-home parenting classes. Her\n\nfailure to reengage in mental health and substance abuse treatment also prevented Mother\n\nfrom having her visitation reinstated after it was suspended by the court on December 17,\n\n2020.\n\n        {\u00b667} Mother's housing and employment were also very new and did not\n\ndemonstrate a period of stability. While Mother's housing had been deemed appropriate\n\nby the Agency, she had only resided in the home for approximately two months as of the\n\ndate of the permanent custody hearing. Prior to that date, Mother spent different periods\n\nof time incarcerated, living with various family members, living at a campground, and living\n\nin a studio apartment. Mother also continued to reside with her longtime boyfriend, an\n\nindividual who had been in and out of jail on various drug-related offenses. Mother admitted\n\nthat her boyfriend struggled with drug abuse and was not engaged in treatment for his\n\n\n                                           - 24 -\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nsubstance abuse issues.\n\n       {\u00b668} As for her employment, Mother had started a new job only a few days before\n\nthe permanent custody hearing. This job required Mother to work from 4:00 p.m. until 2:00\n\na.m. Mother did not have any real plans on how she would arrange for childcare during her\n\nwork hours. She simply hoped that she would be able to change her shift.\n\n       {\u00b669} In addition to not making progress on the majority of her case plan goals, the\n\nrecord reflects that Mother does not recognize why the children were removed from her\n\ncustody or the need for changes to her lifestyle in order to ensure the health, safety, and\n\nstability of the children. When asked about her personal habits and what in particular she\n\nwould do differently if she regained custody of the children, Mother stated, \"Umm\u2026I don't,\n\nI don't really know because I don't know exactly what I have [done].\" Mother did not see a\n\nproblem with continuing to reside with her drug-using boyfriend. Despite acknowledging\n\nthat she and her boyfriend went on \"drug binges\" together, where they not only used illegal\n\nsubstances but also committed crimes by writing \"bad checks,\" Mother believed it would be\n\nappropriate to have the children around her boyfriend as her boyfriend was the only father\n\nfigure Jo.M. and Ja.M. had ever known. Mother also thought it was appropriate, on her own\n\naccord, to stop taking the medication prescribed to her for her bipolar disorder, anxiety, and\n\ndepression. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, we agree with the juvenile\n\ncourt that Mother's statements and actions demonstrate her lack of insight and\n\nunwillingness to create a safe and stable environment for Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\n       {\u00b670} In contrast, the record shows that the children have gained safety and stability\n\nwhile in the Agency's custody. Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been placed with the same foster\n\nfamily since the end of July 2019. By all accounts, the children are doing well in the\n\n\n                                            - 25 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nplacement and are bonded to their foster family. The foster parents indicated a desire to\n\nadopt the children.\n\n      {\u00b671} As this court has previously recognized, \"'[a] child's best interests are served\n\nby the child being placed in a permanent situation that fosters growth, stability, and\n\nsecurity.'\" In re D.E., 2018-Ohio-3341 at \u00b6 60, quoting In re Keaton, 4th Dist. Ross Nos.\n\n04CA2785 and 04CA2788, 2014-Ohio-6210, \u00b6 61. The juvenile court's decision does just\n\nthat. Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been removed from Mother's care since November 6, 2018.\n\nDespite diligent and reasonable efforts by the Agency, Mother has been unable to remedy\n\nthe conditions that caused the children's removal. The children are in need of legally secure\n\npermanent placement, and it is in their best interest for permanent custody to be awarded\n\nto the Agency. Therefore, in light of the foregoing considerations, we find that the juvenile\n\ncourt's decision to grant permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M. to the Agency was\n\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence. Mother's second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n      {\u00b672} Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n      PIPER, P.J., and M.

For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we affirm the juvenile court's decision.\n\n        {\u00b62}    Ja.M. and Jo.M., twin boys born on October 15, 2013, resided with Mother\n\nuntil being removed from her care on November 6, 2018.1 On that date, police responded\n\nto a home where Mother, her boyfriend, Ja.M., Jo.M., and one of Mother's cousins were\n\nstaying. Officers found Jo.M. had been left alone with Mother's cousin, who had overdosed\n\nwhile Jo.M. was present. Officers found drugs, needles, and other drug paraphernalia\n\nwithin reach of the children, including in Mother's and her boyfriend's bedroom. Mother was\n\nsubsequently arrested and charged with child endangerment and Jo.M. and Ja.M were\n\nplaced in the care of nonrelatives pursuant to a voluntary safety plan.\n\n        {\u00b63}    On January 17, 2019, BCDJFS filed a complaint alleging Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\nwere dependent children. In support of its complaint, the Agency referenced the November\n\n6, 2018 incident and Mother's arrest and noted that Mother was incarcerated and had an\n\nanticipated release date of April 4, 2019. The complaint sought to keep Ja.M. and Jo.M. in\n\nthe care of the nonrelatives who had been caring for the boys.\n\n        {\u00b64}    After receiving the Agency's complaint, the juvenile court granted emergency\n\ntemporary custody to the nonrelatives caring for the children. The juvenile court also\n\nappointed a guardian ad litem for Jo.M. and Ja.M. Mother was granted visitation with the\n\nchildren, to be supervised by the nonrelative caregivers.\n\n        {\u00b65}    On March 6, 2019, Jo.M. and Ja.M. were adjudicated dependent following a\n\nstipulation by Mother. Mother waived a bifurcated hearing and the juvenile court entered a\n\n\n\n\n1. Jo.M.'s and Ja.M.'s biological father has not been involved in the boys' lives. He did not participate in any\ncase plan services, did not appear at the permanent custody hearing, and is not a party to the present appeal.\n\n                                                     -2-\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\ndispositional order placing the children in the continued temporary custody of the\n\nnonrelatives who had been caring for them. At this time, the court adopted a case plan for\n\nMother's reunification with the children. The case plan required Mother to complete a\n\nsubstance abuse and mental illness (\"SAMI\") assessment and to follow through with any\n\nrecommended treatments as a result of that assessment, including attending outpatient\n\ndrug and alcohol treatment, attending mental health counseling, and obtaining a psychiatric\n\nevaluation for medication management. Mother was also required to complete random drug\n\nscreens, maintain stable housing and income, and participate in an in-home parenting\n\neducation program. Mother's longtime boyfriend, who resided with Mother and wished to\n\nbe involved in the children's lives, was also required to complete a SAMI assessment and\n\nfollow through with any recommendations.          The court continued Mother's supervised\n\nvisitation with the children but ordered that the visitations be supervised through the Family\n\nHealing Center.\n\n          {\u00b66}   On July 30, 2019, the Agency filed an emergency motion for change in\n\ntemporary custody.        The Agency sought temporary custody of the children as the\n\nnonrelatives were no longer able to care for Jo.M. and Ja.M. That same date, the juvenile\n\ncourt granted the Agency's motion and the children were placed in the care of a foster\n\nfamily.\n\n          {\u00b67}   Mother made limited progress on her case plan, failing to consistently attend\n\ncounseling, to take or pass drug screens, to maintain stable housing and income, or to\n\nroutinely attend visitation with the children. As a result, on August 3, 2020, the Agency\n\nmoved for permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\n          {\u00b68}   A hearing on the motion was scheduled for December 17, 2020.

The juvenile court denied Mother's motion for\n\ncontinuance, noting that the court had imposed strict COVID-19 safety protocols in the\n\ncourtroom and that Mother had the option of participating in the proceedings remotely.\n\n        {\u00b69}    On December 15, 2020, the children's guardian ad litem filed a report\n\nrecommending that permanent custody be granted to the Agency. The guardian ad litem\n\nnoted that since the children had been removed from Mother's care in November 2018,\n\nMother had failed to consistently visit with the children or make any real progress on the\n\ncase plan. The guardian ad litem believed granting permanent custody to the Agency was\n\n\"in the best interests of the children and their only option for permanency.\"\n\n        {\u00b610} At the commencement of the December 17, 2020 permanent custody hearing,\n\nMother's counsel orally moved for a continuance of the proceedings on the grounds that\n\nMother was ill and unable to participate due to COVID-19 exposure. Though the Agency\n\nand the children's guardian ad litem opposed continuing the matter, arguing Mother was\n\nmerely seeking to delay proceedings, the court granted a three-month continuance.\n\n        {\u00b611} On March 25, 2021, a permanent custody hearing was held before a juvenile\n\ncourt magistrate. The magistrate heard testimony from the supervisor who oversaw Jo.M.'s\n\nand Ja.M.'s case with the Agency, the children's foster mother, Mother, and one of Mother's\n\nfriends.2\n\n\n\n2. Mother appeared 45 minutes late at the March 25, 2021 permanent custody hearing. Mother's counsel,\nhowever, appeared timely and represented Mother's interests in her absence. Mother was permitted to testify\nat the hearing upon her arrival.\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f                                                                   Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                          CA2021-06-073\n                                                                          CA2021-07-083\n                                                                          CA2021-07-084\n\n      {\u00b612} The supervisor discussed the Agency's history with Mother, noting that\n\nBCDJFS had been involved since November 6, 2018, when Jo.M. had been left alone with\n\na cousin who overdosed while caring for the child. As drugs and drug paraphernalia,\n\nincluding mirrors coated with white residue and needles, were found in the home, the\n\nchildren were removed and placed in the custody of nonrelatives. The children remained\n\nin the nonrelatives care until July 30, 2019, when they were placed in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody. The children have been placed in the same foster family's home since\n\nJuly 30, 2019 and are doing well in that foster placement.\n\n      {\u00b613} The supervisor noted that though a case plan for reunification had been\n\ndeveloped in February 2019 and adopted by the juvenile court in March 2019, Mother had\n\nmade limited progress on her case plan. Mother completed a SAMI assessment and was\n\ndiagnosed with substance abuse issues, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. It was\n\nrecommended that she obtain drug and alcohol treatment, mental health counseling, and a\n\npsychiatric evaluation to manage her medication, as well as attend an employment success\n\nprogram and an in-home parenting education program. Mother \"declined\" to attend the\n\nemployment program. She did engage in counseling at Access Counseling in Middletown,\n\nOhio in March 2019. However, her attendance was sporadic and she frequently refused to\n\nsubmit to drug screens. Mother was unsuccessfully discharged from Access Counseling in\n\nMay 2019.\n\n      {\u00b614} Mother did not attend any other counseling services until August 2020, when\n\nshe was referred to The Next Right Thing.        After obtaining an evaluation and being\n\ndiagnosed with an amphetamine-type substance use disorder, Mother began outpatient\n\ntreatment and counseling. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother's appointments were\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                                                                   Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                          CA2021-06-073\n                                                                          CA2021-07-083\n                                                                          CA2021-07-084\n\nheld virtually or by telephone.    For a couple of months, Mother regularly attended\n\ncounseling, though she refused to complete drug screens when requested by The Next\n\nRight Thing. By November 2020, Mother had begun missing counseling sessions. The last\n\nsession she attended before being unsuccessfully discharged from the program was on\n\nNovember 24, 2020. When discharged, it was recommended that Mother obtain further\n\noutpatient substance abuse treatment and mental health services.\n\n      {\u00b615} Mother did not seek additional treatment until a few weeks before the\n\npermanent custody hearing. In March 2021, Mother was once again referred to Access\n\nCounseling for treatment. However, because it had been years since Mother's last SAMI\n\nassessment, Access Counseling required a new assessment before treatment could begin.\n\nAlthough Mother had completed paperwork with Access Counseling, she had not\n\nundergone the assessment or started treatment as of the date of the permanent custody\n\nhearing.\n\n      {\u00b616} The Agency supervisor discussed the difficulty she had in getting Mother to\n\ncomply with random drug screens. Mother frequently refused or failed to show up for drug\n\nscreens requested by the Agency, Access Counseling, or The Next Right Thing. When\n\nMother did comply with screenings, the majority of her screens came back positive. More\n\nthan a dozen times, Mother tested positive for either methamphetamines, amphetamines,\n\nbenzodiazepines, alcohol, or some combination of those substances.         However, in\n\nDecember 2019, Mother had three negative screens. Mother also had two negative drug\n\nscreens in the first week of March 2021.\n\n      {\u00b617} Mother struggled to maintain stable housing during the pendency of the case.\n\nMother was incarcerated multiple times, spending approximately 30 days in the Middletown\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                                                                Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                       CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                       CA2021-07-084\n\njail and 80 to 90 days in the Butler County jail for various offenses, including child\n\nendangerment, forgery, identity theft, and an attempt offense.3 When she was not in jail,\n\nMother and her longtime boyfriend moved between the homes of several family members.\n\nMother acknowledged to the Agency that living with relatives was not ideal or \"a good\n\nsituation.\" Nonetheless, after moving out of the home they shared with the cousin who\n\noverdosed, Mother and her boyfriend moved in with Mother's uncle for about 18 months in\n\n2019 and 2020. Mother and her boyfriend then moved in with the children's maternal\n\ngrandmother and great-grandmother in Kentucky for about four or five months. In August\n\nor October 2020, Mother and her boyfriend moved to Centerville, where they rented a studio\n\napartment for three months. Mother and her boyfriend then bought a camper and moved\n\ninto a campground in Carmody for a couple of months. In mid-January 2021, Mother and\n\nher boyfriend rented a two-bedroom townhome in Franklin. The second bedroom was\n\nintended for Jo.M. and Ja.M. The Agency visited the townhome and did not observe any\n\nsafety issues or hazards. However, the supervisor still had concerns about the stability of\n\nMother's housing, noting the brief period of time Mother had been in the townhome.\n\nMother's unstable housing, in combination with her lack of progress in her substance abuse\n\ntreatment, prevented the Agency from making a referral for in-home parenting classes.\n\n        {\u00b618} The supervisor expressed concern over Mother's employment history. The\n\nsupervisor noted Mother had reported working inconsistently throughout the pendency of\n\nthe case. The week of the permanent custody hearing, Mother obtained employment with\n\na Walmart distribution center. However, as Mother had only started the position two days\n\n\n\n\n3 The specifics of Mother's \"attempt\" offense were not discussed at the permanent custody hearing or within\nthe exhibits admitted into evidence.\n\n                                                   -7-\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\nbefore the permanent custody hearing began, this was not long enough for Mother to have\n\nachieved stability in her employment.\n\n       {\u00b619} Mother's relationship with her longtime boyfriend and his lack of involvement\n\nin the case plan was also concerning to the supervisor. Mother's boyfriend has a criminal\n\nhistory involving illegal substances.    He was arrested and charged with drug abuse\n\n(methamphetamines) in February 2019. In March 2019, Mother's boyfriend was again\n\narrested and charged with methamphetamine-related crimes and tampering with records.\n\nAlthough Mother's boyfriend admitted to the police he had a drug abuse problem, he denied\n\nhaving any substance abuse issues when asked by the Agency. Mother's boyfriend was\n\ndiagnosed with an amphetamine use disorder and briefly attended counseling at The Next\n\nRight Thing. However, near the end of 2020, after failing to attend counseling for more than\n\ntwo months, he was unsuccessfully discharged. Mother's boyfriend has not reengaged in\n\nany treatment or counseling services and has refused to submit to any drug screens.\n\n       {\u00b620} The supervisor noted that since the children were removed from Mother's care\n\nin November 2018, Mother's visitation with the children had never progressed beyond\n\nsupervised visitation. Visitation originally occurred in the home of the nonrelative caregivers\n\nbefore being moved to the Family Healing Center.           Once the Agency was awarded\n\ntemporary custody, visitation continued at the Family Healing Center. Mother's visitation\n\nremained at the \"most restricted\" supervision level, which required Mother to have a\n\nsupervisor overseeing the visit \"within eye contact, ear contact, right next to them.\"\n\n       {\u00b621} Mother did not consistently exercise visitation with the children. On May 24\n\n2019, after Mother missed multiple consecutive visits without calling to cancel, Mother was\n\nremoved from the visitation schedule. Mother was added back to the visitation schedule in\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nAugust 2019. In October 2019, Mother's visitation was again suspended after she failed to\n\nattend consecutive visitations. Visits resumed on November 13, 2019 after Mother met with\n\nthe director of the visitation center.\n\n        {\u00b622} Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother's visitations were moved to\n\nvirtual visitations.   The Family Healing Center continued to supervise the visits over\n\nFaceTime.     Mother often cut the virtual visitations short, and the visitation supervisor\n\nreported that Mother had minimal communication during the virtual visits and needed\n\nguidance on how to engage the children. As of May 2020, Mother started missing visitations\n\nwith some frequency, including missed visitations in the months of August 2020, October\n\n2020, and November 2020. On December 17, 2020, the juvenile court suspended Mother's\n\nvisitation until Mother submitted two consecutive negative drug screens and reengaged in\n\nmental health and substance abuse treatment. As of the date of the permanent custody\n\nhearing, Mother had not complied with the latter of those requirements and her visitation\n\nhad not been reinstated.\n\n        {\u00b623} Foster Mother testified Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been in her and her husband's\n\ncare since the end of July 2019, and they have an interest in adopting the boys. Jo.M. and\n\nJa.M. are bonded to their foster parents and their foster parents' two children. Jo.M. and\n\nJa.M. are in first grade and are doing well in school. Both boys attend counseling on a\n\nweekly or biweekly basis depending on their counselor's availability. The boys enjoy playing\n\nbasketball, riding bikes, trampolining, and spending time on the foster family's small hobby\n\nfarm.\n\n        {\u00b624} Foster Mother testified about Jo.M. and Ja.M.'s visitations with Mother, noting\n\nthat since the visitations moved online, Mother has missed a number of the visits. In the\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nFall of 2020, Mother missed four consecutive visits. When Mother did appear for the\n\nvisitations, she did not appear engaged and often ended the calls early. Foster Mother\n\nrecalled that on the boys' birthday, Mother appeared 12 minutes late and ended the visit\n\nafter three minutes with the boys. Foster Mother acknowledged that given the boys' young\n\nage, they sometimes had difficulty staying focused and engaged during the video calls.\n\nHowever, Foster Mother noted that other relatives who had video calls with Jo.M. and Ja.M.,\n\nincluding maternal grandmother and an older sibling, were able to engage with the children.\n\n       {\u00b625} Mother testified that she and the children are bonded. Mother claimed that\n\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic, she routinely visited with the children, missing only a few\n\nvisits. Mother brought Jo.M. and Ja.M. lunch and they played games and did art and crafts\n\nprojects together. Once visitations were made virtual, Mother testified the visits became\n\n\"torture\" and were \"heartbreaking.\" Mother claimed the boys did not like to be on the phone\n\nand would get bored, necessitating an early end to the visitations. Mother also testified that\n\nthere were times the foster family's schedule resulted in a missed visitation and, with the\n\nexception of one occurrence, the missed visitations were not made up.\n\n       {\u00b626} Mother stated she was making progress on her case plan, noting that\n\ntransportation problems hindered her ability to attend counseling and substance abuse\n\nmeetings earlier in the case. However, Mother obtained a vehicle in July 2020. She has\n\nsince sought to restart substance abuse and mental health services at Access Counseling.\n\nIn addition to transportation difficulties, Mother explained she had stopped attending\n\nservices at Access Counseling in 2019 because she was upset her counselor reported\n\ncertain information to the Agency against her wishes.\n\n       {\u00b627} Mother testified that she now lives in housing suitable for caring for Jo.M. and\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nJa.M. She has also recently started a new job with Walmart, one that has her working from\n\n4:00 p.m. until 2:00 a.m. When questioned about what she would do for childcare if she\n\nregained custody of the children, Mother indicated she would \"try to change shifts.\"\n\n      {\u00b628} Mother admitted that since the Agency's involvement, both she and her\n\nboyfriend spent periods of time in jail for various criminal offenses. She further admitted\n\nthat both she and her boyfriend have struggled on and off with drug abuse. She claimed\n\nthat she did not miss as many drug screens as the Agency suggested, stating that she had\n\nbeen screened while she was on probation. According to Mother, her drug screens through\n\nthe probation department were negative for illegal substances. This led Mother to believe\n\nthat the results of the drug screens administered by the Agency, which often came back\n\npositive for methamphetamine and amphetamines, were \"not correct.\"\n\n      {\u00b629} Mother also testified that she had been prescribed trazadone, latuda, and\n\nvalium as a result of her 2016 diagnoses for bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression.\n\nMother, on her own initiative, stopped taking the prescribed medication because \"taking\n\nmind-altering drugs does not help.\" Mother also testified that she was diagnosed with\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder and obtained a marijuana prescription card, though the\n\nprescription card was not provided to the Agency or presented as evidence.\n\n      {\u00b630} Mother's friend testified that she and Mother have been friends since they\n\nwere in second grade. Mother's friend testified that Mother was loving and very bonded to\n\nJo.M. and Ja.M. Though Mother could be \"a little lenient\" with the children, the friend never\n\nobserved any behavior that caused her to be concerned with Mother's ability to parent the\n\nchildren. However, on cross-examination, the friend admitted she had not been aware of\n\nMother's substance abuse problems and had not observed Mother interact with the children\n\n\n                                           - 11 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nsince before the children were removed from Mother's care in November 2018.\n\n       {\u00b631} After considering the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, the\n\nmagistrate issued a decision granting the Agency permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\nThe magistrate found that it was in the children's best interest for permanent custody to be\n\nawarded, that the children had been in the temporary custody of the Agency for at least 12\n\nmonths of a consecutive 22-month period, and that despite reasonable efforts by the\n\nAgency to prevent the need for placement of the children outside the home, the children\n\ncould not and should not be placed with their mother or father within a reasonable amount\n\nof time.\n\n       {\u00b632} Mother filed timely objections to the magistrate's decision, arguing that it was\n\nnot in the children's best interest for permanent custody to be granted to the Agency, that\n\nthe magistrate's decision was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, and that the\n\nsufficiency and weight of the evidence supported Mother regaining legal custody of the\n\nchildren. On May 25, 2021, the juvenile court held a hearing on Mother's objections.\n\nFollowing the hearing, on June 6, 2021, the juvenile court overruled Mother's objections\n\nand adopted the magistrate's decision in full.\n\n       {\u00b633} Mother now appeals the juvenile court's decision, raising two assignments of\n\nerror for review.\n\n       {\u00b634} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n       {\u00b635} [MOTHER]       WAS      DENIED      THE     ABILITY     AND     REASONABLE\n\nOPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY WITH H[ER] CHILDREN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND\n\nTHE TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE H[ER] CASE PLAN AND REUNIFY SHOULD HAVE\n\nBEEN EXTENDED BY AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS BEFORE PERMANENT\n\n\n                                           - 12 -\n\f                                                                       Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                              CA2021-06-073\n                                                                              CA2021-07-083\n                                                                              CA2021-07-084\n\nCUSTODY WAS CONSIDERED.\n\n       {\u00b636} In her first assignment of error, Mother argues she was denied a reasonable\n\nopportunity to reunify with the children due to the COVID-19 pandemic and contends the\n\njuvenile court should have granted her an additional six months to continue to make\n\nprogress on her case plan before considering the Agency's motion for permanent custody.\n\nMother argues that her \"ability to visit her children and to complete [case plan] services was\n\nput on hold for over 6 months due to the global pandemic\" and, citing health orders issued\n\nby the Governor of Ohio, tolling orders issued by the Ohio Supreme Court, and the federal\n\neviction moratorium, argues that a similar delay in permanent custody proceedings should\n\nhave applied.\n\n       {\u00b637} We note, however, that Mother never moved the juvenile court to extend\n\ntemporary custody or continue the permanent custody proceedings on the grounds that the\n\npandemic impeded her ability to reunify with the children. Instead, Mother asked for a\n\ncontinuance of the permanent custody hearing because she feared being exposed to\n\nCOVID-19 while in the courtroom. Furthermore, when objecting to the magistrate's decision\n\ngranting permanent custody to the Agency, Mother did not raise the issue of a sixth-month\n\nextension of the Agency's temporary custody in order to allow her additional time to\n\ncomplete case plan goals.\n\n       {\u00b638} It is well-settled that issues not raised in the trial court may not ordinarily be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal.

The record reveals that COVID-19 pandemic restrictions did not prevent Mother\n\nfrom accessing case plan services or otherwise preclude her from abstaining from drug use\n\nor other illegal activity, prevent her from attending online or telehealth services to address\n\n\n                                            - 14 -\n\f                                                                               Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                      CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                      CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                      CA2021-07-084\n\nher substance abuse and mental health issues, or stop her from attending virtual visitations\n\nwith the children. Mother's failure to complete case plan services and reunify with Jo.M.\n\nand Ja.M. were based on Mother's actions, not the limitations presented by the COVID-19\n\npandemic.\n\n       {\u00b641} Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mother failed to make progress on case\n\nplan objectives. The case plan was adopted by the juvenile court on March 6, 2019, a full\n\nyear before the pandemic began in March 2020.4 During this time, Mother was in and out\n\nof jail, failed to establish stable housing and employment, failed to routinely visit with the\n\nchildren, resulting in her visitations being suspended in May 2019 and October 2019, and\n\ncontinued to use illegal substances and test positive for methamphetamines,\n\namphetamines, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or a combination of those substances. Mother\n\nalso failed to regularly attend substance abuse and mental health treatments. Although\n\nMother started treatment at Access Counseling in March 2019, she was unsuccessfully\n\ndischarged from the program in May 2019. She did not reengage in services for more than\n\na year, waiting until August 2020 to begin treatment at The Next Right Thing.\n\n       {\u00b642} Once the COVID-19 pandemic began and safety precautions were put into\n\nplace, Mother was given the opportunity to continue case plan services remotely. She\n\nbriefly reengaged in outpatient substance abuse and mental health treatment with The Next\n\nRight Thing in August 2020 by means of telehealth and virtual appointments. However, by\n\nthe end of November 2020, Mother stopped attending counseling sessions and she was\n\nsubsequently discharged from the facility. The Agency requested drug screens from Mother\n\n\n\n4. The Governor of Ohio issued Executive Order 2020-01D declaring a state of emergency in Ohio in response\nto COVID-19 on March 9, 2020. A national emergency was declared by the President of the United States\non March 13, 2020. See In re L.H., 5th Dist.

Mother was given the opportunity to continue visitations with the children using\n\nvideo phone calls, but she frequently missed the visitations or cut short the visitations after\n\nfailing to engage with the children. After Mother's visitation was suspended on December\n\n12, 2020 by the juvenile court, she failed to satisfy the requisite conditions to have visitation\n\nreinstated.\n\n       {\u00b643} Though Mother complains that \"many services were not available during the\n\npandemic,\" the only service that Mother specifically identifies as being \"not offered\" during\n\nthe pandemic was in-home parenting classes.            However, as the Agency supervisor\n\nexplained, the Agency did not refer the parenting classes in accordance with its policy that\n\nin-home parenting classes are not offered until the parent has obtained stable housing and\n\nmade progress with drug treatment. As Mother had only recently moved into her townhouse\n\nand she had not progressed in her substance abuse treatment as of the date of the\n\npermanent custody hearing, it was Mother's lack of case progress, and not the pandemic,\n\nthat prevented Mother from receiving a referral from the Agency for in-home parenting\n\nclasses.\n\n       {\u00b644} The record therefore demonstrates that Mother's failure to complete case plan\n\nservices was not the result of the limitations or restrictions presented by the COVID-19\n\npandemic but, rather, her own actions. As such, we find no merit to Mother's arguments\n\nthat the juvenile court erred by not sua sponte ordering a six-month extension of temporary\n\ncustody to allow her additional time to make progress on her case plan due to the COVID-\n\n19 pandemic.

While in the foster family's\n\ncare, the children have had video calls with their maternal grandmother and an older sister,\n\nbut the court found that \"[t]he strength of any bond with [these] relatives [was] not able to\n\nbe determined.\"\n\n       {\u00b654} As for the children's relationship with Mother, the court noted Mother had\n\nindicated she and the children were bonded. However, the court found that Mother had\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\f                                                                        Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                               CA2021-06-073\n                                                                               CA2021-07-083\n                                                                               CA2021-07-084\n\ndifficulty maintaining visitation with the children throughout the pendency of the case, with\n\nher visitations being suspended on multiple occasions and the \"quality of her visitation\n\n[being] inconsistent over time.\" The court discussed the difficulty Mother had in engaging\n\nthe children during virtual visitations and found that \"[t]owards the end of the visitations that\n\ntook place, most of the observations of bonding [between Mother and the children] were\n\nnoted as poor.\" Furthermore, \"Mother's visitation has remained at the highest level of\n\nsupervision throughout this case.\"\n\n       {\u00b655} In its consideration of R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), the juvenile court noted that it\n\nhad not conducted an in camera interview with Jo.M. and Ja.M., who were seven years old\n\nat the time of the permanent custody hearing. However, the court had considered the report\n\nof the children's guardian ad litem, who recommended that permanent custody be granted\n\nto the Agency.\n\n       {\u00b656} The court then considered the custodial history of the children, as required by\n\nR.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(c). The court noted that the children had been removed from Mother's\n\ncustody for more than 26 months by the time of the permanent custody hearing. When\n\nremoved from Mother's care on November 6, 2018, Jo.M. and Ja.M. were placed with\n\nnonrelative caregivers. The nonrelative caregivers were granted temporary custody of the\n\nchildren on January 17, 2019. Jo.M. and Ja.M. remained in the temporary custody of the\n\nnonrelative caregivers until July 30, 2019, when they were then placed in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody. At the time the Agency moved for permanent custody of the children,\n\nthey had been in the Agency's custody for 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nBy the time of the permanent custody hearing, Jo.M. and Ja.M. had been in the Agency's\n\ntemporary custody for 19 months.\n\n\n                                             - 21 -\n\f                                                                        Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                               CA2021-06-073\n                                                                               CA2021-07-083\n                                                                               CA2021-07-084\n\n       {\u00b657} In considering R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(d), the juvenile court found that the\n\nchildren were in need of legally secure placement and that their need for such placement\n\ncould not be obtained without a grant of permanent custody to the Agency. The court\n\ndiscussed Mother's limited progress in meeting case plan services, her failure to address\n\nthe substance abuse issues that initially led to the children's removal, and her continued\n\ninvolvement with her boyfriend, someone that the court determined \"remain[ed] a significant\n\nsource of concern.\" The juvenile court stated, in relevant part, that\n\n              Mother has not successfully engaged in substance abuse and\n              mental health services. * * * She has not complied with random\n              drug screens. She has been transient for much of this case,\n              and not held stable employment. Her visitations with the\n              children were ultimately suspended, and she has failed to meet\n              the criteria to have them reinstated due to lack of compliance\n              with treatment. She continues to reside with her paramour who\n              also has substance abuse issues, and he has refused to comply\n              with treatment and screening.\n\n       {\u00b658} Furthermore, the court noted that more than two years after the children's\n\nremoval from Mother's custody, \"Mother continue[d] to lack insight into the reasons for the\n\nchild[ren]'s removal or the importance of making changes to remedy the conditions for the\n\nremoval.\"\n\n       {\u00b659} The juvenile court further stated that despite efforts by the Agency, no\n\nappropriate relatives or nonrelatives were found for placement of the children. The court\n\nnoted that several home study assessments had been initiated but were \"ultimately\n\nwithdrawn after the families either failed to follow through or were withdrawn.\" No other\n\nappropriate relatives or nonrelatives had filed a motion for legal custody of the children as\n\nan alternative to the permanent custody motion.\n\n       {\u00b660} As it pertained to Mother, the court found that the factors set forth in R.C.\n\n\n                                            - 22 -\n\f                                                                            Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                                   CA2021-06-073\n                                                                                   CA2021-07-083\n                                                                                   CA2021-07-084\n\n2151.414(E)(7) to (11) did not apply.6\n\n       {\u00b661} Based on its consideration of all relevant factors in accordance with R.C.\n\n2151.414(D), the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in Jo.M.'s\n\nand Ja.M.'s best interest to grant permanent custody to the Agency.\n\n       {\u00b662} Mother disputes the juvenile court's findings and argues that the evidence\n\ndoes not support the grant of permanent custody. Mother asserts that she has made\n\nsignificant progress towards her case plan, \"complet[ing] all case plan services except for\n\none in home parenting class,\" and argues that the reasons the children were removed from\n\nher home are no longer an issue. Mother contends she is \"clean and sober,\" employed full-\n\ntime, and has a \"two-bedroom home that is safe and appropriate\" for the children.\n\n       {\u00b663} As an initial matter, we note that \"the completion of case plan services alone\n\ndoes not equate to, or necessitate, a finding that the parents have substantially remedied\n\nthe conditions that caused the removal of the child from the home.\" In re R.K., 12th Dist.\n\nWarren Nos.

While Mother has made\n\nsome progress towards her case plan goals, Mother has failed to address the substance\n\n\n6. Father was found to have abandoned the children. R.C. 2151.414(E)(10).\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nabuse and mental health issues that led to the children's removal in November 2018. As of\n\nthe date of the permanent custody hearing, Mother had not successfully completed a mental\n\nhealth or substance abuse treatment program.        In fact, she had been unsuccessfully\n\ndischarged from two treatment facilities and was merely in the process of reengaging one\n\nof those facilities for treatment.   Though Mother had filled out paperwork at Access\n\nCounseling, she had not restarted treatment.\n\n        {\u00b665} Furthermore, while Mother passed two drug screens administered at the\n\nbeginning of March 2021, Mother had not demonstrated her ability to remain sober for any\n\nsignificant period of time.   Excluding the March 2021 negative screens, Mother's last\n\nnegative screen for the Agency was in December 2019.\n\n        {\u00b666} Mother's failure to make progress on her substance abuse and mental health\n\ntreatment prevented the Agency from making a referral for in-home parenting classes. Her\n\nfailure to reengage in mental health and substance abuse treatment also prevented Mother\n\nfrom having her visitation reinstated after it was suspended by the court on December 17,\n\n2020.\n\n        {\u00b667} Mother's housing and employment were also very new and did not\n\ndemonstrate a period of stability. While Mother's housing had been deemed appropriate\n\nby the Agency, she had only resided in the home for approximately two months as of the\n\ndate of the permanent custody hearing. Prior to that date, Mother spent different periods\n\nof time incarcerated, living with various family members, living at a campground, and living\n\nin a studio apartment. Mother also continued to reside with her longtime boyfriend, an\n\nindividual who had been in and out of jail on various drug-related offenses. Mother admitted\n\nthat her boyfriend struggled with drug abuse and was not engaged in treatment for his\n\n\n                                           - 24 -\n\f                                                                      Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                             CA2021-06-073\n                                                                             CA2021-07-083\n                                                                             CA2021-07-084\n\nsubstance abuse issues.\n\n       {\u00b668} As for her employment, Mother had started a new job only a few days before\n\nthe permanent custody hearing. This job required Mother to work from 4:00 p.m. until 2:00\n\na.m. Mother did not have any real plans on how she would arrange for childcare during her\n\nwork hours. She simply hoped that she would be able to change her shift.\n\n       {\u00b669} In addition to not making progress on the majority of her case plan goals, the\n\nrecord reflects that Mother does not recognize why the children were removed from her\n\ncustody or the need for changes to her lifestyle in order to ensure the health, safety, and\n\nstability of the children. When asked about her personal habits and what in particular she\n\nwould do differently if she regained custody of the children, Mother stated, \"Umm\u2026I don't,\n\nI don't really know because I don't know exactly what I have [done].\" Mother did not see a\n\nproblem with continuing to reside with her drug-using boyfriend. Despite acknowledging\n\nthat she and her boyfriend went on \"drug binges\" together, where they not only used illegal\n\nsubstances but also committed crimes by writing \"bad checks,\" Mother believed it would be\n\nappropriate to have the children around her boyfriend as her boyfriend was the only father\n\nfigure Jo.M. and Ja.M. had ever known. Mother also thought it was appropriate, on her own\n\naccord, to stop taking the medication prescribed to her for her bipolar disorder, anxiety, and\n\ndepression. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, we agree with the juvenile\n\ncourt that Mother's statements and actions demonstrate her lack of insight and\n\nunwillingness to create a safe and stable environment for Jo.M. and Ja.M.\n\n       {\u00b670} In contrast, the record shows that the children have gained safety and stability\n\nwhile in the Agency's custody. Jo.M. and Ja.M. have been placed with the same foster\n\nfamily since the end of July 2019. By all accounts, the children are doing well in the\n\n\n                                            - 25 -\n\f                                                                     Butler CA2021-06-072\n                                                                            CA2021-06-073\n                                                                            CA2021-07-083\n                                                                            CA2021-07-084\n\nplacement and are bonded to their foster family. The foster parents indicated a desire to\n\nadopt the children.\n\n      {\u00b671} As this court has previously recognized, \"'[a] child's best interests are served\n\nby the child being placed in a permanent situation that fosters growth, stability, and\n\nsecurity.'\" In re D.E., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4305454\"><a href=\"/opinion/4528201/in-re-de/\">2018-Ohio-3341</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at \u00b6 60, quoting In re Keaton, 4th Dist.

Therefore, in light of the foregoing considerations, we find that the juvenile\n\ncourt's decision to grant permanent custody of Jo.M. and Ja.M. to the Agency was\n\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence.

His first claim has merit, his second does not.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                           I\n\n       Michael Thompson suffers from severe mental illness and began using\n\ndrugs regularly as a young teenager. In 2012, Thompson began living in an\n\napartment at Kenyon House, a housing program run by Sound Mental Health for\n\npeople who have been chronically homeless and suffer from both HIV (human\n\nimmunodeficiency virus) or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and\n\nchronic mental illness or substance abuse issues. In January 2014, Thompson\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/2\n\n\nwas sentenced on a conviction of taking a motor vehicle and was ordered to\n\nserve eight months on electronic home monitoring. Thompson was required to\n\nbegin serving this sentence by May 19, 2014. On that day, Thompson attempted\n\nto set up electronic home monitoring at his apartment at Kenyon House but was\n\nunable to do so because the equipment provided was incompatible with the\n\ntelephone line at his residence.\n\n        Thompson became depressed, believing that he would have to go to jail.\n\nHe began drinking alcohol and using drugs and continued to do so around\n\ndifferent areas of downtown Seattle for several days. Eventually, Thompson\n\nencountered an acquaintance, Daryl Ford. Ford and Thompson drank beer\n\ntogether and then went to Thompson\u2019s apartment and used drugs supplied by\n\nFord.\n\n        At trial, Thompson testified that, in the apartment, Ford made sexual\n\nadvances toward him over his verbal objections. According to Thompson\u2019s\n\ntestimony, Ford then repeatedly attempted to sexually assault Thompson and\n\nprevented Thompson from leaving the apartment at knifepoint, telling Thompson,\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t smoking my shit for free.\u201d Ford was \u201cslicing\u201d at Thompson with the\n\nknife, Thompson testified, causing Thompson to retreat to a bathroom in which\n\nhe hit his head against a towel rack, losing consciousness.\n\n        Upon awakening, Thompson found himself on the floor stabbing Ford\u2019s\n\nhand with the knife. Ford was dead. An autopsy later revealed that Ford had 87\n\ninjuries produced by a knife.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/3\n\n\n       Thompson cleaned the apartment and removed the body. He did so by\n\nwrapping Ford\u2019s body in blankets, placing it in a shopping cart, and pushing it\n\ndown the street. A neighbor saw him moving the cart, became suspicious, and\n\ncalled the police. Police officers discovered the body and found Thompson\u2019s\n\nfingerprints on the cart.\n\n       Thompson was arrested at his wife\u2019s home in south King County.1 He was\n\ncharged with murder in the second degree for causing the death of Ford while\n\ncommitting a felony (assault) while armed with a deadly weapon. The\n\ninformation was later amended to add an alternative count of intentional murder\n\nin the second degree while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n       Thompson\u2019s first trial took place in 2017. After 14 days, the judge\n\ndeclared a mistrial because the prosecutor asked Thompson several questions\n\nregarding why he had not told detectives about Ford\u2019s attempted assault, causing\n\nhim to explain several times that he had invoked his right to silence.\n\n       Thompson was tried again in 2019 with new defense counsel. He was\n\nconvicted of felony murder while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n       Thompson appeals.\n\n                                             II\n\n       Thompson contends that the trial court erred by denying him the right to\n\nadvance the defense of insanity. We regard Thompson\u2019s challenge as one to the\n\n\n\n\n       1 Thompson had been living separately from his wife and young children because of his\nserious mental health and substance abuse issues.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/4\n\n\ntrial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, which excluded any evidence of insanity, 2 and we\n\nagree.\n\n         According to Thompson, the trial court\u2019s ruling violated his \u201cright to present\n\na defense.\u201d Our Supreme Court has explained that a contention that an\n\nevidentiary ruling violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional \u201cright to present a defense\u201d\n\nis reviewed pursuant to a two-step process. State v. Arndt, 194 Wn.2d 784, 797-\n\n98, 453 P.3d 696 (2019). First, we review the challenged evidentiary ruling\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. Then, if necessary, we review de novo\n\nwhether the ruling violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a\n\ndefense. See Arndt, 194 Wn.2d at 797-98.\n\n         A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is manifestly\n\nunreasonable or based on untenable grounds or for untenable reasons, such as\n\na misunderstanding of the law. State v. Enriquez-Martinez, ___ Wn.2d ___, 492\n\nP.3d 162, 164 (2021).\n\n         Insanity is a defense that completely absolves a defendant of criminal\n\nliability. State v. Crenshaw, 98 Wn.2d 789, 793, 659 P.2d 488 (1983). It is\n\navailable only to \u201cthose persons who have lost contact with reality so completely\n\nthat they are beyond any of the influences of the criminal law.\u201d State v. White, 60\n\nWn.2d 551, 590, 374 P.2d 942 (1962). Insanity is an affirmative defense that the\n\ndefendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence. RCW\n\n10.77.030(2); State v. Box, 109 Wn.2d 320, 322, 745 P.2d 23 (1987).\n\n\n        2 As evidence of insanity was excluded, there was not evidence of insanity admitted that\n\nwould have entitled Thompson to an insanity instruction. See State v. Fisher, 185 Wn.2d 836,\n848, 374 P.3d 1185 (2016) (a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any theory of the\ncase that is supported by the evidence).\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/5\n\n\nAdditionally, \u201c[b]ecause the law presumes that an individual is sane at the time\n\nthat the individual commits a crime, a defendant asserting the insanity defense\n\nbears the initial burden of producing evidence of insanity.\u201d State v.\n\nChanthabouly, 164 Wn. App. 104, 127-28, 262 P.3d 144 (2011) (citing Box, 109\n\nWn.2d at 322). To establish the defense of insanity, the defendant must show\n\nthat\n\n              (1) [a]t the time of the commission of the offense, as a result\n       of mental disease or defect, the mind of the actor was affected to\n       such an extent that:\n              (a) He or she was unable to perceive the nature and quality\n       of the act with which he or she is charged; or\n              (b) He or she was unable to tell right from wrong with\n       reference to the particular act charged.\n\nRCW 9A.12.010.\n\n       Further, \u201c[n]o condition of mind proximately induced by the voluntary act of\n\na person charged with a crime shall constitute insanity.\u201d RCW 10.77.030(3).\n\n       Prior to his second trial, Thompson requested that the jury be instructed\n\non insanity and sought to present evidence, through expert testimony, that he\n\nsuffered from mental illnesses\u2014specifically posttraumatic stress disorder,\n\ndepression, and a developmental disability\u2014which \u201crendered him unable to\n\nperceive the nature and quality of his act\u201d at the time of the offense. Thompson\n\nfiled a declaration from psychiatrist Dr. Richard Adler, in which Dr. Adler stated:\n\n       [M]y opinion is that Mr. Thompson was insane at the time of the\n       incident. As a result of his mental disease: Major Depression with\n       psychotic features, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and\n       Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to multiple etiologies, the\n       defendant\u2019s mind was affected to such an extent that he was\n       unable to perceive the nature and quality of the acts with which the\n       defendant is charged (intentional murder) and/or was unable to tell\n       right from wrong with reference to the particular acts with which\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/6\n\n\n       defendant is charged \u2013 i.e., overwhelmingly paranoid and acting in\n       self-defense. This mental state was aggravated by the\n       consumption of drugs and alcohol.\n\n       With regard to Thompson\u2019s voluntary intoxication at the time of the\n\noffense, Thompson\u2019s counsel explained:\n\n       We have opinions from our experts that say that by [the]\n       preponderance of the evidence according to their reasonable\n       medical certainty that Mr. Thompson was insane at the time, that\n       he was unable to appreciate the nature, the consequences of what\n       he was doing.\n                ....\n                Both experts say that they believe that Mr. Thompson\u2019s\n       voluntary intoxication did not proximately induce his inability to\n       perceive the nature and consequences of his actions. They believe\n       that given his developmental disability; his PTSD based on\n       longstanding, lifelong abuse, both physical and emotional; and then\n       finally, his depression, that given the situation with Mr. Ford where\n       Mr. Ford tries to sexually assault Mr. Thompson, they believe that\n       in response to that, even without the intoxication, he would have\n       responded in the same way. They do opine that Mr. Thompson\u2019s\n       intoxication was a factor and that maybe it had some role in\n       enhancing his paranoia at the time.\n\n       Nevertheless, the trial court excluded any reference to insanity because\n\nthe expert witnesses were of the opinion that Thompson\u2019s mental state at the\n\ntime of the offense was also impacted by his voluntary use of drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn doing so, the trial court assumed that the term \u201ccondition of mind\u201d refers to\n\ninsanity, observing that \u201cthere can be multiple proximate causes\u201d of a defendant\u2019s\n\nstate of mind, and stating that\n\n       RCW 10.77.030(3) talks about \u201cNo condition of mind proximately\n       induced by the voluntary act of a person charged with a crime shall\n       constitute insanity.\u201d Even taking the defense\u2019s experts\u2014in looking\n       at those reports in the light most favorable even to Mr. Thompson,\n       the defense experts cannot preclude intoxication\u2014voluntary\n       intoxication, as a proximate cause of having induced\u2014having been\n       an inducement.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/7\n\n\n        But insanity is not the \u201ccondition of mind\u201d referenced in the statute.3\n\nRather, insanity is a legal conclusion about a defendant\u2019s mental state that is\n\nappropriately made when a defendant\u2019s mind is so impaired by a \u201cmental disease\n\nor defect\u201d that the defendant is \u201cunable to perceive the nature and quality of the\n\nact with which he or she is charged\u201d or is \u201cunable to tell right from wrong with\n\nreference to the particular act charged.\u201d See RCW 9A.12.010. Thus, \u201ccondition\n\nof mind\u201d refers to the specific diagnosable condition testified to by the\n\ndefendant\u2019s witnesses or the State\u2019s witnesses in rebuttal. When such a\n\ncondition of mind arises involuntarily, it may amount to insanity. On the other\n\nhand, when such a condition of mind is proximately induced by a defendant\u2019s\n\nvoluntary acts, that condition is excluded from those mental diseases or defects\n\nthat may constitute insanity.\n\n        This meaning is apparent given the long history of the insanity defense in\n\nWashington. The insanity defense is rooted in the common law and, in\n\nWashington, predates statehood. See, e.g., McAllister v. Territory of Wash., 1\n\nWash. Terr. 360 (1872). In 1909, after the legislature enacted a statute\n\neliminating the insanity defense, our Supreme Court invalidated that statute,\n\nexplaining that\n\n        the sanity of the accused, at the time of committing the act charged\n        against him, has always been regarded as much a substantive fact,\n        going to make up his guilt, as the fact of his physical commission of\n        the act. It seems to us the law could as well exclude proof of any\n        other substantive fact going to show his guilt or innocence. If he\n        was insane at the time to the extent that he could not comprehend\n\n            3 This is apparent from the language of RCW 10.77.030. If \u201ccondition of mind\u201d meant\n\n\u201cinsanity,\u201d the statute would effectively state: \u201cNo [insanity] proximately induced by the voluntary\nact of a person charged with a crime shall constitute insanity.\u201d As such a reading contradicts\nitself, it is clearly not what the legislature intended.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/8\n\n\n       the nature and quality of the act\u2014in other words, if he had no will to\n       control the physical act of his physical body, how can it in truth be\n       said that the act was his act? To take from the accused the\n       opportunity to offer evidence tending to prove this fact, is, in our\n       opinion, as much a violation of his constitutional right of trial by jury\n       as to take from him the right to offer evidence before the jury\n       tending to show that he did not physically commit the act or\n       physically set in motion a train of events resulting in the act. The\n       maxim \u201cAn act done by me against my will is not my act,\u201d may,\n       without losing any of its force, be paraphrased to fit our present\n       inquiry as follows: \u201cAn act done by me without my will, or in the\n       absence of my will, is not my act.\u201d\n\nState v. Strasburg, 60 Wash. 106, 119-20, 110 P. 1020 (1910).\n\n       Until the adoption of the Revised Code of Washington in 1950,4 Rem.\n\nRev. Stat. \u00a7 2173 provided:\n\n       Any person who shall have committed a crime while insane, or in a\n       condition of mental irresponsibility,[5] and in whom such insanity or\n       mental irresponsibility continues to exist, shall be deemed criminally\n       insane within the meaning of this act. No condition of mind induced\n       by the voluntary act of a person charged with a crime shall be\n       deemed mental irresponsibility within the meaning of this act.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       In 1942, our Supreme Court, interpreting the statute cited above, held that\n\na \u201cmental irresponsibility\u201d defense \u201ccan only be applicable to those cases where\n\nthe condition of the mind results from some cause other than that of voluntary\n\nintoxication.\u201d State v. Huey, 14 Wn.2d 387, 394, 128 P.2d 314 (1942) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       In that case, the court explained that the defense is not available to an\n\notherwise sane person who is voluntarily intoxicated:\n\n\n\n       4 See Ch. 1.04 RCW.\n       5 The terms \u201cinsanity\u201d and \u201cmental irresponsibility\u201d have the same meaning. White, 60\nWn.2d at 586.\n\n\n                                             8\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/9\n\n\n        \u201cVoluntary intoxication does not excuse the commission of crime. A\n        rule almost universally recognized and applied is that a person\n        who, being sane and responsible for his acts, voluntarily becomes\n        intoxicated, with or without a preconceived design to commit a\n        crime, and while intoxicated, though it is to such a degree as to\n        render him wholly oblivious to his acts or conduct, does any act\n        which, if done by a person capable of distinguishing between right\n        and wrong, would be criminal if not excused or justified in some\n        way is responsible for his act, notwithstanding his mental condition\n        at the time.\u201d\n\nHuey, 14 Wn.2d at 395 (emphasis added) (quoting 15 AM. JUR. Criminal Law\n\n\u00a7 338, at 27 (1938)).\n\n        The Supreme Court then explained the purpose of the insanity defense\n\nand the voluntary intoxication exception:\n\n        \u201cIn general, insanity is an excuse for the commission of every crime\n        because the party has not the possession of that reason which\n        includes responsibility. An exception is when the crime is\n        committed by a party while in a fit of intoxication, the law not\n        permitting a man to avail himself of the excuse of his own gross\n        vice and misconduct to shelter himself from the legal consequences\n        of such crime.\u201d\n\nHuey, 14 Wn.2d at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v.\n\nKidwell, 62 W. Va. 466, 495, 59 S.E. 494 (1907)).\n\n        Accordingly, a defendant who was intoxicated during his offense and\n\npresented no medical testimony was not entitled to an insanity jury instruction, as\n\nthe \u201ccondition of his mind\u201d which limited his ability to distinguish right from wrong\n\nwas \u201cinduced solely by voluntary intoxication.\u201d Huey, 14 Wn.2d at 396.\n\n        Over 40 years later, after the insanity defense had been codified in RCW\n\n9A.12.010,6 our Supreme Court addressed the intersection of voluntary\n\n\n        6The voluntary act exception was then codified as former RCW 10.77.010(7) (1983),\nwhich provided that \u201c[n]o condition of mind proximately induced by the voluntary act of a person\ncharged with a crime shall constitute \u2018insanity.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n                                                9\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/10\n\n\nintoxication and insanity once again in State v. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d 620, 657 P.2d\n\n781 (1983). The Wicks court concluded that a defendant with a history of mental\n\nillness who committed criminal acts while suffering from a condition called toxic\n\npsychosis\u2014a severe mental disorder caused by voluntary use of alcohol or\n\ndrugs\u2014was not entitled to an insanity jury instruction. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 625-\n\n26. The Wicks court reasoned\u2014as the Huey court had before it\u2014that\n\n        evidence of voluntary intoxication, by itself, is insufficient to justify an\n        insanity instruction. This is so even if defendant although sane suffers\n        from a preexisting mental illness. The voluntary use of intoxicants is the\n        direct and immediate cause of insanity, not the preexisting mental illness.\n\nWicks, 98 Wn.2d at 622 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n        This limitation exists to prevent the law from \u201c\u2018allow[ing] one to steel his\n\nnerves, blanket his conscience, and fortify his resolve by taking drugs in\n\npreparation for a criminal enterprise.\u2019\u201d Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 623 (quoting State v.\n\nBower, 73 Wn.2d 634, 646, 440 P.2d 167 (1968)).\n\n        Thus, for many decades, Washington courts have ruled that a condition\n\nthat results from voluntary drug and alcohol is not evidence of insanity, even\n\nwhen the condition is a severe or unusual response to drug or alcohol use.7 But\n\nno Washington court has held that a defendant may not present evidence of\n\ninsanity\u2014caused by an involuntary mental illness\u2014simply because there is also\n\nevidence that voluntary drug or alcohol use impacted the defendant\u2019s mental\n\nstate. If evidence is adduced that a defendant was impacted by an involuntary\n\n\n         7 Although not applicable to this case, one exception to this rule exists. When long-term\n\nvoluntary drug use produces a \u201cpermanent mental disease amounting to insanity,\u201d distinct from\nthe temporary \u201cmental excitement\u201d of present intoxication, it may result in insanity. State v. Miller,\n177 Wash. 442, 463, 32 P.2d 535 (1934). For example, delirium tremens is a condition that may\nconstitute insanity. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 623.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/11\n\n\nmental condition that caused insanity and was also impacted by voluntary drug or\n\nalcohol use at the time of the offense, the evidence of insanity should be\n\npresented to the jury, and the jury should be instructed to consider whether the\n\nimpact of the involuntary condition alone would have rendered the defendant\n\ninsane.\n\n      Indeed, evidence of insanity has long been admitted and insanity defense\n\ninstructions given in such cases. For example, in State v. Matthews, a jury\n\nrejected the defendant\u2019s insanity defense despite four experts testifying that he\n\nwas insane at the time of the offense. 132 Wn. App. 936, 942, 135 P.3d 495\n\n(2006). We explained that the jury was entitled to do so given other evidence in\n\nthe record, including evidence that the defendant had voluntarily ingested\n\ncocaine, which supported an inference that Matthews was both sane and\n\nvoluntarily intoxicated. Matthews, 132 Wn. App. at 938-42.\n\n      Similarly, in State v. Putzell, a jury considered whether a defendant who\n\nhad both suffered a head injury and had consumed alcohol before shooting an\n\nacquaintance in a bar was insane at the time of the shooting. 40 Wn.2d 174,\n\n175-76, 242 P.2d 180 (1952). The jury rejected the defense. Putzell, 40 Wn.2d\n\nat 175. Our Supreme Court explained that it was entitled to do so:\n\n      Long and involved hypothetical questions were asked by counsel\n      for both sides, each upon facts favorable to their own contention.\n      The jury was not bound by the conclusions of the doctors in answer\n      to these questions. The ultimate conclusion, and the ultimate\n      decision as to the sanity or insanity of appellant, upon all of the\n      evidence in the case, and the law, as given to it by the court, was\n      the responsibility of the jury.\n\nPutzell, 40 Wn.2d at 179.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/12\n\n\n        In both cases, unrefuted evidence that each defendant had voluntarily\n\nused drugs or alcohol did not result in the exclusion of evidence advancing the\n\ninsanity defense. Rather, in each case, the defendant presented evidence of\n\ninsanity, the jury was instructed on insanity, and the jury made a determination\n\nas to the defendant\u2019s sanity.\n\n        Here, the trial court ruled based on its misunderstanding of the law.\n\nAccordingly, it abused its discretion by excluding Thompson\u2019s proffered evidence\n\npertaining to the defense. Because the result of this error was that Thompson\n\nwas not entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of insanity, which was his\n\ntheory of the case, the error was not harmless.8 Accordingly, we reverse and\n\nremand for a new trial.\n\n                                                 III\n\n        Thompson also contends that subjecting him to retrial after his first trial\n\nended in a mistrial violated his right to be free from double jeopardy under the\n\nWashington Constitution. This is so, he avers, because article I, section 9 of the\n\nWashington Constitution should be interpreted more broadly than its federal\n\ncounterpart and, under this broader protection, retrial was impermissible. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n        We review a double jeopardy claim de novo. State v. Strine, 176 Wn.2d\n\n742, 751, 293 P.3d 1177 (2013). The double jeopardy clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same\n\n\n\n        8 \u201cA harmless error is an error which is trivial, or formal, or merely academic, and was not\nprejudicial to the substantial rights of the party assigning it, and in no way affected the final\noutcome of the case.\u201d State v. Britton, 27 Wn.2d 336, 341, 178 P.2d 341 (1947).\n\n\n                                                12\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/13\n\n\noffense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend.

I, \u00a7 9.\n\nOur Supreme Court has held that \u201cWashington\u2019s double jeopardy clause is\n\nessentially identical to its federal counterpart and thus affords no greater\n\nprotection.\u201d State v. Benn, 161 Wn.2d 256, 261, 165 P.3d 1232 (2007); accord\n\nStrine, 176 Wn.2d at 751 (\u201c\u2018The federal and state [double jeopardy] provisions\n\nafford the same protections and are identical in thought, substance, and\n\npurpose.\u2019\u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State\n\nv. Ervin, 158 Wn.2d 746, 752, 147 P.3d 567 (2006))).\n\n       Double jeopardy generally does not bar retrial after a defendant moves for\n\na mistrial. Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 672-73, 102 S. Ct. 2083, 72 L. Ed.\n\n2d 416 (1982). A narrow exception to this rule exists when a prosecutor\n\nintentionally \u201c\u2018goad[s]\u2019\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial. Kennedy, 456\n\nU.S. at 676 (quoting United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 611, 96 S. Ct. 1075,\n\n47 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1976)).\n\n       Notwithstanding authority to the contrary, Thompson urges us to hold that\n\narticle I, section 9 offers broader protection than does the Fifth Amendment. He\n\noffers a Gunwall9 analysis in an attempt to convince us that our Supreme Court\n\nhas gone astray in its analysis of this issue. We find his entreaty uncompelling.\n\n       We are bound by the precedents of our Supreme Court. State v. Gore,\n\n101 Wn.2d 481, 487, 681 P.2d 227 (1984). Given that our Supreme Court has\n\n\n\n       9   State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808 (1986).\n\n\n                                               13\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/14\n\n\npreviously explained that the Washington Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause\n\ndoes not offer broader protection than does its federal counterpart, we need not\n\nengage in a Gunwall analysis, as urged upon us by Thompson. It is of no\n\nsignificance that our Supreme Court has not addressed the specific contention\n\narticulated by Thompson in his briefing. Indeed,\n\n            [i]f a court of appeals could disregard a decision of the Supreme\n            Court by identifying, and accepting, one or another contention not\n            expressly addressed by the Justices, the Court\u2019s decisions could\n            be circumvented with ease. They would bind only judges too dim-\n            witted to come up with a novel argument.\n\nNat\u2019l Rifle Ass\u2019n of Am., Inc. v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856, 858 (7th Cir. 2009),\n\nreversed on other grounds by McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 130 S.\n\nCt. 3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2010).\n\n       Here, the trial court found that the prosecutor did not intentionally cause a\n\nmistrial or act in bad faith. It also found that, notwithstanding the impropriety that\n\nnecessitated the mistrial, the prosecutor\u2019s challenged line of questioning\n\n\u201cprobably seemed clearly appropriate\u201d to her. Both findings well support the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s determination that the State did not intentionally provoke the mistrial.\n\n       Because Thompson did not establish that the prosecutor intentionally\n\nprovoked the mistrial, double jeopardy did not bar retrial. Accordingly,\n\nThompson\u2019s claim of error fails.10\n\n\n\n\n       10 Given our disposition of the two issues addressed herein, it is unnecessary for us to\naddress the other claims of error asserted in Thompson\u2019s briefing.\n\n\n                                              14\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/15\n\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                   15\n\f", "node": {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/5124292/", "id": 5124292, "absolute_url": "/opinion/5295730/state-of-washington-v-michael-sean-thompson/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/5295730/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2021-11-08T14:19:44.021052-08:00", "date_modified": "2021-11-08T14:21:45.864340-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "6340e6d729a6e1bb45c315c9f511103882995fd8", "page_count": 15, "download_url": "http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/806025.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2021/11/08/state_of_washington_v._michael_sean_thompson.pdf", "plain_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON\n\n STATE OF WASHINGTON,\n                                                    DIVISION ONE\n                       Respondent,\n                                                    No. 80602-5-I\n               v.\n                                                    PUBLISHED OPINION\n MICHAEL SEAN THOMPSON,\n\n                       Appellant.\n\n\n       DWYER, J. \u2014 Michael Thompson appeals from the judgment entered on a\n\njury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of murder in the second degree. He raises\n\nnumerous claims of error, among them that (1) the trial court erred by excluding\n\nevidence of his insanity and (2) double jeopardy barred his second trial after his\n\nfirst trial ended in a mistrial. His first claim has merit, his second does not.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                           I\n\n       Michael Thompson suffers from severe mental illness and began using\n\ndrugs regularly as a young teenager. In 2012, Thompson began living in an\n\napartment at Kenyon House, a housing program run by Sound Mental Health for\n\npeople who have been chronically homeless and suffer from both HIV (human\n\nimmunodeficiency virus) or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and\n\nchronic mental illness or substance abuse issues. In January 2014, Thompson\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/2\n\n\nwas sentenced on a conviction of taking a motor vehicle and was ordered to\n\nserve eight months on electronic home monitoring. Thompson was required to\n\nbegin serving this sentence by May 19, 2014. On that day, Thompson attempted\n\nto set up electronic home monitoring at his apartment at Kenyon House but was\n\nunable to do so because the equipment provided was incompatible with the\n\ntelephone line at his residence.\n\n        Thompson became depressed, believing that he would have to go to jail.\n\nHe began drinking alcohol and using drugs and continued to do so around\n\ndifferent areas of downtown Seattle for several days. Eventually, Thompson\n\nencountered an acquaintance, Daryl Ford. Ford and Thompson drank beer\n\ntogether and then went to Thompson\u2019s apartment and used drugs supplied by\n\nFord.\n\n        At trial, Thompson testified that, in the apartment, Ford made sexual\n\nadvances toward him over his verbal objections. According to Thompson\u2019s\n\ntestimony, Ford then repeatedly attempted to sexually assault Thompson and\n\nprevented Thompson from leaving the apartment at knifepoint, telling Thompson,\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t smoking my shit for free.\u201d Ford was \u201cslicing\u201d at Thompson with the\n\nknife, Thompson testified, causing Thompson to retreat to a bathroom in which\n\nhe hit his head against a towel rack, losing consciousness.\n\n        Upon awakening, Thompson found himself on the floor stabbing Ford\u2019s\n\nhand with the knife. Ford was dead. An autopsy later revealed that Ford had 87\n\ninjuries produced by a knife.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/3\n\n\n       Thompson cleaned the apartment and removed the body. He did so by\n\nwrapping Ford\u2019s body in blankets, placing it in a shopping cart, and pushing it\n\ndown the street. A neighbor saw him moving the cart, became suspicious, and\n\ncalled the police. Police officers discovered the body and found Thompson\u2019s\n\nfingerprints on the cart.\n\n       Thompson was arrested at his wife\u2019s home in south King County.1 He was\n\ncharged with murder in the second degree for causing the death of Ford while\n\ncommitting a felony (assault) while armed with a deadly weapon. The\n\ninformation was later amended to add an alternative count of intentional murder\n\nin the second degree while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n       Thompson\u2019s first trial took place in 2017. After 14 days, the judge\n\ndeclared a mistrial because the prosecutor asked Thompson several questions\n\nregarding why he had not told detectives about Ford\u2019s attempted assault, causing\n\nhim to explain several times that he had invoked his right to silence.\n\n       Thompson was tried again in 2019 with new defense counsel. He was\n\nconvicted of felony murder while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n       Thompson appeals.\n\n                                             II\n\n       Thompson contends that the trial court erred by denying him the right to\n\nadvance the defense of insanity. We regard Thompson\u2019s challenge as one to the\n\n\n\n\n       1 Thompson had been living separately from his wife and young children because of his\nserious mental health and substance abuse issues.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/4\n\n\ntrial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, which excluded any evidence of insanity, 2 and we\n\nagree.\n\n         According to Thompson, the trial court\u2019s ruling violated his \u201cright to present\n\na defense.\u201d Our Supreme Court has explained that a contention that an\n\nevidentiary ruling violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional \u201cright to present a defense\u201d\n\nis reviewed pursuant to a two-step process. State v. Arndt, 194 Wn.2d 784, 797-\n\n98, 453 P.3d 696 (2019). First, we review the challenged evidentiary ruling\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. Then, if necessary, we review de novo\n\nwhether the ruling violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a\n\ndefense. See Arndt, 194 Wn.2d at 797-98.\n\n         A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is manifestly\n\nunreasonable or based on untenable grounds or for untenable reasons, such as\n\na misunderstanding of the law. State v. Enriquez-Martinez, ___ Wn.2d ___, 492\n\nP.3d 162, 164 (2021).\n\n         Insanity is a defense that completely absolves a defendant of criminal\n\nliability. State v. Crenshaw, 98 Wn.2d 789, 793, 659 P.2d 488 (1983). It is\n\navailable only to \u201cthose persons who have lost contact with reality so completely\n\nthat they are beyond any of the influences of the criminal law.\u201d State v. White, 60\n\nWn.2d 551, 590, 374 P.2d 942 (1962). Insanity is an affirmative defense that the\n\ndefendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence. RCW\n\n10.77.030(2); State v. Box, 109 Wn.2d 320, 322, 745 P.2d 23 (1987).\n\n\n        2 As evidence of insanity was excluded, there was not evidence of insanity admitted that\n\nwould have entitled Thompson to an insanity instruction. See State v. Fisher, 185 Wn.2d 836,\n848, 374 P.3d 1185 (2016) (a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any theory of the\ncase that is supported by the evidence).\n\n\n                                                4\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/5\n\n\nAdditionally, \u201c[b]ecause the law presumes that an individual is sane at the time\n\nthat the individual commits a crime, a defendant asserting the insanity defense\n\nbears the initial burden of producing evidence of insanity.\u201d State v.\n\nChanthabouly, 164 Wn. App. 104, 127-28, 262 P.3d 144 (2011) (citing Box, 109\n\nWn.2d at 322). To establish the defense of insanity, the defendant must show\n\nthat\n\n              (1) [a]t the time of the commission of the offense, as a result\n       of mental disease or defect, the mind of the actor was affected to\n       such an extent that:\n              (a) He or she was unable to perceive the nature and quality\n       of the act with which he or she is charged; or\n              (b) He or she was unable to tell right from wrong with\n       reference to the particular act charged.\n\nRCW 9A.12.010.\n\n       Further, \u201c[n]o condition of mind proximately induced by the voluntary act of\n\na person charged with a crime shall constitute insanity.\u201d RCW 10.77.030(3).\n\n       Prior to his second trial, Thompson requested that the jury be instructed\n\non insanity and sought to present evidence, through expert testimony, that he\n\nsuffered from mental illnesses\u2014specifically posttraumatic stress disorder,\n\ndepression, and a developmental disability\u2014which \u201crendered him unable to\n\nperceive the nature and quality of his act\u201d at the time of the offense. Thompson\n\nfiled a declaration from psychiatrist Dr. Richard Adler, in which Dr. Adler stated:\n\n       [M]y opinion is that Mr. Thompson was insane at the time of the\n       incident. As a result of his mental disease: Major Depression with\n       psychotic features, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and\n       Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to multiple etiologies, the\n       defendant\u2019s mind was affected to such an extent that he was\n       unable to perceive the nature and quality of the acts with which the\n       defendant is charged (intentional murder) and/or was unable to tell\n       right from wrong with reference to the particular acts with which\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/6\n\n\n       defendant is charged \u2013 i.e., overwhelmingly paranoid and acting in\n       self-defense. This mental state was aggravated by the\n       consumption of drugs and alcohol.\n\n       With regard to Thompson\u2019s voluntary intoxication at the time of the\n\noffense, Thompson\u2019s counsel explained:\n\n       We have opinions from our experts that say that by [the]\n       preponderance of the evidence according to their reasonable\n       medical certainty that Mr. Thompson was insane at the time, that\n       he was unable to appreciate the nature, the consequences of what\n       he was doing.\n                ....\n                Both experts say that they believe that Mr. Thompson\u2019s\n       voluntary intoxication did not proximately induce his inability to\n       perceive the nature and consequences of his actions. They believe\n       that given his developmental disability; his PTSD based on\n       longstanding, lifelong abuse, both physical and emotional; and then\n       finally, his depression, that given the situation with Mr. Ford where\n       Mr. Ford tries to sexually assault Mr. Thompson, they believe that\n       in response to that, even without the intoxication, he would have\n       responded in the same way. They do opine that Mr. Thompson\u2019s\n       intoxication was a factor and that maybe it had some role in\n       enhancing his paranoia at the time.\n\n       Nevertheless, the trial court excluded any reference to insanity because\n\nthe expert witnesses were of the opinion that Thompson\u2019s mental state at the\n\ntime of the offense was also impacted by his voluntary use of drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn doing so, the trial court assumed that the term \u201ccondition of mind\u201d refers to\n\ninsanity, observing that \u201cthere can be multiple proximate causes\u201d of a defendant\u2019s\n\nstate of mind, and stating that\n\n       RCW 10.77.030(3) talks about \u201cNo condition of mind proximately\n       induced by the voluntary act of a person charged with a crime shall\n       constitute insanity.\u201d Even taking the defense\u2019s experts\u2014in looking\n       at those reports in the light most favorable even to Mr. Thompson,\n       the defense experts cannot preclude intoxication\u2014voluntary\n       intoxication, as a proximate cause of having induced\u2014having been\n       an inducement.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/7\n\n\n        But insanity is not the \u201ccondition of mind\u201d referenced in the statute.3\n\nRather, insanity is a legal conclusion about a defendant\u2019s mental state that is\n\nappropriately made when a defendant\u2019s mind is so impaired by a \u201cmental disease\n\nor defect\u201d that the defendant is \u201cunable to perceive the nature and quality of the\n\nact with which he or she is charged\u201d or is \u201cunable to tell right from wrong with\n\nreference to the particular act charged.\u201d See RCW 9A.12.010. Thus, \u201ccondition\n\nof mind\u201d refers to the specific diagnosable condition testified to by the\n\ndefendant\u2019s witnesses or the State\u2019s witnesses in rebuttal. When such a\n\ncondition of mind arises involuntarily, it may amount to insanity. On the other\n\nhand, when such a condition of mind is proximately induced by a defendant\u2019s\n\nvoluntary acts, that condition is excluded from those mental diseases or defects\n\nthat may constitute insanity.\n\n        This meaning is apparent given the long history of the insanity defense in\n\nWashington. The insanity defense is rooted in the common law and, in\n\nWashington, predates statehood. See, e.g., McAllister v. Territory of Wash., 1\n\nWash. Terr. 360 (1872). In 1909, after the legislature enacted a statute\n\neliminating the insanity defense, our Supreme Court invalidated that statute,\n\nexplaining that\n\n        the sanity of the accused, at the time of committing the act charged\n        against him, has always been regarded as much a substantive fact,\n        going to make up his guilt, as the fact of his physical commission of\n        the act. It seems to us the law could as well exclude proof of any\n        other substantive fact going to show his guilt or innocence. If he\n        was insane at the time to the extent that he could not comprehend\n\n            3 This is apparent from the language of RCW 10.77.030. If \u201ccondition of mind\u201d meant\n\n\u201cinsanity,\u201d the statute would effectively state: \u201cNo [insanity] proximately induced by the voluntary\nact of a person charged with a crime shall constitute insanity.\u201d As such a reading contradicts\nitself, it is clearly not what the legislature intended.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/8\n\n\n       the nature and quality of the act\u2014in other words, if he had no will to\n       control the physical act of his physical body, how can it in truth be\n       said that the act was his act? To take from the accused the\n       opportunity to offer evidence tending to prove this fact, is, in our\n       opinion, as much a violation of his constitutional right of trial by jury\n       as to take from him the right to offer evidence before the jury\n       tending to show that he did not physically commit the act or\n       physically set in motion a train of events resulting in the act. The\n       maxim \u201cAn act done by me against my will is not my act,\u201d may,\n       without losing any of its force, be paraphrased to fit our present\n       inquiry as follows: \u201cAn act done by me without my will, or in the\n       absence of my will, is not my act.\u201d\n\nState v. Strasburg, 60 Wash. 106, 119-20, 110 P. 1020 (1910).\n\n       Until the adoption of the Revised Code of Washington in 1950,4 Rem.\n\nRev. Stat. \u00a7 2173 provided:\n\n       Any person who shall have committed a crime while insane, or in a\n       condition of mental irresponsibility,[5] and in whom such insanity or\n       mental irresponsibility continues to exist, shall be deemed criminally\n       insane within the meaning of this act. No condition of mind induced\n       by the voluntary act of a person charged with a crime shall be\n       deemed mental irresponsibility within the meaning of this act.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       In 1942, our Supreme Court, interpreting the statute cited above, held that\n\na \u201cmental irresponsibility\u201d defense \u201ccan only be applicable to those cases where\n\nthe condition of the mind results from some cause other than that of voluntary\n\nintoxication.\u201d State v. Huey, 14 Wn.2d 387, 394, 128 P.2d 314 (1942) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       In that case, the court explained that the defense is not available to an\n\notherwise sane person who is voluntarily intoxicated:\n\n\n\n       4 See Ch. 1.04 RCW.\n       5 The terms \u201cinsanity\u201d and \u201cmental irresponsibility\u201d have the same meaning. White, 60\nWn.2d at 586.\n\n\n                                             8\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/9\n\n\n        \u201cVoluntary intoxication does not excuse the commission of crime. A\n        rule almost universally recognized and applied is that a person\n        who, being sane and responsible for his acts, voluntarily becomes\n        intoxicated, with or without a preconceived design to commit a\n        crime, and while intoxicated, though it is to such a degree as to\n        render him wholly oblivious to his acts or conduct, does any act\n        which, if done by a person capable of distinguishing between right\n        and wrong, would be criminal if not excused or justified in some\n        way is responsible for his act, notwithstanding his mental condition\n        at the time.\u201d\n\nHuey, 14 Wn.2d at 395 (emphasis added) (quoting 15 AM. JUR. Criminal Law\n\n\u00a7 338, at 27 (1938)).\n\n        The Supreme Court then explained the purpose of the insanity defense\n\nand the voluntary intoxication exception:\n\n        \u201cIn general, insanity is an excuse for the commission of every crime\n        because the party has not the possession of that reason which\n        includes responsibility. An exception is when the crime is\n        committed by a party while in a fit of intoxication, the law not\n        permitting a man to avail himself of the excuse of his own gross\n        vice and misconduct to shelter himself from the legal consequences\n        of such crime.\u201d\n\nHuey, 14 Wn.2d at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v.\n\nKidwell, 62 W. Va. 466, 495, 59 S.E. 494 (1907)).\n\n        Accordingly, a defendant who was intoxicated during his offense and\n\npresented no medical testimony was not entitled to an insanity jury instruction, as\n\nthe \u201ccondition of his mind\u201d which limited his ability to distinguish right from wrong\n\nwas \u201cinduced solely by voluntary intoxication.\u201d Huey, 14 Wn.2d at 396.\n\n        Over 40 years later, after the insanity defense had been codified in RCW\n\n9A.12.010,6 our Supreme Court addressed the intersection of voluntary\n\n\n        6The voluntary act exception was then codified as former RCW 10.77.010(7) (1983),\nwhich provided that \u201c[n]o condition of mind proximately induced by the voluntary act of a person\ncharged with a crime shall constitute \u2018insanity.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n                                                9\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/10\n\n\nintoxication and insanity once again in State v. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d 620, 657 P.2d\n\n781 (1983). The Wicks court concluded that a defendant with a history of mental\n\nillness who committed criminal acts while suffering from a condition called toxic\n\npsychosis\u2014a severe mental disorder caused by voluntary use of alcohol or\n\ndrugs\u2014was not entitled to an insanity jury instruction. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 625-\n\n26. The Wicks court reasoned\u2014as the Huey court had before it\u2014that\n\n        evidence of voluntary intoxication, by itself, is insufficient to justify an\n        insanity instruction. This is so even if defendant although sane suffers\n        from a preexisting mental illness. The voluntary use of intoxicants is the\n        direct and immediate cause of insanity, not the preexisting mental illness.\n\nWicks, 98 Wn.2d at 622 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n        This limitation exists to prevent the law from \u201c\u2018allow[ing] one to steel his\n\nnerves, blanket his conscience, and fortify his resolve by taking drugs in\n\npreparation for a criminal enterprise.\u2019\u201d Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 623 (quoting State v.\n\nBower, 73 Wn.2d 634, 646, 440 P.2d 167 (1968)).\n\n        Thus, for many decades, Washington courts have ruled that a condition\n\nthat results from voluntary drug and alcohol is not evidence of insanity, even\n\nwhen the condition is a severe or unusual response to drug or alcohol use.7 But\n\nno Washington court has held that a defendant may not present evidence of\n\ninsanity\u2014caused by an involuntary mental illness\u2014simply because there is also\n\nevidence that voluntary drug or alcohol use impacted the defendant\u2019s mental\n\nstate. If evidence is adduced that a defendant was impacted by an involuntary\n\n\n         7 Although not applicable to this case, one exception to this rule exists. When long-term\n\nvoluntary drug use produces a \u201cpermanent mental disease amounting to insanity,\u201d distinct from\nthe temporary \u201cmental excitement\u201d of present intoxication, it may result in insanity. State v. Miller,\n177 Wash. 442, 463, 32 P.2d 535 (1934). For example, delirium tremens is a condition that may\nconstitute insanity. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 623.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/11\n\n\nmental condition that caused insanity and was also impacted by voluntary drug or\n\nalcohol use at the time of the offense, the evidence of insanity should be\n\npresented to the jury, and the jury should be instructed to consider whether the\n\nimpact of the involuntary condition alone would have rendered the defendant\n\ninsane.\n\n      Indeed, evidence of insanity has long been admitted and insanity defense\n\ninstructions given in such cases. For example, in State v. Matthews, a jury\n\nrejected the defendant\u2019s insanity defense despite four experts testifying that he\n\nwas insane at the time of the offense. 132 Wn. App. 936, 942, 135 P.3d 495\n\n(2006). We explained that the jury was entitled to do so given other evidence in\n\nthe record, including evidence that the defendant had voluntarily ingested\n\ncocaine, which supported an inference that Matthews was both sane and\n\nvoluntarily intoxicated. Matthews, 132 Wn. App. at 938-42.\n\n      Similarly, in State v. Putzell, a jury considered whether a defendant who\n\nhad both suffered a head injury and had consumed alcohol before shooting an\n\nacquaintance in a bar was insane at the time of the shooting. 40 Wn.2d 174,\n\n175-76, 242 P.2d 180 (1952). The jury rejected the defense. Putzell, 40 Wn.2d\n\nat 175. Our Supreme Court explained that it was entitled to do so:\n\n      Long and involved hypothetical questions were asked by counsel\n      for both sides, each upon facts favorable to their own contention.\n      The jury was not bound by the conclusions of the doctors in answer\n      to these questions. The ultimate conclusion, and the ultimate\n      decision as to the sanity or insanity of appellant, upon all of the\n      evidence in the case, and the law, as given to it by the court, was\n      the responsibility of the jury.\n\nPutzell, 40 Wn.2d at 179.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/12\n\n\n        In both cases, unrefuted evidence that each defendant had voluntarily\n\nused drugs or alcohol did not result in the exclusion of evidence advancing the\n\ninsanity defense. Rather, in each case, the defendant presented evidence of\n\ninsanity, the jury was instructed on insanity, and the jury made a determination\n\nas to the defendant\u2019s sanity.\n\n        Here, the trial court ruled based on its misunderstanding of the law.\n\nAccordingly, it abused its discretion by excluding Thompson\u2019s proffered evidence\n\npertaining to the defense. Because the result of this error was that Thompson\n\nwas not entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of insanity, which was his\n\ntheory of the case, the error was not harmless.8 Accordingly, we reverse and\n\nremand for a new trial.\n\n                                                 III\n\n        Thompson also contends that subjecting him to retrial after his first trial\n\nended in a mistrial violated his right to be free from double jeopardy under the\n\nWashington Constitution. This is so, he avers, because article I, section 9 of the\n\nWashington Constitution should be interpreted more broadly than its federal\n\ncounterpart and, under this broader protection, retrial was impermissible. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n        We review a double jeopardy claim de novo. State v. Strine, 176 Wn.2d\n\n742, 751, 293 P.3d 1177 (2013). The double jeopardy clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same\n\n\n\n        8 \u201cA harmless error is an error which is trivial, or formal, or merely academic, and was not\nprejudicial to the substantial rights of the party assigning it, and in no way affected the final\noutcome of the case.\u201d State v. Britton, 27 Wn.2d 336, 341, 178 P.2d 341 (1947).\n\n\n                                                12\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/13\n\n\noffense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend. V. The\n\ndouble jeopardy clause of the Washington Constitution guarantees that \u201c[n]o\n\nperson shall . . . be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 9.\n\nOur Supreme Court has held that \u201cWashington\u2019s double jeopardy clause is\n\nessentially identical to its federal counterpart and thus affords no greater\n\nprotection.\u201d State v. Benn, 161 Wn.2d 256, 261, 165 P.3d 1232 (2007); accord\n\nStrine, 176 Wn.2d at 751 (\u201c\u2018The federal and state [double jeopardy] provisions\n\nafford the same protections and are identical in thought, substance, and\n\npurpose.\u2019\u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State\n\nv. Ervin, 158 Wn.2d 746, 752, 147 P.3d 567 (2006))).\n\n       Double jeopardy generally does not bar retrial after a defendant moves for\n\na mistrial. Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 672-73, 102 S. Ct. 2083, 72 L. Ed.\n\n2d 416 (1982). A narrow exception to this rule exists when a prosecutor\n\nintentionally \u201c\u2018goad[s]\u2019\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial. Kennedy, 456\n\nU.S. at 676 (quoting United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 611, 96 S. Ct. 1075,\n\n47 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1976)).\n\n       Notwithstanding authority to the contrary, Thompson urges us to hold that\n\narticle I, section 9 offers broader protection than does the Fifth Amendment. He\n\noffers a Gunwall9 analysis in an attempt to convince us that our Supreme Court\n\nhas gone astray in its analysis of this issue. We find his entreaty uncompelling.\n\n       We are bound by the precedents of our Supreme Court. State v. Gore,\n\n101 Wn.2d 481, 487, 681 P.2d 227 (1984). Given that our Supreme Court has\n\n\n\n       9   State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808 (1986).\n\n\n                                               13\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/14\n\n\npreviously explained that the Washington Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause\n\ndoes not offer broader protection than does its federal counterpart, we need not\n\nengage in a Gunwall analysis, as urged upon us by Thompson. It is of no\n\nsignificance that our Supreme Court has not addressed the specific contention\n\narticulated by Thompson in his briefing. Indeed,\n\n            [i]f a court of appeals could disregard a decision of the Supreme\n            Court by identifying, and accepting, one or another contention not\n            expressly addressed by the Justices, the Court\u2019s decisions could\n            be circumvented with ease. They would bind only judges too dim-\n            witted to come up with a novel argument.\n\nNat\u2019l Rifle Ass\u2019n of Am., Inc. v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856, 858 (7th Cir. 2009),\n\nreversed on other grounds by McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 130 S.\n\nCt. 3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2010).\n\n       Here, the trial court found that the prosecutor did not intentionally cause a\n\nmistrial or act in bad faith. It also found that, notwithstanding the impropriety that\n\nnecessitated the mistrial, the prosecutor\u2019s challenged line of questioning\n\n\u201cprobably seemed clearly appropriate\u201d to her. Both findings well support the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s determination that the State did not intentionally provoke the mistrial.\n\n       Because Thompson did not establish that the prosecutor intentionally\n\nprovoked the mistrial, double jeopardy did not bar retrial. Accordingly,\n\nThompson\u2019s claim of error fails.10\n\n\n\n\n       10 Given our disposition of the two issues addressed herein, it is unnecessary for us to\naddress the other claims of error asserted in Thompson\u2019s briefing.\n\n\n                                              14\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/15\n\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                   15\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON\n\n STATE OF WASHINGTON,\n                                                    DIVISION ONE\n                       Respondent,\n                                                    No. 80602-5-I\n               v.\n                                                    PUBLISHED OPINION\n MICHAEL SEAN THOMPSON,\n\n                       Appellant.\n\n\n       DWYER, J. \u2014 Michael Thompson appeals from the judgment entered on a\n\njury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of murder in the second degree.

His first claim has merit, his second does not.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                           I\n\n       Michael Thompson suffers from severe mental illness and began using\n\ndrugs regularly as a young teenager. In 2012, Thompson began living in an\n\napartment at Kenyon House, a housing program run by Sound Mental Health for\n\npeople who have been chronically homeless and suffer from both HIV (human\n\nimmunodeficiency virus) or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and\n\nchronic mental illness or substance abuse issues. In January 2014, Thompson\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/2\n\n\nwas sentenced on a conviction of taking a motor vehicle and was ordered to\n\nserve eight months on electronic home monitoring. Thompson was required to\n\nbegin serving this sentence by May 19, 2014. On that day, Thompson attempted\n\nto set up electronic home monitoring at his apartment at Kenyon House but was\n\nunable to do so because the equipment provided was incompatible with the\n\ntelephone line at his residence.\n\n        Thompson became depressed, believing that he would have to go to jail.\n\nHe began drinking alcohol and using drugs and continued to do so around\n\ndifferent areas of downtown Seattle for several days. Eventually, Thompson\n\nencountered an acquaintance, Daryl Ford. Ford and Thompson drank beer\n\ntogether and then went to Thompson\u2019s apartment and used drugs supplied by\n\nFord.\n\n        At trial, Thompson testified that, in the apartment, Ford made sexual\n\nadvances toward him over his verbal objections. According to Thompson\u2019s\n\ntestimony, Ford then repeatedly attempted to sexually assault Thompson and\n\nprevented Thompson from leaving the apartment at knifepoint, telling Thompson,\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t smoking my shit for free.\u201d Ford was \u201cslicing\u201d at Thompson with the\n\nknife, Thompson testified, causing Thompson to retreat to a bathroom in which\n\nhe hit his head against a towel rack, losing consciousness.\n\n        Upon awakening, Thompson found himself on the floor stabbing Ford\u2019s\n\nhand with the knife. Ford was dead. An autopsy later revealed that Ford had 87\n\ninjuries produced by a knife.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/3\n\n\n       Thompson cleaned the apartment and removed the body. He did so by\n\nwrapping Ford\u2019s body in blankets, placing it in a shopping cart, and pushing it\n\ndown the street. A neighbor saw him moving the cart, became suspicious, and\n\ncalled the police. Police officers discovered the body and found Thompson\u2019s\n\nfingerprints on the cart.\n\n       Thompson was arrested at his wife\u2019s home in south King County.1 He was\n\ncharged with murder in the second degree for causing the death of Ford while\n\ncommitting a felony (assault) while armed with a deadly weapon. The\n\ninformation was later amended to add an alternative count of intentional murder\n\nin the second degree while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n       Thompson\u2019s first trial took place in 2017. After 14 days, the judge\n\ndeclared a mistrial because the prosecutor asked Thompson several questions\n\nregarding why he had not told detectives about Ford\u2019s attempted assault, causing\n\nhim to explain several times that he had invoked his right to silence.\n\n       Thompson was tried again in 2019 with new defense counsel. He was\n\nconvicted of felony murder while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n       Thompson appeals.\n\n                                             II\n\n       Thompson contends that the trial court erred by denying him the right to\n\nadvance the defense of insanity.

As a result of his mental disease: Major Depression with\n       psychotic features, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and\n       Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to multiple etiologies, the\n       defendant\u2019s mind was affected to such an extent that he was\n       unable to perceive the nature and quality of the acts with which the\n       defendant is charged (intentional murder) and/or was unable to tell\n       right from wrong with reference to the particular acts with which\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/6\n\n\n       defendant is charged \u2013 i.e., overwhelmingly paranoid and acting in\n       self-defense. This mental state was aggravated by the\n       consumption of drugs and alcohol.\n\n       With regard to Thompson\u2019s voluntary intoxication at the time of the\n\noffense, Thompson\u2019s counsel explained:\n\n       We have opinions from our experts that say that by [the]\n       preponderance of the evidence according to their reasonable\n       medical certainty that Mr. Thompson was insane at the time, that\n       he was unable to appreciate the nature, the consequences of what\n       he was doing.\n                ....\n                Both experts say that they believe that Mr. Thompson\u2019s\n       voluntary intoxication did not proximately induce his inability to\n       perceive the nature and consequences of his actions. They believe\n       that given his developmental disability; his PTSD based on\n       longstanding, lifelong abuse, both physical and emotional; and then\n       finally, his depression, that given the situation with Mr. Ford where\n       Mr. Ford tries to sexually assault Mr. Thompson, they believe that\n       in response to that, even without the intoxication, he would have\n       responded in the same way. They do opine that Mr. Thompson\u2019s\n       intoxication was a factor and that maybe it had some role in\n       enhancing his paranoia at the time.\n\n       Nevertheless, the trial court excluded any reference to insanity because\n\nthe expert witnesses were of the opinion that Thompson\u2019s mental state at the\n\ntime of the offense was also impacted by his voluntary use of drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn doing so, the trial court assumed that the term \u201ccondition of mind\u201d refers to\n\ninsanity, observing that \u201cthere can be multiple proximate causes\u201d of a defendant\u2019s\n\nstate of mind, and stating that\n\n       RCW 10.77.030(3) talks about \u201cNo condition of mind proximately\n       induced by the voluntary act of a person charged with a crime shall\n       constitute insanity.\u201d Even taking the defense\u2019s experts\u2014in looking\n       at those reports in the light most favorable even to Mr. Thompson,\n       the defense experts cannot preclude intoxication\u2014voluntary\n       intoxication, as a proximate cause of having induced\u2014having been\n       an inducement.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/7\n\n\n        But insanity is not the \u201ccondition of mind\u201d referenced in the statute.3\n\nRather, insanity is a legal conclusion about a defendant\u2019s mental state that is\n\nappropriately made when a defendant\u2019s mind is so impaired by a \u201cmental disease\n\nor defect\u201d that the defendant is \u201cunable to perceive the nature and quality of the\n\nact with which he or she is charged\u201d or is \u201cunable to tell right from wrong with\n\nreference to the particular act charged.\u201d See RCW 9A.12.010. Thus, \u201ccondition\n\nof mind\u201d refers to the specific diagnosable condition testified to by the\n\ndefendant\u2019s witnesses or the State\u2019s witnesses in rebuttal. When such a\n\ncondition of mind arises involuntarily, it may amount to insanity. On the other\n\nhand, when such a condition of mind is proximately induced by a defendant\u2019s\n\nvoluntary acts, that condition is excluded from those mental diseases or defects\n\nthat may constitute insanity.\n\n        This meaning is apparent given the long history of the insanity defense in\n\nWashington. The insanity defense is rooted in the common law and, in\n\nWashington, predates statehood. See, e.g., McAllister v. Territory of Wash., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4736244\"><a href=\"/opinion/4928657/mcallister-v-territory/\">1\n\nWash. Terr. 360</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1872). In 1909, after the legislature enacted a statute\n\neliminating the insanity defense, our Supreme Court invalidated that statute,\n\nexplaining that\n\n        the sanity of the accused, at the time of committing the act charged\n        against him, has always been regarded as much a substantive fact,\n        going to make up his guilt, as the fact of his physical commission of\n        the act. It seems to us the law could as well exclude proof of any\n        other substantive fact going to show his guilt or innocence. If he\n        was insane at the time to the extent that he could not comprehend\n\n            3 This is apparent from the language of RCW 10.77.030. If \u201ccondition of mind\u201d meant\n\n\u201cinsanity,\u201d the statute would effectively state: \u201cNo [insanity] proximately induced by the voluntary\nact of a person charged with a crime shall constitute insanity.\u201d As such a reading contradicts\nitself, it is clearly not what the legislature intended.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNo. 80602-5-I/8\n\n\n       the nature and quality of the act\u2014in other words, if he had no will to\n       control the physical act of his physical body, how can it in truth be\n       said that the act was his act? To take from the accused the\n       opportunity to offer evidence tending to prove this fact, is, in our\n       opinion, as much a violation of his constitutional right of trial by jury\n       as to take from him the right to offer evidence before the jury\n       tending to show that he did not physically commit the act or\n       physically set in motion a train of events resulting in the act. The\n       maxim \u201cAn act done by me against my will is not my act,\u201d may,\n       without losing any of its force, be paraphrased to fit our present\n       inquiry as follows: \u201cAn act done by me without my will, or in the\n       absence of my will, is not my act.\u201d\n\nState v.

The Wicks court concluded that a defendant with a history of mental\n\nillness who committed criminal acts while suffering from a condition called toxic\n\npsychosis\u2014a severe mental disorder caused by voluntary use of alcohol or\n\ndrugs\u2014was not entitled to an insanity jury instruction. Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 625-\n\n26. The Wicks court reasoned\u2014as the Huey court had before it\u2014that\n\n        evidence of voluntary intoxication, by itself, is insufficient to justify an\n        insanity instruction. This is so even if defendant although sane suffers\n        from a preexisting mental illness. The voluntary use of intoxicants is the\n        direct and immediate cause of insanity, not the preexisting mental illness.\n\nWicks, 98 Wn.2d at 622 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n        This limitation exists to prevent the law from \u201c\u2018allow[ing] one to steel his\n\nnerves, blanket his conscience, and fortify his resolve by taking drugs in\n\npreparation for a criminal enterprise.\u2019\u201d Wicks, 98 Wn.2d at 623 (quoting State v.\n\nBower, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411101\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411101/state-v-bower/\">73 Wn.2d 634</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411101\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411101/state-v-bower/\">440 P.2d 167</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968)).\n\n        Thus, for many decades, Washington courts have ruled that a condition\n\nthat results from voluntary drug and alcohol is not evidence of insanity, even\n\nwhen the condition is a severe or unusual response to drug or alcohol use.7 But\n\nno Washington court has held that a defendant may not present evidence of\n\ninsanity\u2014caused by an involuntary mental illness\u2014simply because there is also\n\nevidence that voluntary drug or alcohol use impacted the defendant\u2019s mental\n\nstate.

We conclude\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not wholly preclude from diversion defendants who suffer\nfrom both excluded and included mental health disorders; section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\nrequires only that a defendant suffers from one qualified mental health disorder. The trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of diversion was incorrect under our interpretation of the\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the trial court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for\na new eligibility hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for diversion under section 1001.36.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n       Petitioner has two pending criminal cases. Petitioner filed a motion for mental\nhealth diversion in both cases, a hearing was held on June 22, 2021, and the trial court\ndenied the motions on the ground petitioner was statutorily ineligible for diversion\nbecause his ASPD diagnosis is an excluded disorder under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless indicated otherwise.\n2       We use the term \u201cqualifying\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d interchangeably to describe disorders that\nare identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM) and are not expressly excluded by section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                                2.\n\f(See \u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in both cases to\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion.\nI.     Kern Superior Court Case No. BF180104A\n       On February 18, 2020, police officers witnessed a driver, later identified as\npetitioner, crashing into another car. A traffic stop was attempted, but petitioner refused\nto stop and led police on a chase that lasted several miles. Police ultimately subdued and\narrested him. The driver whose car petitioner crashed into said she had been rammed by\npetitioner\u2019s blue pickup truck three times, tried to move out of the way of the truck, but\npetitioner blocked her from doing so, and then petitioner\u2019s blue truck hit her car\u2019s\npassenger side. 3\n       Following a preliminary examination, an information was filed on March 6, 2020,\nwhich alleged two felony counts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon (a car) under\nsection 245, subdivision (a)(1) and (2) felony evasion of a peace officer in violation of\nVehicle Code section 2800.2. As to each count, two prior felony convictions were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)) and\nalleged to be serious prior felonies under section 667, subdivision (a).\nII.    Kern Superior Court Case No. BF182498A\n       While the first case was pending, a driver later identified as petitioner was seen by\npolice running a red light in a maroon pickup truck on September 17, 2020. When the\nofficer attempted a traffic stop, petitioner waived his hand out the window and yelled,\n\u201c\u2018no brakes.\u2019\u201d A chase ensued, petitioner fled the vehicle and hid, but officers found him\nand arrested him after he initially resisted.\n       After a preliminary hearing was held, an information was filed on October 29,\n2020, alleging (1) felony evading a police officer under Vehicle Code section 2800.2;\n\n\n3       The background facts in both matters are taken from the preliminary examination hearing\ntranscripts. These facts have not been proven or admitted.\n\n\n                                                3.\n\f(2) resisting or obstructing a police officer in violation of section 148, subdivision (a)(1);\nand (3) driving without a license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500,\nsubdivision (a), a misdemeanor. An enhancement was alleged as to count 1 for\ncommitting an offense while on bail under section 12022.1, and prior felony strikes were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law.\nIII.   Mental Health Diversion Requested and Denied in Both Cases\n       A.     Medical Evaluation\n       On March 25, 2021, petitioner underwent a psychological evaluation with\nDr. Musacco. Dr. Musacco was provided Bakersfield Police Department records,\npetitioner\u2019s prior evaluations for competency to stand trial, mental health records from\nCalifornia Correctional Health Care Services, and petitioner\u2019s criminal rap sheet.\n       Following the evaluation, Dr. Musacco diagnosed petitioner with (1) stimulant use\ndisorder, in remission in a controlled environment; (2) unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum disorder; (3) borderline intellectual functioning; and (4) ASPD. The ASPD\ndiagnosis was based upon petitioner\u2019s criminal behaviors that Dr. Musacco characterized\nas occurring throughout petitioner\u2019s adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Musacco opined\npetitioner\u2019s psychosis, drug use disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning\ncontributed to his criminal behaviors, but that petitioner\u2019s ASPD was an \u201cimportant\ncondition contributing to his actions.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[s]ome of the [petitioner\u2019s]\nmental conditions would be responsive to treatment. For example, if the [petitioner]\nsuccessfully participated in a drug treatment program, I believe his functioning would\nsubstantially improve. The [petitioner\u2019s] symptoms of psychosis would also be amenable\nto antipsychotic medications. The [petitioner\u2019s] Borderline Intellectual Functioning\nwould not be amenable to psychiatric treatment per se.\u201d\n       B.     Hearing on Petitioner\u2019s Motions for Mental Health Diversion\n       Supported by Dr. Musacco\u2019s evaluation, petitioner filed a motion seeking mental\nhealth diversion under section 1001.36 in both of his pending criminal cases, and a\n\n                                              4.\n\fhearing on the motions was held on June 22, 2021. The defense called Dr. Musacco as an\nexpert witness, and he gave testimony consistent with his written evaluation. As far as\nhow petitioner\u2019s diagnosed conditions contributed to his criminal conduct, Dr. Musacco\nexplained there was \u201ckind of an accumulative effect amongst these diagnoses,\u201d and that\npetitioner\u2019s three qualifying disorders operated together to significantly contribute to his\ncriminal conduct.\n       Dr. Musacco also explained, however, that it \u201cwould be impossible to subtract out\nthe influence of an [ASPD] here, and that\u2019s why I referenced it early on as an important\ncondition, which I believe has pervasive impact on his functioning. Also saying that it is\nalso a condition that does not qualify for Diversion. So[,] I don\u2019t think that there is\u2014you\nknow, each [of] these conditions have\u2014they are interrelated, and I don\u2019t [think] there is a\nway to entirely pull one string apart from the other and get a\u2014be able to say, you know,\nfor example, his drug use disorder didn\u2019t play a role in this\u2014in his behavior. I don\u2019t\nthink I could do that, and I don\u2019t think I could do that on an [ASPD] as well. They are all\ntangled up.\u201d\n       The court questioned Dr. Musacco during the hearing as well:\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I understand this. The 4\n       diagnos[e]s you offer, you can\u2019t separate any one of those out?\n\n             \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Well, I can separate A[S]PD \u2026 for this\n       purpose because it\u2019s excluded. We\u2019ve got to say I can\u2019t consider that.\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: But if\u2014here is what I\u2019m getting at .\u2026 If they\n       exclude someone with [ASPD] if that\u2019s all he had, he would be excluded?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Absolutely.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: But he has these 3 other diagnos[e]s. How does the\n       fact he has one of them, the [ASPD], does that mean he\u2019s not eligible\n       because he has it and the doctor can\u2019t exclude that as a factor in his\n       behavior, or can the Court rule well, he\u2019s got these other diagnos[e]s. Can I\n       ignore the A[S]PD .\u2026? Can I exclude that? I don\u2019t think\u2014Doctor, what I\n       hear you say is these are all intermixed?\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I believe so, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: So[,] let me ask you this. Does his [ASPD] [a]ffect\n       his decisions in using illegal drugs, s[t]imulants such as methamphetamine?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I would say, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: And then. Okay. Is there \u2026 is one of these\u2014any\n       one of these 4 predominant do you think or just all intermixed?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I think it is day-by-day, hour-by-hour. But the\n       Borderline Intellectual Functioning and [ASPD] are both, they are kind of\n       steady ongoing issues. They don\u2019t spike or plateau the way the substance\n       use disorder would or the [p]sychosis would. So\u2014so his personality\n       disorder is an ingrained chronic condition that we wouldn\u2019t expect again\n       based on the eval[uation]. Same with Borderline Intellectual Functioning,\n       he\u2019s not going to get smarter or less smart[] day 1 to day 2. But if he\u2019s\n       using drugs \u2026 or hearing v[o]ices, we can anticipate that his function will\n       decline due to those added stressor[s]. So again, it is kind of a\u2014it is like a\n       ball [of] string and you pull one out, but you can\u2019t entirely separate it from\n       the ball as you have it.\u201d\n       When asked on redirect to characterize ASPD, Dr. Musacco explained the\ndiagnosis for ASPD is characterized as \u201ca pattern of criminal behavior, ignoring rules, or\nbeing willing to violate rules, neglecting obligations. You know, when we think about a\ntypical person who is a revolving door of prison in jail, a vast\u2014well, at least a majority\nof those persons have [ASPD]. Meaning, they have characteristically violated rules and\n[norms] and expectations to their detriment and the detriment of those around them.\u201d\n       C.      Denial of Diversion and Petitioner\u2019s Writ Petitions\n       The court denied the motions for diversion, noting Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion that\npetitioner\u2019s qualifying disorders were all interrelated with his ASPD. The court ruled\npetitioner is statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under section 1001.36\nbecause he suffers from ASPD, an excluded condition. The court explained that although\npetitioner has three other eligible conditions, the fourth diagnosis for ASPD operated as a\nbar to eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate in both underlying cases to vacate\nthe court\u2019s order and grant his motions for admission into a mental health diversion\nprogram under section 1001.36.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that he suffers from qualifying mental health\ndisorders under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), which the court acknowledged. According to\npetitioner, the fact that he also suffers from ASPD does not make him per se ineligible for\ndiversion under section 1001.36, and the court erred in concluding otherwise. Moreover,\npetitioner maintains, he has satisfied all of the requirements for diversion under\nsection 1001.36 and his motions for diversion should be granted.\n       The Attorney General filed responses to the petitions on behalf of the People, the\nreal party in interest. The Attorney General agrees that the trial court erred in denying\ndiversion on the ground petitioner suffers from ASPD\u2014the fact petitioner has been\ndiagnosed with an excluded mental disorder does not bar him completely from diversion\nwhen he also suffers from other qualified mental health disorders. Moreover, according\nto the Attorney General, the court\u2019s order did not address whether petitioner\u2019s qualifying\nmental disorders were a significant factor in the charged offenses and whether the mental\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior would respond to treatment. (See \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B) & (C).) The Attorney General urges this court to grant the petition for a\nwrit of mandate, vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion, and remand for another\nhearing to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for diversion.\nI.     Mental Health Diversion Under Section 1001.36\n       Effective June 27, 2018, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for\ndefendants with diagnosed and qualifying mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (a).) One of the stated\npurposes of the legislation was to promote \u201c[i]ncreased diversion of individuals with\nmental disorders \u2026 while protecting public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.35, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              7.\n\f          \u201c\u2018[P]retrial diversion\u2019 means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily\nor permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is\ncharged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health\ntreatment .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the defendant has performed satisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial\ndiversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n          \u201cOn an accusatory pleading alleging the commission of a misdemeanor or felony\noffense, the court may, after considering the positions of the defense and prosecution,\ngrant pretrial diversion \u2026 if the defendant meets all of the requirements .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (a).) There are six requirements. (Id., subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(F).)\n          First, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant suffers from a mental disorder\nas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder shall be provided by\nthe defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, the court must also be \u201csatisfied that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was\na significant factor in the commission of the charged offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B).) \u201cA court may conclude that a defendant\u2019s mental disorder was a\nsignificant factor in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any\nrelevant and credible evidence, \u2026 the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder substantially contributed to the defendant\u2019s involvement in the commission of\nthe offense.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\f       Third, \u201ca qualified mental health expert\u201d must opine that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to\nmental health treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Fourth, subject to certain exceptions, the defendant must consent to diversion and\nwaive his or her right to a speedy trial. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(D).) Fifth, the defendant\nmust agree \u201cto comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1)(E).)\n       Finally, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant will not pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety \u2026 if treated in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(F).)\n       If a trial court determines that a defendant meets the six requirements, then the\ncourt must also determine whether \u201cthe recommended inpatient or outpatient program of\nmental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the\ndefendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(1)(A).) The court may then grant diversion and refer\nthe defendant to an approved treatment program. (Id., subd. (c)(1)(B).) \u201cThe period\nduring which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no\nlonger than two years.\u201d (Id., subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant commits additional crimes,\nor otherwise performs unsatisfactorily in diversion, then the court may reinstate criminal\nproceedings. (Id., subd. (d).) However, if the defendant performs \u201csatisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings .\u2026\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n       The Legislature amended section 1001.36 a few months after it was enacted \u201cto\nspecify that defendants charged with certain crimes, such as murder and rape, are\nineligible for diversion.\u201d (People v. Frahs (2020) 9 Cal.5th 618, 627; see \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(2).)\nII.    Mental Health Diversion Eligibility Under Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\n       Among other mandatory prerequisites, diversion may be granted if a defendant\nestablishes under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that he or she \u201csuffers from a mental disorder\n\n                                             9.\n\fas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).)\n       The central question presented is whether a diagnosis for ASPD\u2014an excluded\ndisorder\u2014renders petitioner statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) even though the court concluded petitioner has three other\nqualifying mental health disorders.\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A trial court\u2019s factual findings under section 1001.36 must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and the court\u2019s diversion eligibility determinations are reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion. (People v. Oneal (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 581, 588\u2013589 [reviewing\nunder abuse of discretion standard whether the defendant\u2019s disorder played a significant\nrole in the commission of charged offense]; People v. Moine (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 440,\n448\u2013449 [whether the defendant posed unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if\ntreated in the community reviewed for abuse of discretion].)\n       The question posed here, however, is one that turns on an issue of statutory\ninterpretation and the application of that statute to undisputed facts: whether a person\ndiagnosed with both qualifying and excluded mental health disorders is statutorily\nineligible for diversion under the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Our review of\nthis issue is de novo. (People v. Prunty (2015) 62 Cal.4th 59, 71 [statutory\ninterpretation]; People v. Chubbuck (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1, 7 [application of statute to\nundisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review].)\n       B.     Petitioner is Not Statutorily Ineligible for Diversion\n       Petitioner and the Attorney General maintain section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not\nestablish a bar to diversion based on the presence of an excluded disorder, such as ASPD.\nThey argue section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) merely limits the types of disorders a defendant\n\n                                            10.\n\fmay use to carry his or her burden of establishing a qualifying disorder. In other words, a\ndefendant satisfies section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) so long as he or she suffers from a\nqualifying disorder, even if he or she is also diagnosed with an excluded disorder.\nAccording to petitioner and the Attorney General, the trial court improperly treated\npetitioner\u2019s ASPD diagnosis as a bar to diversion rather than simply recognizing that this\ndiagnosis could not be used to satisfy the requirement of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n       The trial court obviously interpreted section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) differently and\nconcluded that petitioner is statutorily ineligible for diversion, regardless of his other\nqualifying mental disorders, because he suffers from ASPD\u2014an excluded disorder. The\ntrial court is not alone in interpreting the statute to entirely preclude diversion for those\ndefendants who suffer from an excluded disorder listed in section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). As\none treatise has noted, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the statute suggests the Legislature\nintended to exclude persons with [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and\npedophilia, whether the person also suffers from other, qualified disorders.\u201d (Couzens et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2021) \u00a7 7:22).)\n       Despite these differing interpretations of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the language\nstrikes us as unambiguous. Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires the defendant to establish\nhe or she suffers from \u201ca mental disorder\u201d identified in the most recent edition of the\nDSM and then provides a nonexhaustive list of included disorders that suffice, followed\nby a list of excluded disorders that do not. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A), italics added.) Listing\nincluded and excluded disorders in this format simply articulates which disorders may\nand may not serve to prove the defendant has at least one qualifying mental disorder.\n       It is entirely predictable, and thus certainly within the contemplation of the\nLegislature, that a person might suffer from included and excluded disorders. Because\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires suffering only one included disorder, the Legislature\nwould have been aware a defendant could still meet that requirement notwithstanding\nsuffering from a disorder section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) designates as excluded. Had the\n\n                                              11.\n\fLegislature intended to wholly preclude from diversion any person diagnosed with an\nexcluded disorder (regardless of concurrently suffering from included disorders), the\nsentence phrasing of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) would have shifted from simply listing\nexcluded disorders to disqualifying persons with any of the excluded disorders.\n       But even assuming the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) was ambiguous in\nthis regard, the result is no different. One of the stated purposes of title 6, part 2,\nchapter 2.8A of the Penal Code, of which section 1001.36 is a part, is to increase\ndiversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals\u2019 entry and\nreentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. (\u00a7 1001.35,\nsubd. (a).) This purpose militates an interpretation of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that\nfosters more inclusivity in diversion eligibility, not less. Wholly eliminating diversion\neligibility for defendants who suffer from qualifying disorders because they also suffer\nfrom an excluded disorder does not further this purpose. 4 Rather, it potentially excludes\na wide swath of defendants who otherwise suffer from qualifying disorders that could be\namenable to treatment, and whose entry and reentry into the criminal justice system\nmight be mitigated. (See People v. Cornett (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265 [if statute is\nambiguous, courts may consider other aids such as the statute\u2019s purpose].)\nSection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) simply disallows defendants from establishing eligibility for\ndiversion based on an excluded disorder. Suffering from an excluded disorder does not\ncategorically bar defendants from establishing eligibility based on a different, qualifying\ndisorder.\n       We conclude that because petitioner suffered from eligible, qualifying mental\ndisorders that the court accepted as proven, petitioner\u2019s additional diagnosis for ASPD,\n\n4       At the hearing, Dr. Musacco estimated \u201cat least a majority\u201d of incarcerated persons suffer\nfrom ASPD. It is not clear whether that estimate is based on the diagnostic criteria of ASPD laid\nout in the most recent edition of the DSM, but it underscores how eliminating all eligibility for\nthose suffering from ASPD and other included mental conditions would likely have an expansive\nexcluding effect.\n\n\n                                               12.\n\fan excluded disorder, did not render him statutorily ineligible under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Denial of diversion eligibility merely because of the existence\nof an excluded disorder was incorrect.\nIII.   A New Diversion Eligibility Hearing is Required\n       As the trial court rested its denial of diversion on ineligibility under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the court did not consider the remaining diversion eligibility\nprerequisites. For example, the court did not consider whether the qualified disorders\nwere significant factors in the commission of the offenses and whether the qualified\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior were treatable. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(B) & (C).)\nThese determinations may be more difficult with diagnoses for included and excluded\ndisorders. Dr. Musacco explained he had considered petitioner\u2019s qualifying mental\ndisorders in isolation from his ASPD, but he acknowledged he could not neatly separate\npetitioner\u2019s behavior by disorder\u2014one disorder might exacerbate others and together\ncause a behavioral function decline. In the context of Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion, the trial\ncourt alluded to the complexity of assessing which disorder contributed to petitioner\u2019s\ncriminal conduct and whether that disorder would respond to treatment. A new eligibility\nhearing is required for the court to consider these and all other remaining eligibility\nprerequisites under section 1001.36(b)(1).\n       We express no opinion how the trial court should evaluate the remaining eligibility\nrequirements, including the interrelationship among included and excluded disorders for\nthe purposes of section 1001.36, subdivision (b)(1)(B) and (C), or whether petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for diversion should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of mandate is granted as follows: the trial court\u2019s\norder denying diversion is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a new hearing in\naccordance with this opinion on petitioner\u2019s motion for mental health diversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              MEEHAN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nSMITH, Acting P.

We conclude\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not wholly preclude from diversion defendants who suffer\nfrom both excluded and included mental health disorders; section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\nrequires only that a defendant suffers from one qualified mental health disorder. The trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of diversion was incorrect under our interpretation of the\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the trial court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for\na new eligibility hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for diversion under section 1001.36.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n       Petitioner has two pending criminal cases. Petitioner filed a motion for mental\nhealth diversion in both cases, a hearing was held on June 22, 2021, and the trial court\ndenied the motions on the ground petitioner was statutorily ineligible for diversion\nbecause his ASPD diagnosis is an excluded disorder under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless indicated otherwise.\n2       We use the term \u201cqualifying\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d interchangeably to describe disorders that\nare identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM) and are not expressly excluded by section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                                2.\n\f(See \u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in both cases to\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion.\nI.     Kern Superior Court Case No. BF180104A\n       On February 18, 2020, police officers witnessed a driver, later identified as\npetitioner, crashing into another car. A traffic stop was attempted, but petitioner refused\nto stop and led police on a chase that lasted several miles. Police ultimately subdued and\narrested him. The driver whose car petitioner crashed into said she had been rammed by\npetitioner\u2019s blue pickup truck three times, tried to move out of the way of the truck, but\npetitioner blocked her from doing so, and then petitioner\u2019s blue truck hit her car\u2019s\npassenger side. 3\n       Following a preliminary examination, an information was filed on March 6, 2020,\nwhich alleged two felony counts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon (a car) under\nsection 245, subdivision (a)(1) and (2) felony evasion of a peace officer in violation of\nVehicle Code section 2800.2. As to each count, two prior felony convictions were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)) and\nalleged to be serious prior felonies under section 667, subdivision (a).\nII.    Kern Superior Court Case No. BF182498A\n       While the first case was pending, a driver later identified as petitioner was seen by\npolice running a red light in a maroon pickup truck on September 17, 2020. When the\nofficer attempted a traffic stop, petitioner waived his hand out the window and yelled,\n\u201c\u2018no brakes.\u2019\u201d A chase ensued, petitioner fled the vehicle and hid, but officers found him\nand arrested him after he initially resisted.\n       After a preliminary hearing was held, an information was filed on October 29,\n2020, alleging (1) felony evading a police officer under Vehicle Code section 2800.2;\n\n\n3       The background facts in both matters are taken from the preliminary examination hearing\ntranscripts. These facts have not been proven or admitted.\n\n\n                                                3.\n\f(2) resisting or obstructing a police officer in violation of section 148, subdivision (a)(1);\nand (3) driving without a license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500,\nsubdivision (a), a misdemeanor. An enhancement was alleged as to count 1 for\ncommitting an offense while on bail under section 12022.1, and prior felony strikes were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law.\nIII.   Mental Health Diversion Requested and Denied in Both Cases\n       A.     Medical Evaluation\n       On March 25, 2021, petitioner underwent a psychological evaluation with\nDr. Musacco. Dr. Musacco was provided Bakersfield Police Department records,\npetitioner\u2019s prior evaluations for competency to stand trial, mental health records from\nCalifornia Correctional Health Care Services, and petitioner\u2019s criminal rap sheet.\n       Following the evaluation, Dr. Musacco diagnosed petitioner with (1) stimulant use\ndisorder, in remission in a controlled environment; (2) unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum disorder; (3) borderline intellectual functioning; and (4) ASPD. The ASPD\ndiagnosis was based upon petitioner\u2019s criminal behaviors that Dr. Musacco characterized\nas occurring throughout petitioner\u2019s adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Musacco opined\npetitioner\u2019s psychosis, drug use disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning\ncontributed to his criminal behaviors, but that petitioner\u2019s ASPD was an \u201cimportant\ncondition contributing to his actions.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[s]ome of the [petitioner\u2019s]\nmental conditions would be responsive to treatment. For example, if the [petitioner]\nsuccessfully participated in a drug treatment program, I believe his functioning would\nsubstantially improve. The [petitioner\u2019s] symptoms of psychosis would also be amenable\nto antipsychotic medications. The [petitioner\u2019s] Borderline Intellectual Functioning\nwould not be amenable to psychiatric treatment per se.\u201d\n       B.     Hearing on Petitioner\u2019s Motions for Mental Health Diversion\n       Supported by Dr. Musacco\u2019s evaluation, petitioner filed a motion seeking mental\nhealth diversion under section 1001.36 in both of his pending criminal cases, and a\n\n                                              4.\n\fhearing on the motions was held on June 22, 2021. The defense called Dr. Musacco as an\nexpert witness, and he gave testimony consistent with his written evaluation. As far as\nhow petitioner\u2019s diagnosed conditions contributed to his criminal conduct, Dr. Musacco\nexplained there was \u201ckind of an accumulative effect amongst these diagnoses,\u201d and that\npetitioner\u2019s three qualifying disorders operated together to significantly contribute to his\ncriminal conduct.\n       Dr. Musacco also explained, however, that it \u201cwould be impossible to subtract out\nthe influence of an [ASPD] here, and that\u2019s why I referenced it early on as an important\ncondition, which I believe has pervasive impact on his functioning. Also saying that it is\nalso a condition that does not qualify for Diversion. So[,] I don\u2019t think that there is\u2014you\nknow, each [of] these conditions have\u2014they are interrelated, and I don\u2019t [think] there is a\nway to entirely pull one string apart from the other and get a\u2014be able to say, you know,\nfor example, his drug use disorder didn\u2019t play a role in this\u2014in his behavior. I don\u2019t\nthink I could do that, and I don\u2019t think I could do that on an [ASPD] as well. They are all\ntangled up.\u201d\n       The court questioned Dr. Musacco during the hearing as well:\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I understand this. The 4\n       diagnos[e]s you offer, you can\u2019t separate any one of those out?\n\n             \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Well, I can separate A[S]PD \u2026 for this\n       purpose because it\u2019s excluded. We\u2019ve got to say I can\u2019t consider that.\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: But if\u2014here is what I\u2019m getting at .\u2026 If they\n       exclude someone with [ASPD] if that\u2019s all he had, he would be excluded?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Absolutely.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: But he has these 3 other diagnos[e]s. How does the\n       fact he has one of them, the [ASPD], does that mean he\u2019s not eligible\n       because he has it and the doctor can\u2019t exclude that as a factor in his\n       behavior, or can the Court rule well, he\u2019s got these other diagnos[e]s. Can I\n       ignore the A[S]PD .\u2026? Can I exclude that? I don\u2019t think\u2014Doctor, what I\n       hear you say is these are all intermixed?\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I believe so, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: So[,] let me ask you this. Does his [ASPD] [a]ffect\n       his decisions in using illegal drugs, s[t]imulants such as methamphetamine?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I would say, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: And then. Okay. Is there \u2026 is one of these\u2014any\n       one of these 4 predominant do you think or just all intermixed?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I think it is day-by-day, hour-by-hour. But the\n       Borderline Intellectual Functioning and [ASPD] are both, they are kind of\n       steady ongoing issues. They don\u2019t spike or plateau the way the substance\n       use disorder would or the [p]sychosis would. So\u2014so his personality\n       disorder is an ingrained chronic condition that we wouldn\u2019t expect again\n       based on the eval[uation]. Same with Borderline Intellectual Functioning,\n       he\u2019s not going to get smarter or less smart[] day 1 to day 2. But if he\u2019s\n       using drugs \u2026 or hearing v[o]ices, we can anticipate that his function will\n       decline due to those added stressor[s]. So again, it is kind of a\u2014it is like a\n       ball [of] string and you pull one out, but you can\u2019t entirely separate it from\n       the ball as you have it.\u201d\n       When asked on redirect to characterize ASPD, Dr. Musacco explained the\ndiagnosis for ASPD is characterized as \u201ca pattern of criminal behavior, ignoring rules, or\nbeing willing to violate rules, neglecting obligations. You know, when we think about a\ntypical person who is a revolving door of prison in jail, a vast\u2014well, at least a majority\nof those persons have [ASPD]. Meaning, they have characteristically violated rules and\n[norms] and expectations to their detriment and the detriment of those around them.\u201d\n       C.      Denial of Diversion and Petitioner\u2019s Writ Petitions\n       The court denied the motions for diversion, noting Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion that\npetitioner\u2019s qualifying disorders were all interrelated with his ASPD. The court ruled\npetitioner is statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under section 1001.36\nbecause he suffers from ASPD, an excluded condition. The court explained that although\npetitioner has three other eligible conditions, the fourth diagnosis for ASPD operated as a\nbar to eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate in both underlying cases to vacate\nthe court\u2019s order and grant his motions for admission into a mental health diversion\nprogram under section 1001.36.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that he suffers from qualifying mental health\ndisorders under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), which the court acknowledged. According to\npetitioner, the fact that he also suffers from ASPD does not make him per se ineligible for\ndiversion under section 1001.36, and the court erred in concluding otherwise. Moreover,\npetitioner maintains, he has satisfied all of the requirements for diversion under\nsection 1001.36 and his motions for diversion should be granted.\n       The Attorney General filed responses to the petitions on behalf of the People, the\nreal party in interest. The Attorney General agrees that the trial court erred in denying\ndiversion on the ground petitioner suffers from ASPD\u2014the fact petitioner has been\ndiagnosed with an excluded mental disorder does not bar him completely from diversion\nwhen he also suffers from other qualified mental health disorders. Moreover, according\nto the Attorney General, the court\u2019s order did not address whether petitioner\u2019s qualifying\nmental disorders were a significant factor in the charged offenses and whether the mental\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior would respond to treatment. (See \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B) & (C).) The Attorney General urges this court to grant the petition for a\nwrit of mandate, vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion, and remand for another\nhearing to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for diversion.\nI.     Mental Health Diversion Under Section 1001.36\n       Effective June 27, 2018, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for\ndefendants with diagnosed and qualifying mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (a).) One of the stated\npurposes of the legislation was to promote \u201c[i]ncreased diversion of individuals with\nmental disorders \u2026 while protecting public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.35, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              7.\n\f          \u201c\u2018[P]retrial diversion\u2019 means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily\nor permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is\ncharged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health\ntreatment .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the defendant has performed satisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial\ndiversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n          \u201cOn an accusatory pleading alleging the commission of a misdemeanor or felony\noffense, the court may, after considering the positions of the defense and prosecution,\ngrant pretrial diversion \u2026 if the defendant meets all of the requirements .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (a).) There are six requirements. (Id., subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(F).)\n          First, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant suffers from a mental disorder\nas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder shall be provided by\nthe defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, the court must also be \u201csatisfied that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was\na significant factor in the commission of the charged offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B).) \u201cA court may conclude that a defendant\u2019s mental disorder was a\nsignificant factor in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any\nrelevant and credible evidence, \u2026 the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder substantially contributed to the defendant\u2019s involvement in the commission of\nthe offense.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\f       Third, \u201ca qualified mental health expert\u201d must opine that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to\nmental health treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Fourth, subject to certain exceptions, the defendant must consent to diversion and\nwaive his or her right to a speedy trial. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(D).) Fifth, the defendant\nmust agree \u201cto comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1)(E).)\n       Finally, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant will not pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety \u2026 if treated in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(F).)\n       If a trial court determines that a defendant meets the six requirements, then the\ncourt must also determine whether \u201cthe recommended inpatient or outpatient program of\nmental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the\ndefendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(1)(A).) The court may then grant diversion and refer\nthe defendant to an approved treatment program. (Id., subd. (c)(1)(B).) \u201cThe period\nduring which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no\nlonger than two years.\u201d (Id., subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant commits additional crimes,\nor otherwise performs unsatisfactorily in diversion, then the court may reinstate criminal\nproceedings. (Id., subd. (d).) However, if the defendant performs \u201csatisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings .\u2026\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n       The Legislature amended section 1001.36 a few months after it was enacted \u201cto\nspecify that defendants charged with certain crimes, such as murder and rape, are\nineligible for diversion.\u201d (People v. Frahs (2020) 9 Cal.5th 618, 627; see \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(2).)\nII.    Mental Health Diversion Eligibility Under Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\n       Among other mandatory prerequisites, diversion may be granted if a defendant\nestablishes under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that he or she \u201csuffers from a mental disorder\n\n                                             9.\n\fas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).)\n       The central question presented is whether a diagnosis for ASPD\u2014an excluded\ndisorder\u2014renders petitioner statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) even though the court concluded petitioner has three other\nqualifying mental health disorders.\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A trial court\u2019s factual findings under section 1001.36 must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and the court\u2019s diversion eligibility determinations are reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion. (People v. Oneal (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 581, 588\u2013589 [reviewing\nunder abuse of discretion standard whether the defendant\u2019s disorder played a significant\nrole in the commission of charged offense]; People v. Moine (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 440,\n448\u2013449 [whether the defendant posed unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if\ntreated in the community reviewed for abuse of discretion].)\n       The question posed here, however, is one that turns on an issue of statutory\ninterpretation and the application of that statute to undisputed facts: whether a person\ndiagnosed with both qualifying and excluded mental health disorders is statutorily\nineligible for diversion under the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Our review of\nthis issue is de novo. (People v. Prunty (2015) 62 Cal.4th 59, 71 [statutory\ninterpretation]; People v. Chubbuck (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1, 7 [application of statute to\nundisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review].)\n       B.     Petitioner is Not Statutorily Ineligible for Diversion\n       Petitioner and the Attorney General maintain section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not\nestablish a bar to diversion based on the presence of an excluded disorder, such as ASPD.\nThey argue section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) merely limits the types of disorders a defendant\n\n                                            10.\n\fmay use to carry his or her burden of establishing a qualifying disorder. In other words, a\ndefendant satisfies section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) so long as he or she suffers from a\nqualifying disorder, even if he or she is also diagnosed with an excluded disorder.\nAccording to petitioner and the Attorney General, the trial court improperly treated\npetitioner\u2019s ASPD diagnosis as a bar to diversion rather than simply recognizing that this\ndiagnosis could not be used to satisfy the requirement of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n       The trial court obviously interpreted section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) differently and\nconcluded that petitioner is statutorily ineligible for diversion, regardless of his other\nqualifying mental disorders, because he suffers from ASPD\u2014an excluded disorder. The\ntrial court is not alone in interpreting the statute to entirely preclude diversion for those\ndefendants who suffer from an excluded disorder listed in section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). As\none treatise has noted, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the statute suggests the Legislature\nintended to exclude persons with [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and\npedophilia, whether the person also suffers from other, qualified disorders.\u201d (Couzens et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2021) \u00a7 7:22).)\n       Despite these differing interpretations of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the language\nstrikes us as unambiguous. Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires the defendant to establish\nhe or she suffers from \u201ca mental disorder\u201d identified in the most recent edition of the\nDSM and then provides a nonexhaustive list of included disorders that suffice, followed\nby a list of excluded disorders that do not. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A), italics added.) Listing\nincluded and excluded disorders in this format simply articulates which disorders may\nand may not serve to prove the defendant has at least one qualifying mental disorder.\n       It is entirely predictable, and thus certainly within the contemplation of the\nLegislature, that a person might suffer from included and excluded disorders. Because\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires suffering only one included disorder, the Legislature\nwould have been aware a defendant could still meet that requirement notwithstanding\nsuffering from a disorder section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) designates as excluded. Had the\n\n                                              11.\n\fLegislature intended to wholly preclude from diversion any person diagnosed with an\nexcluded disorder (regardless of concurrently suffering from included disorders), the\nsentence phrasing of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) would have shifted from simply listing\nexcluded disorders to disqualifying persons with any of the excluded disorders.\n       But even assuming the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) was ambiguous in\nthis regard, the result is no different. One of the stated purposes of title 6, part 2,\nchapter 2.8A of the Penal Code, of which section 1001.36 is a part, is to increase\ndiversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals\u2019 entry and\nreentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. (\u00a7 1001.35,\nsubd. (a).) This purpose militates an interpretation of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that\nfosters more inclusivity in diversion eligibility, not less. Wholly eliminating diversion\neligibility for defendants who suffer from qualifying disorders because they also suffer\nfrom an excluded disorder does not further this purpose. 4 Rather, it potentially excludes\na wide swath of defendants who otherwise suffer from qualifying disorders that could be\namenable to treatment, and whose entry and reentry into the criminal justice system\nmight be mitigated. (See People v. Cornett (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265 [if statute is\nambiguous, courts may consider other aids such as the statute\u2019s purpose].)\nSection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) simply disallows defendants from establishing eligibility for\ndiversion based on an excluded disorder. Suffering from an excluded disorder does not\ncategorically bar defendants from establishing eligibility based on a different, qualifying\ndisorder.\n       We conclude that because petitioner suffered from eligible, qualifying mental\ndisorders that the court accepted as proven, petitioner\u2019s additional diagnosis for ASPD,\n\n4       At the hearing, Dr. Musacco estimated \u201cat least a majority\u201d of incarcerated persons suffer\nfrom ASPD. It is not clear whether that estimate is based on the diagnostic criteria of ASPD laid\nout in the most recent edition of the DSM, but it underscores how eliminating all eligibility for\nthose suffering from ASPD and other included mental conditions would likely have an expansive\nexcluding effect.\n\n\n                                               12.\n\fan excluded disorder, did not render him statutorily ineligible under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Denial of diversion eligibility merely because of the existence\nof an excluded disorder was incorrect.\nIII.   A New Diversion Eligibility Hearing is Required\n       As the trial court rested its denial of diversion on ineligibility under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the court did not consider the remaining diversion eligibility\nprerequisites. For example, the court did not consider whether the qualified disorders\nwere significant factors in the commission of the offenses and whether the qualified\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior were treatable. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(B) & (C).)\nThese determinations may be more difficult with diagnoses for included and excluded\ndisorders. Dr. Musacco explained he had considered petitioner\u2019s qualifying mental\ndisorders in isolation from his ASPD, but he acknowledged he could not neatly separate\npetitioner\u2019s behavior by disorder\u2014one disorder might exacerbate others and together\ncause a behavioral function decline. In the context of Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion, the trial\ncourt alluded to the complexity of assessing which disorder contributed to petitioner\u2019s\ncriminal conduct and whether that disorder would respond to treatment. A new eligibility\nhearing is required for the court to consider these and all other remaining eligibility\nprerequisites under section 1001.36(b)(1).\n       We express no opinion how the trial court should evaluate the remaining eligibility\nrequirements, including the interrelationship among included and excluded disorders for\nthe purposes of section 1001.36, subdivision (b)(1)(B) and (C), or whether petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for diversion should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of mandate is granted as follows: the trial court\u2019s\norder denying diversion is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a new hearing in\naccordance with this opinion on petitioner\u2019s motion for mental health diversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              MEEHAN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nSMITH, Acting P.

We conclude\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not wholly preclude from diversion defendants who suffer\nfrom both excluded and included mental health disorders; section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\nrequires only that a defendant suffers from one qualified mental health disorder. The trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of diversion was incorrect under our interpretation of the\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the trial court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for\na new eligibility hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for diversion under section 1001.36.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n       Petitioner has two pending criminal cases. Petitioner filed a motion for mental\nhealth diversion in both cases, a hearing was held on June 22, 2021, and the trial court\ndenied the motions on the ground petitioner was statutorily ineligible for diversion\nbecause his ASPD diagnosis is an excluded disorder under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless indicated otherwise.\n2       We use the term \u201cqualifying\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d interchangeably to describe disorders that\nare identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM) and are not expressly excluded by section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                                2.\n\f(See \u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in both cases to\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion.\nI.     Kern Superior Court Case No. BF180104A\n       On February 18, 2020, police officers witnessed a driver, later identified as\npetitioner, crashing into another car. A traffic stop was attempted, but petitioner refused\nto stop and led police on a chase that lasted several miles. Police ultimately subdued and\narrested him. The driver whose car petitioner crashed into said she had been rammed by\npetitioner\u2019s blue pickup truck three times, tried to move out of the way of the truck, but\npetitioner blocked her from doing so, and then petitioner\u2019s blue truck hit her car\u2019s\npassenger side. 3\n       Following a preliminary examination, an information was filed on March 6, 2020,\nwhich alleged two felony counts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon (a car) under\nsection 245, subdivision (a)(1) and (2) felony evasion of a peace officer in violation of\nVehicle Code section 2800.2. As to each count, two prior felony convictions were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)) and\nalleged to be serious prior felonies under section 667, subdivision (a).\nII.    Kern Superior Court Case No. BF182498A\n       While the first case was pending, a driver later identified as petitioner was seen by\npolice running a red light in a maroon pickup truck on September 17, 2020. When the\nofficer attempted a traffic stop, petitioner waived his hand out the window and yelled,\n\u201c\u2018no brakes.\u2019\u201d A chase ensued, petitioner fled the vehicle and hid, but officers found him\nand arrested him after he initially resisted.\n       After a preliminary hearing was held, an information was filed on October 29,\n2020, alleging (1) felony evading a police officer under Vehicle Code section 2800.2;\n\n\n3       The background facts in both matters are taken from the preliminary examination hearing\ntranscripts. These facts have not been proven or admitted.\n\n\n                                                3.\n\f(2) resisting or obstructing a police officer in violation of section 148, subdivision (a)(1);\nand (3) driving without a license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500,\nsubdivision (a), a misdemeanor. An enhancement was alleged as to count 1 for\ncommitting an offense while on bail under section 12022.1, and prior felony strikes were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law.\nIII.   Mental Health Diversion Requested and Denied in Both Cases\n       A.     Medical Evaluation\n       On March 25, 2021, petitioner underwent a psychological evaluation with\nDr. Musacco. Dr. Musacco was provided Bakersfield Police Department records,\npetitioner\u2019s prior evaluations for competency to stand trial, mental health records from\nCalifornia Correctional Health Care Services, and petitioner\u2019s criminal rap sheet.\n       Following the evaluation, Dr. Musacco diagnosed petitioner with (1) stimulant use\ndisorder, in remission in a controlled environment; (2) unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum disorder; (3) borderline intellectual functioning; and (4) ASPD. The ASPD\ndiagnosis was based upon petitioner\u2019s criminal behaviors that Dr. Musacco characterized\nas occurring throughout petitioner\u2019s adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Musacco opined\npetitioner\u2019s psychosis, drug use disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning\ncontributed to his criminal behaviors, but that petitioner\u2019s ASPD was an \u201cimportant\ncondition contributing to his actions.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[s]ome of the [petitioner\u2019s]\nmental conditions would be responsive to treatment. For example, if the [petitioner]\nsuccessfully participated in a drug treatment program, I believe his functioning would\nsubstantially improve. The [petitioner\u2019s] symptoms of psychosis would also be amenable\nto antipsychotic medications. The [petitioner\u2019s] Borderline Intellectual Functioning\nwould not be amenable to psychiatric treatment per se.\u201d\n       B.     Hearing on Petitioner\u2019s Motions for Mental Health Diversion\n       Supported by Dr. Musacco\u2019s evaluation, petitioner filed a motion seeking mental\nhealth diversion under section 1001.36 in both of his pending criminal cases, and a\n\n                                              4.\n\fhearing on the motions was held on June 22, 2021. The defense called Dr. Musacco as an\nexpert witness, and he gave testimony consistent with his written evaluation. As far as\nhow petitioner\u2019s diagnosed conditions contributed to his criminal conduct, Dr. Musacco\nexplained there was \u201ckind of an accumulative effect amongst these diagnoses,\u201d and that\npetitioner\u2019s three qualifying disorders operated together to significantly contribute to his\ncriminal conduct.\n       Dr. Musacco also explained, however, that it \u201cwould be impossible to subtract out\nthe influence of an [ASPD] here, and that\u2019s why I referenced it early on as an important\ncondition, which I believe has pervasive impact on his functioning. Also saying that it is\nalso a condition that does not qualify for Diversion. So[,] I don\u2019t think that there is\u2014you\nknow, each [of] these conditions have\u2014they are interrelated, and I don\u2019t [think] there is a\nway to entirely pull one string apart from the other and get a\u2014be able to say, you know,\nfor example, his drug use disorder didn\u2019t play a role in this\u2014in his behavior. I don\u2019t\nthink I could do that, and I don\u2019t think I could do that on an [ASPD] as well. They are all\ntangled up.\u201d\n       The court questioned Dr. Musacco during the hearing as well:\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I understand this. The 4\n       diagnos[e]s you offer, you can\u2019t separate any one of those out?\n\n             \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Well, I can separate A[S]PD \u2026 for this\n       purpose because it\u2019s excluded. We\u2019ve got to say I can\u2019t consider that.\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: But if\u2014here is what I\u2019m getting at .\u2026 If they\n       exclude someone with [ASPD] if that\u2019s all he had, he would be excluded?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Absolutely.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: But he has these 3 other diagnos[e]s. How does the\n       fact he has one of them, the [ASPD], does that mean he\u2019s not eligible\n       because he has it and the doctor can\u2019t exclude that as a factor in his\n       behavior, or can the Court rule well, he\u2019s got these other diagnos[e]s. Can I\n       ignore the A[S]PD .\u2026? Can I exclude that? I don\u2019t think\u2014Doctor, what I\n       hear you say is these are all intermixed?\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I believe so, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: So[,] let me ask you this. Does his [ASPD] [a]ffect\n       his decisions in using illegal drugs, s[t]imulants such as methamphetamine?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I would say, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: And then. Okay. Is there \u2026 is one of these\u2014any\n       one of these 4 predominant do you think or just all intermixed?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I think it is day-by-day, hour-by-hour. But the\n       Borderline Intellectual Functioning and [ASPD] are both, they are kind of\n       steady ongoing issues. They don\u2019t spike or plateau the way the substance\n       use disorder would or the [p]sychosis would. So\u2014so his personality\n       disorder is an ingrained chronic condition that we wouldn\u2019t expect again\n       based on the eval[uation]. Same with Borderline Intellectual Functioning,\n       he\u2019s not going to get smarter or less smart[] day 1 to day 2. But if he\u2019s\n       using drugs \u2026 or hearing v[o]ices, we can anticipate that his function will\n       decline due to those added stressor[s]. So again, it is kind of a\u2014it is like a\n       ball [of] string and you pull one out, but you can\u2019t entirely separate it from\n       the ball as you have it.\u201d\n       When asked on redirect to characterize ASPD, Dr. Musacco explained the\ndiagnosis for ASPD is characterized as \u201ca pattern of criminal behavior, ignoring rules, or\nbeing willing to violate rules, neglecting obligations. You know, when we think about a\ntypical person who is a revolving door of prison in jail, a vast\u2014well, at least a majority\nof those persons have [ASPD]. Meaning, they have characteristically violated rules and\n[norms] and expectations to their detriment and the detriment of those around them.\u201d\n       C.      Denial of Diversion and Petitioner\u2019s Writ Petitions\n       The court denied the motions for diversion, noting Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion that\npetitioner\u2019s qualifying disorders were all interrelated with his ASPD. The court ruled\npetitioner is statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under section 1001.36\nbecause he suffers from ASPD, an excluded condition. The court explained that although\npetitioner has three other eligible conditions, the fourth diagnosis for ASPD operated as a\nbar to eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate in both underlying cases to vacate\nthe court\u2019s order and grant his motions for admission into a mental health diversion\nprogram under section 1001.36.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that he suffers from qualifying mental health\ndisorders under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), which the court acknowledged. According to\npetitioner, the fact that he also suffers from ASPD does not make him per se ineligible for\ndiversion under section 1001.36, and the court erred in concluding otherwise. Moreover,\npetitioner maintains, he has satisfied all of the requirements for diversion under\nsection 1001.36 and his motions for diversion should be granted.\n       The Attorney General filed responses to the petitions on behalf of the People, the\nreal party in interest. The Attorney General agrees that the trial court erred in denying\ndiversion on the ground petitioner suffers from ASPD\u2014the fact petitioner has been\ndiagnosed with an excluded mental disorder does not bar him completely from diversion\nwhen he also suffers from other qualified mental health disorders. Moreover, according\nto the Attorney General, the court\u2019s order did not address whether petitioner\u2019s qualifying\nmental disorders were a significant factor in the charged offenses and whether the mental\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior would respond to treatment. (See \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B) & (C).) The Attorney General urges this court to grant the petition for a\nwrit of mandate, vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion, and remand for another\nhearing to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for diversion.\nI.     Mental Health Diversion Under Section 1001.36\n       Effective June 27, 2018, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for\ndefendants with diagnosed and qualifying mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (a).) One of the stated\npurposes of the legislation was to promote \u201c[i]ncreased diversion of individuals with\nmental disorders \u2026 while protecting public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.35, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              7.\n\f          \u201c\u2018[P]retrial diversion\u2019 means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily\nor permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is\ncharged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health\ntreatment .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the defendant has performed satisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial\ndiversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n          \u201cOn an accusatory pleading alleging the commission of a misdemeanor or felony\noffense, the court may, after considering the positions of the defense and prosecution,\ngrant pretrial diversion \u2026 if the defendant meets all of the requirements .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (a).) There are six requirements. (Id., subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(F).)\n          First, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant suffers from a mental disorder\nas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder shall be provided by\nthe defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, the court must also be \u201csatisfied that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was\na significant factor in the commission of the charged offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B).) \u201cA court may conclude that a defendant\u2019s mental disorder was a\nsignificant factor in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any\nrelevant and credible evidence, \u2026 the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder substantially contributed to the defendant\u2019s involvement in the commission of\nthe offense.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\f       Third, \u201ca qualified mental health expert\u201d must opine that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to\nmental health treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Fourth, subject to certain exceptions, the defendant must consent to diversion and\nwaive his or her right to a speedy trial. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(D).) Fifth, the defendant\nmust agree \u201cto comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1)(E).)\n       Finally, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant will not pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety \u2026 if treated in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(F).)\n       If a trial court determines that a defendant meets the six requirements, then the\ncourt must also determine whether \u201cthe recommended inpatient or outpatient program of\nmental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the\ndefendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(1)(A).) The court may then grant diversion and refer\nthe defendant to an approved treatment program. (Id., subd. (c)(1)(B).) \u201cThe period\nduring which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no\nlonger than two years.\u201d (Id., subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant commits additional crimes,\nor otherwise performs unsatisfactorily in diversion, then the court may reinstate criminal\nproceedings. (Id., subd. (d).)

Our review of\nthis issue is de novo. (People v. Prunty (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">62 Cal.4th 59</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 [statutory\ninterpretation]; People v.

Petitioner is Not Statutorily Ineligible for Diversion\n       Petitioner and the Attorney General maintain section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not\nestablish a bar to diversion based on the presence of an excluded disorder, such as ASPD.\nThey argue section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) merely limits the types of disorders a defendant\n\n                                            10.\n\fmay use to carry his or her burden of establishing a qualifying disorder. In other words, a\ndefendant satisfies section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) so long as he or she suffers from a\nqualifying disorder, even if he or she is also diagnosed with an excluded disorder.\nAccording to petitioner and the Attorney General, the trial court improperly treated\npetitioner\u2019s ASPD diagnosis as a bar to diversion rather than simply recognizing that this\ndiagnosis could not be used to satisfy the requirement of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n       The trial court obviously interpreted section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) differently and\nconcluded that petitioner is statutorily ineligible for diversion, regardless of his other\nqualifying mental disorders, because he suffers from ASPD\u2014an excluded disorder. The\ntrial court is not alone in interpreting the statute to entirely preclude diversion for those\ndefendants who suffer from an excluded disorder listed in section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). As\none treatise has noted, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the statute suggests the Legislature\nintended to exclude persons with [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and\npedophilia, whether the person also suffers from other, qualified disorders.\u201d (Couzens et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2021) \u00a7 7:22).)\n       Despite these differing interpretations of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the language\nstrikes us as unambiguous. Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires the defendant to establish\nhe or she suffers from \u201ca mental disorder\u201d identified in the most recent edition of the\nDSM and then provides a nonexhaustive list of included disorders that suffice, followed\nby a list of excluded disorders that do not. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A), italics added.) Listing\nincluded and excluded disorders in this format simply articulates which disorders may\nand may not serve to prove the defendant has at least one qualifying mental disorder.\n       It is entirely predictable, and thus certainly within the contemplation of the\nLegislature, that a person might suffer from included and excluded disorders. Because\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires suffering only one included disorder, the Legislature\nwould have been aware a defendant could still meet that requirement notwithstanding\nsuffering from a disorder section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) designates as excluded. Had the\n\n                                              11.\n\fLegislature intended to wholly preclude from diversion any person diagnosed with an\nexcluded disorder (regardless of concurrently suffering from included disorders), the\nsentence phrasing of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) would have shifted from simply listing\nexcluded disorders to disqualifying persons with any of the excluded disorders.\n       But even assuming the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) was ambiguous in\nthis regard, the result is no different. One of the stated purposes of title 6, part 2,\nchapter 2.8A of the Penal Code, of which section 1001.36 is a part, is to increase\ndiversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals\u2019 entry and\nreentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. (\u00a7 1001.35,\nsubd. (a).) This purpose militates an interpretation of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that\nfosters more inclusivity in diversion eligibility, not less. Wholly eliminating diversion\neligibility for defendants who suffer from qualifying disorders because they also suffer\nfrom an excluded disorder does not further this purpose. 4 Rather, it potentially excludes\na wide swath of defendants who otherwise suffer from qualifying disorders that could be\namenable to treatment, and whose entry and reentry into the criminal justice system\nmight be mitigated. (See People v. Cornett (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">53 Cal.4th 1261</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265 [if statute is\nambiguous, courts may consider other aids such as the statute\u2019s purpose].)\nSection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) simply disallows defendants from establishing eligibility for\ndiversion based on an excluded disorder. Suffering from an excluded disorder does not\ncategorically bar defendants from establishing eligibility based on a different, qualifying\ndisorder.\n       We conclude that because petitioner suffered from eligible, qualifying mental\ndisorders that the court accepted as proven, petitioner\u2019s additional diagnosis for ASPD,\n\n4       At the hearing, Dr. Musacco estimated \u201cat least a majority\u201d of incarcerated persons suffer\nfrom ASPD. It is not clear whether that estimate is based on the diagnostic criteria of ASPD laid\nout in the most recent edition of the DSM, but it underscores how eliminating all eligibility for\nthose suffering from ASPD and other included mental conditions would likely have an expansive\nexcluding effect.\n\n\n                                               12.\n\fan excluded disorder, did not render him statutorily ineligible under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Denial of diversion eligibility merely because of the existence\nof an excluded disorder was incorrect.\nIII.   A New Diversion Eligibility Hearing is Required\n       As the trial court rested its denial of diversion on ineligibility under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the court did not consider the remaining diversion eligibility\nprerequisites. For example, the court did not consider whether the qualified disorders\nwere significant factors in the commission of the offenses and whether the qualified\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior were treatable. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(B) & (C).)\nThese determinations may be more difficult with diagnoses for included and excluded\ndisorders. Dr. Musacco explained he had considered petitioner\u2019s qualifying mental\ndisorders in isolation from his ASPD, but he acknowledged he could not neatly separate\npetitioner\u2019s behavior by disorder\u2014one disorder might exacerbate others and together\ncause a behavioral function decline. In the context of Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion, the trial\ncourt alluded to the complexity of assessing which disorder contributed to petitioner\u2019s\ncriminal conduct and whether that disorder would respond to treatment. A new eligibility\nhearing is required for the court to consider these and all other remaining eligibility\nprerequisites under section 1001.36(b)(1).\n       We express no opinion how the trial court should evaluate the remaining eligibility\nrequirements, including the interrelationship among included and excluded disorders for\nthe purposes of section 1001.36, subdivision (b)(1)(B) and (C), or whether petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for diversion should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of mandate is granted as follows: the trial court\u2019s\norder denying diversion is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a new hearing in\naccordance with this opinion on petitioner\u2019s motion for mental health diversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              MEEHAN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nSMITH, Acting P.

We conclude\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not wholly preclude from diversion defendants who suffer\nfrom both excluded and included mental health disorders; section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\nrequires only that a defendant suffers from one qualified mental health disorder. The trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of diversion was incorrect under our interpretation of the\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the trial court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for\na new eligibility hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for diversion under section 1001.36.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n       Petitioner has two pending criminal cases. Petitioner filed a motion for mental\nhealth diversion in both cases, a hearing was held on June 22, 2021, and the trial court\ndenied the motions on the ground petitioner was statutorily ineligible for diversion\nbecause his ASPD diagnosis is an excluded disorder under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless indicated otherwise.\n2       We use the term \u201cqualifying\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d interchangeably to describe disorders that\nare identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM) and are not expressly excluded by section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                                2.\n\f(See \u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in both cases to\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion.\nI.     Kern Superior Court Case No. BF180104A\n       On February 18, 2020, police officers witnessed a driver, later identified as\npetitioner, crashing into another car. A traffic stop was attempted, but petitioner refused\nto stop and led police on a chase that lasted several miles. Police ultimately subdued and\narrested him. The driver whose car petitioner crashed into said she had been rammed by\npetitioner\u2019s blue pickup truck three times, tried to move out of the way of the truck, but\npetitioner blocked her from doing so, and then petitioner\u2019s blue truck hit her car\u2019s\npassenger side.3\n       Following a preliminary examination, an information was filed on March 6, 2020,\nwhich alleged two felony counts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon (a car) under\nsection 245, subdivision (a)(1) and (2) felony evasion of a peace officer in violation of\nVehicle Code section 2800.2. As to each count, two prior felony convictions were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)) and\nalleged to be serious prior felonies under section 667, subdivision (a).\nII.    Kern Superior Court Case No. BF182498A\n       While the first case was pending, a driver later identified as petitioner was seen by\npolice running a red light in a maroon pickup truck on September 17, 2020. When the\nofficer attempted a traffic stop, petitioner waived his hand out the window and yelled,\n\u201c\u2018no brakes.\u2019\u201d A chase ensued, petitioner fled the vehicle and hid, but officers found him\nand arrested him after he initially resisted.\n       After a preliminary hearing was held, an information was filed on October 29,\n2020, alleging (1) felony evading a police officer under Vehicle Code section 2800.2;\n\n\n3       The background facts in both matters are taken from the preliminary examination hearing\ntranscripts. These facts have not been proven or admitted.\n\n\n                                                3.\n\f(2) resisting or obstructing a police officer in violation of section 148, subdivision (a)(1);\nand (3) driving without a license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500,\nsubdivision (a), a misdemeanor. An enhancement was alleged as to count 1 for\ncommitting an offense while on bail under section 12022.1, and prior felony strikes were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law.\nIII.   Mental Health Diversion Requested and Denied in Both Cases\n       A.     Medical Evaluation\n       On March 25, 2021, petitioner underwent a psychological evaluation with\nDr. Musacco. Dr. Musacco was provided Bakersfield Police Department records,\npetitioner\u2019s prior evaluations for competency to stand trial, mental health records from\nCalifornia Correctional Health Care Services, and petitioner\u2019s criminal rap sheet.\n       Following the evaluation, Dr. Musacco diagnosed petitioner with (1) stimulant use\ndisorder, in remission in a controlled environment; (2) unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum disorder; (3) borderline intellectual functioning; and (4) ASPD. The ASPD\ndiagnosis was based upon petitioner\u2019s criminal behaviors that Dr. Musacco characterized\nas occurring throughout petitioner\u2019s adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Musacco opined\npetitioner\u2019s psychosis, drug use disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning\ncontributed to his criminal behaviors, but that petitioner\u2019s ASPD was an \u201cimportant\ncondition contributing to his actions.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[s]ome of the [petitioner\u2019s]\nmental conditions would be responsive to treatment. For example, if the [petitioner]\nsuccessfully participated in a drug treatment program, I believe his functioning would\nsubstantially improve. The [petitioner\u2019s] symptoms of psychosis would also be amenable\nto antipsychotic medications. The [petitioner\u2019s] Borderline Intellectual Functioning\nwould not be amenable to psychiatric treatment per se.\u201d\n       B.     Hearing on Petitioner\u2019s Motions for Mental Health Diversion\n       Supported by Dr. Musacco\u2019s evaluation, petitioner filed a motion seeking mental\nhealth diversion under section 1001.36 in both of his pending criminal cases, and a\n\n                                              4.\n\fhearing on the motions was held on June 22, 2021. The defense called Dr. Musacco as an\nexpert witness, and he gave testimony consistent with his written evaluation. As far as\nhow petitioner\u2019s diagnosed conditions contributed to his criminal conduct, Dr. Musacco\nexplained there was \u201ckind of an accumulative effect amongst these diagnoses,\u201d and that\npetitioner\u2019s three qualifying disorders operated together to significantly contribute to his\ncriminal conduct.\n       Dr. Musacco also explained, however, that it \u201cwould be impossible to subtract out\nthe influence of an [ASPD] here, and that\u2019s why I referenced it early on as an important\ncondition, which I believe has pervasive impact on his functioning. Also saying that it is\nalso a condition that does not qualify for Diversion. So[,] I don\u2019t think that there is\u2014you\nknow, each [of] these conditions have\u2014they are interrelated, and I don\u2019t [think] there is a\nway to entirely pull one string apart from the other and get a\u2014be able to say, you know,\nfor example, his drug use disorder didn\u2019t play a role in this\u2014in his behavior. I don\u2019t\nthink I could do that, and I don\u2019t think I could do that on an [ASPD] as well. They are all\ntangled up.\u201d\n       The court questioned Dr. Musacco during the hearing as well:\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I understand this. The 4\n       diagnos[e]s you offer, you can\u2019t separate any one of those out?\n\n             \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Well, I can separate A[S]PD \u2026 for this\n       purpose because it\u2019s excluded. We\u2019ve got to say I can\u2019t consider that.\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: But if\u2014here is what I\u2019m getting at .\u2026 If they\n       exclude someone with [ASPD] if that\u2019s all he had, he would be excluded?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Absolutely.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: But he has these 3 other diagnos[e]s. How does the\n       fact he has one of them, the [ASPD], does that mean he\u2019s not eligible\n       because he has it and the doctor can\u2019t exclude that as a factor in his\n       behavior, or can the Court rule well, he\u2019s got these other diagnos[e]s. Can I\n       ignore the A[S]PD .\u2026? Can I exclude that? I don\u2019t think\u2014Doctor, what I\n       hear you say is these are all intermixed?\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I believe so, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: So[,] let me ask you this. Does his [ASPD] [a]ffect\n       his decisions in using illegal drugs, s[t]imulants such as methamphetamine?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I would say, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: And then. Okay. Is there \u2026 is one of these\u2014any\n       one of these 4 predominant do you think or just all intermixed?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I think it is day-by-day, hour-by-hour. But the\n       Borderline Intellectual Functioning and [ASPD] are both, they are kind of\n       steady ongoing issues. They don\u2019t spike or plateau the way the substance\n       use disorder would or the [p]sychosis would. So\u2014so his personality\n       disorder is an ingrained chronic condition that we wouldn\u2019t expect again\n       based on the eval[uation]. Same with Borderline Intellectual Functioning,\n       he\u2019s not going to get smarter or less smart[] day 1 to day 2. But if he\u2019s\n       using drugs \u2026 or hearing v[o]ices, we can anticipate that his function will\n       decline due to those added stressor[s]. So again, it is kind of a\u2014it is like a\n       ball [of] string and you pull one out, but you can\u2019t entirely separate it from\n       the ball as you have it.\u201d\n       When asked on redirect to characterize ASPD, Dr. Musacco explained the\ndiagnosis for ASPD is characterized as \u201ca pattern of criminal behavior, ignoring rules, or\nbeing willing to violate rules, neglecting obligations. You know, when we think about a\ntypical person who is a revolving door of prison in jail, a vast\u2014well, at least a majority\nof those persons have [ASPD]. Meaning, they have characteristically violated rules and\n[norms] and expectations to their detriment and the detriment of those around them.\u201d\n       C.      Denial of Diversion and Petitioner\u2019s Writ Petitions\n       The court denied the motions for diversion, noting Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion that\npetitioner\u2019s qualifying disorders were all interrelated with his ASPD. The court ruled\npetitioner is statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under section 1001.36\nbecause he suffers from ASPD, an excluded condition. The court explained that although\npetitioner has three other eligible conditions, the fourth diagnosis for ASPD operated as a\nbar to eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate in both underlying cases to vacate\nthe court\u2019s order and grant his motions for admission into a mental health diversion\nprogram under section 1001.36.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that he suffers from qualifying mental health\ndisorders under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), which the court acknowledged. According to\npetitioner, the fact that he also suffers from ASPD does not make him per se ineligible for\ndiversion under section 1001.36, and the court erred in concluding otherwise. Moreover,\npetitioner maintains, he has satisfied all of the requirements for diversion under\nsection 1001.36 and his motions for diversion should be granted.\n       The Attorney General filed responses to the petitions on behalf of the People, the\nreal party in interest. The Attorney General agrees that the trial court erred in denying\ndiversion on the ground petitioner suffers from ASPD\u2014the fact petitioner has been\ndiagnosed with an excluded mental disorder does not bar him completely from diversion\nwhen he also suffers from other qualified mental health disorders. Moreover, according\nto the Attorney General, the court\u2019s order did not address whether petitioner\u2019s qualifying\nmental disorders were a significant factor in the charged offenses and whether the mental\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior would respond to treatment. (See \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B) & (C).) The Attorney General urges this court to grant the petition for a\nwrit of mandate, vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion, and remand for another\nhearing to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for diversion.\nI.     Mental Health Diversion Under Section 1001.36\n       Effective June 27, 2018, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for\ndefendants with diagnosed and qualifying mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (a).) One of the stated\npurposes of the legislation was to promote \u201c[i]ncreased diversion of individuals with\nmental disorders \u2026 while protecting public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.35, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              7.\n\f          \u201c\u2018[P]retrial diversion\u2019 means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily\nor permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is\ncharged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health\ntreatment .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the defendant has performed satisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial\ndiversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n          \u201cOn an accusatory pleading alleging the commission of a misdemeanor or felony\noffense, the court may, after considering the positions of the defense and prosecution,\ngrant pretrial diversion \u2026 if the defendant meets all of the requirements .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (a).) There are six requirements. (Id., subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(F).)\n          First, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant suffers from a mental disorder\nas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder shall be provided by\nthe defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, the court must also be \u201csatisfied that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was\na significant factor in the commission of the charged offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B).) \u201cA court may conclude that a defendant\u2019s mental disorder was a\nsignificant factor in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any\nrelevant and credible evidence, \u2026 the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder substantially contributed to the defendant\u2019s involvement in the commission of\nthe offense.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\f       Third, \u201ca qualified mental health expert\u201d must opine that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to\nmental health treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Fourth, subject to certain exceptions, the defendant must consent to diversion and\nwaive his or her right to a speedy trial. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(D).) Fifth, the defendant\nmust agree \u201cto comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1)(E).)\n       Finally, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant will not pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety \u2026 if treated in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(F).)\n       If a trial court determines that a defendant meets the six requirements, then the\ncourt must also determine whether \u201cthe recommended inpatient or outpatient program of\nmental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the\ndefendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(1)(A).) The court may then grant diversion and refer\nthe defendant to an approved treatment program. (Id., subd. (c)(1)(B).) \u201cThe period\nduring which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no\nlonger than two years.\u201d (Id., subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant commits additional crimes,\nor otherwise performs unsatisfactorily in diversion, then the court may reinstate criminal\nproceedings. (Id., subd. (d).) However, if the defendant performs \u201csatisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings .\u2026\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n       The Legislature amended section 1001.36 a few months after it was enacted \u201cto\nspecify that defendants charged with certain crimes, such as murder and rape, are\nineligible for diversion.\u201d (People v. Frahs (2020) 9 Cal.5th 618, 627; see \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(2).)\nII.    Mental Health Diversion Eligibility Under Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\n       Among other mandatory prerequisites, diversion may be granted if a defendant\nestablishes under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that he or she \u201csuffers from a mental disorder\n\n                                             9.\n\fas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).)\n       The central question presented is whether a diagnosis for ASPD\u2014an excluded\ndisorder\u2014renders petitioner statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) even though the court concluded petitioner has three other\nqualifying mental health disorders.\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A trial court\u2019s factual findings under section 1001.36 must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and the court\u2019s diversion eligibility determinations are reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion. (People v. Oneal (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 581, 588\u2013589 [reviewing\nunder abuse of discretion standard whether the defendant\u2019s disorder played a significant\nrole in the commission of charged offense]; People v. Moine (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 440,\n448\u2013449 [whether the defendant posed unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if\ntreated in the community reviewed for abuse of discretion].)\n       The question posed here, however, is one that turns on an issue of statutory\ninterpretation and the application of that statute to undisputed facts: whether a person\ndiagnosed with both qualifying and excluded mental health disorders is statutorily\nineligible for diversion under the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Our review of\nthis issue is de novo. (People v. Prunty (2015) 62 Cal.4th 59, 71 [statutory\ninterpretation]; People v. Chubbuck (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1, 7 [application of statute to\nundisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review].)\n       B.     Petitioner is Not Statutorily Ineligible for Diversion\n       Petitioner and the Attorney General maintain section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not\nestablish a bar to diversion based on the presence of an excluded disorder, such as ASPD.\nThey argue section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) merely limits the types of disorders a defendant\n\n                                            10.\n\fmay use to carry his or her burden of establishing a qualifying disorder. In other words, a\ndefendant satisfies section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) so long as he or she suffers from a\nqualifying disorder, even if he or she is also diagnosed with an excluded disorder.\nAccording to petitioner and the Attorney General, the trial court improperly treated\npetitioner\u2019s ASPD diagnosis as a bar to diversion rather than simply recognizing that this\ndiagnosis could not be used to satisfy the requirement of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n       The trial court obviously interpreted section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) differently and\nconcluded that petitioner is statutorily ineligible for diversion, regardless of his other\nqualifying mental disorders, because he suffers from ASPD\u2014an excluded disorder. The\ntrial court is not alone in interpreting the statute to entirely preclude diversion for those\ndefendants who suffer from an excluded disorder listed in section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). As\none treatise has noted, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the statute suggests the Legislature\nintended to exclude persons with [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and\npedophilia, whether the person also suffers from other, qualified disorders.\u201d (Couzens et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2021) \u00a7 7:22).)\n       Despite these differing interpretations of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the language\nstrikes us as unambiguous. Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires the defendant to establish\nhe or she suffers from \u201ca mental disorder\u201d identified in the most recent edition of the\nDSM and then provides a nonexhaustive list of included disorders that suffice, followed\nby a list of excluded disorders that do not. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A), italics added.) Listing\nincluded and excluded disorders in this format simply articulates which disorders may\nand may not serve to prove the defendant has at least one qualifying mental disorder.\n       It is entirely predictable, and thus certainly within the contemplation of the\nLegislature, that a person might suffer from included and excluded disorders. Because\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires suffering only one included disorder, the Legislature\nwould have been aware a defendant could still meet that requirement notwithstanding\nsuffering from a disorder section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) designates as excluded. Had the\n\n                                              11.\n\fLegislature intended to wholly preclude from diversion any person diagnosed with an\nexcluded disorder (regardless of concurrently suffering from included disorders), the\nsentence phrasing of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) would have shifted from simply listing\nexcluded disorders to disqualifying persons with any of the excluded disorders.\n       But even assuming the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) was ambiguous in\nthis regard, the result is no different. One of the stated purposes of title 6, part 2,\nchapter 2.8A of the Penal Code, of which section 1001.36 is a part, is to increase\ndiversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals\u2019 entry and\nreentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. (\u00a7 1001.35,\nsubd. (a).) This purpose militates an interpretation of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that\nfosters more inclusivity in diversion eligibility, not less. Wholly eliminating diversion\neligibility for defendants who suffer from qualifying disorders because they also suffer\nfrom an excluded disorder does not further this purpose.4 Rather, it potentially excludes\na wide swath of defendants who otherwise suffer from qualifying disorders that could be\namenable to treatment, and whose entry and reentry into the criminal justice system\nmight be mitigated. (See People v. Cornett (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265 [if statute is\nambiguous, courts may consider other aids such as the statute\u2019s purpose].)\nSection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) simply disallows defendants from establishing eligibility for\ndiversion based on an excluded disorder. Suffering from an excluded disorder does not\ncategorically bar defendants from establishing eligibility based on a different, qualifying\ndisorder.\n       We conclude that because petitioner suffered from eligible, qualifying mental\ndisorders that the court accepted as proven, petitioner\u2019s additional diagnosis for ASPD,\n\n4       At the hearing, Dr. Musacco estimated \u201cat least a majority\u201d of incarcerated persons suffer\nfrom ASPD. It is not clear whether that estimate is based on the diagnostic criteria of ASPD laid\nout in the most recent edition of the DSM, but it underscores how eliminating all eligibility for\nthose suffering from ASPD and other included mental conditions would likely have an expansive\nexcluding effect.\n\n\n                                               12.\n\fan excluded disorder, did not render him statutorily ineligible under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Denial of diversion eligibility merely because of the existence\nof an excluded disorder was incorrect.\nIII.   A New Diversion Eligibility Hearing is Required\n       As the trial court rested its denial of diversion on ineligibility under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the court did not consider the remaining diversion eligibility\nprerequisites. For example, the court did not consider whether the qualified disorders\nwere significant factors in the commission of the offenses and whether the qualified\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior were treatable. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(B) & (C).)\nThese determinations may be more difficult with diagnoses for included and excluded\ndisorders. Dr. Musacco explained he had considered petitioner\u2019s qualifying mental\ndisorders in isolation from his ASPD, but he acknowledged he could not neatly separate\npetitioner\u2019s behavior by disorder\u2014one disorder might exacerbate others and together\ncause a behavioral function decline. In the context of Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion, the trial\ncourt alluded to the complexity of assessing which disorder contributed to petitioner\u2019s\ncriminal conduct and whether that disorder would respond to treatment. A new eligibility\nhearing is required for the court to consider these and all other remaining eligibility\nprerequisites under section 1001.36(b)(1).\n       We express no opinion how the trial court should evaluate the remaining eligibility\nrequirements, including the interrelationship among included and excluded disorders for\nthe purposes of section 1001.36, subdivision (b)(1)(B) and (C), or whether petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for diversion should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of mandate is granted as follows: the trial court\u2019s\norder denying diversion is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a new hearing in\naccordance with this opinion on petitioner\u2019s motion for mental health diversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              MEEHAN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nSMITH, Acting P.

We conclude\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not wholly preclude from diversion defendants who suffer\nfrom both excluded and included mental health disorders; section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\nrequires only that a defendant suffers from one qualified mental health disorder. The trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of diversion was incorrect under our interpretation of the\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the trial court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for\na new eligibility hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for diversion under section 1001.36.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n       Petitioner has two pending criminal cases. Petitioner filed a motion for mental\nhealth diversion in both cases, a hearing was held on June 22, 2021, and the trial court\ndenied the motions on the ground petitioner was statutorily ineligible for diversion\nbecause his ASPD diagnosis is an excluded disorder under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless indicated otherwise.\n2       We use the term \u201cqualifying\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d interchangeably to describe disorders that\nare identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM) and are not expressly excluded by section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                                2.\n\f(See \u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in both cases to\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion.\nI.     Kern Superior Court Case No. BF180104A\n       On February 18, 2020, police officers witnessed a driver, later identified as\npetitioner, crashing into another car. A traffic stop was attempted, but petitioner refused\nto stop and led police on a chase that lasted several miles. Police ultimately subdued and\narrested him. The driver whose car petitioner crashed into said she had been rammed by\npetitioner\u2019s blue pickup truck three times, tried to move out of the way of the truck, but\npetitioner blocked her from doing so, and then petitioner\u2019s blue truck hit her car\u2019s\npassenger side.3\n       Following a preliminary examination, an information was filed on March 6, 2020,\nwhich alleged two felony counts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon (a car) under\nsection 245, subdivision (a)(1) and (2) felony evasion of a peace officer in violation of\nVehicle Code section 2800.2. As to each count, two prior felony convictions were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)) and\nalleged to be serious prior felonies under section 667, subdivision (a).\nII.    Kern Superior Court Case No. BF182498A\n       While the first case was pending, a driver later identified as petitioner was seen by\npolice running a red light in a maroon pickup truck on September 17, 2020. When the\nofficer attempted a traffic stop, petitioner waived his hand out the window and yelled,\n\u201c\u2018no brakes.\u2019\u201d A chase ensued, petitioner fled the vehicle and hid, but officers found him\nand arrested him after he initially resisted.\n       After a preliminary hearing was held, an information was filed on October 29,\n2020, alleging (1) felony evading a police officer under Vehicle Code section 2800.2;\n\n\n3       The background facts in both matters are taken from the preliminary examination hearing\ntranscripts. These facts have not been proven or admitted.\n\n\n                                                3.\n\f(2) resisting or obstructing a police officer in violation of section 148, subdivision (a)(1);\nand (3) driving without a license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500,\nsubdivision (a), a misdemeanor. An enhancement was alleged as to count 1 for\ncommitting an offense while on bail under section 12022.1, and prior felony strikes were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law.\nIII.   Mental Health Diversion Requested and Denied in Both Cases\n       A.     Medical Evaluation\n       On March 25, 2021, petitioner underwent a psychological evaluation with\nDr. Musacco. Dr. Musacco was provided Bakersfield Police Department records,\npetitioner\u2019s prior evaluations for competency to stand trial, mental health records from\nCalifornia Correctional Health Care Services, and petitioner\u2019s criminal rap sheet.\n       Following the evaluation, Dr. Musacco diagnosed petitioner with (1) stimulant use\ndisorder, in remission in a controlled environment; (2) unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum disorder; (3) borderline intellectual functioning; and (4) ASPD. The ASPD\ndiagnosis was based upon petitioner\u2019s criminal behaviors that Dr. Musacco characterized\nas occurring throughout petitioner\u2019s adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Musacco opined\npetitioner\u2019s psychosis, drug use disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning\ncontributed to his criminal behaviors, but that petitioner\u2019s ASPD was an \u201cimportant\ncondition contributing to his actions.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[s]ome of the [petitioner\u2019s]\nmental conditions would be responsive to treatment. For example, if the [petitioner]\nsuccessfully participated in a drug treatment program, I believe his functioning would\nsubstantially improve. The [petitioner\u2019s] symptoms of psychosis would also be amenable\nto antipsychotic medications. The [petitioner\u2019s] Borderline Intellectual Functioning\nwould not be amenable to psychiatric treatment per se.\u201d\n       B.     Hearing on Petitioner\u2019s Motions for Mental Health Diversion\n       Supported by Dr. Musacco\u2019s evaluation, petitioner filed a motion seeking mental\nhealth diversion under section 1001.36 in both of his pending criminal cases, and a\n\n                                              4.\n\fhearing on the motions was held on June 22, 2021. The defense called Dr. Musacco as an\nexpert witness, and he gave testimony consistent with his written evaluation. As far as\nhow petitioner\u2019s diagnosed conditions contributed to his criminal conduct, Dr. Musacco\nexplained there was \u201ckind of an accumulative effect amongst these diagnoses,\u201d and that\npetitioner\u2019s three qualifying disorders operated together to significantly contribute to his\ncriminal conduct.\n       Dr. Musacco also explained, however, that it \u201cwould be impossible to subtract out\nthe influence of an [ASPD] here, and that\u2019s why I referenced it early on as an important\ncondition, which I believe has pervasive impact on his functioning. Also saying that it is\nalso a condition that does not qualify for Diversion. So[,] I don\u2019t think that there is\u2014you\nknow, each [of] these conditions have\u2014they are interrelated, and I don\u2019t [think] there is a\nway to entirely pull one string apart from the other and get a\u2014be able to say, you know,\nfor example, his drug use disorder didn\u2019t play a role in this\u2014in his behavior. I don\u2019t\nthink I could do that, and I don\u2019t think I could do that on an [ASPD] as well. They are all\ntangled up.\u201d\n       The court questioned Dr. Musacco during the hearing as well:\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I understand this. The 4\n       diagnos[e]s you offer, you can\u2019t separate any one of those out?\n\n             \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Well, I can separate A[S]PD \u2026 for this\n       purpose because it\u2019s excluded. We\u2019ve got to say I can\u2019t consider that.\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: But if\u2014here is what I\u2019m getting at .\u2026 If they\n       exclude someone with [ASPD] if that\u2019s all he had, he would be excluded?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Absolutely.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: But he has these 3 other diagnos[e]s. How does the\n       fact he has one of them, the [ASPD], does that mean he\u2019s not eligible\n       because he has it and the doctor can\u2019t exclude that as a factor in his\n       behavior, or can the Court rule well, he\u2019s got these other diagnos[e]s. Can I\n       ignore the A[S]PD .\u2026? Can I exclude that? I don\u2019t think\u2014Doctor, what I\n       hear you say is these are all intermixed?\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I believe so, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: So[,] let me ask you this. Does his [ASPD] [a]ffect\n       his decisions in using illegal drugs, s[t]imulants such as methamphetamine?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I would say, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: And then. Okay. Is there \u2026 is one of these\u2014any\n       one of these 4 predominant do you think or just all intermixed?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I think it is day-by-day, hour-by-hour. But the\n       Borderline Intellectual Functioning and [ASPD] are both, they are kind of\n       steady ongoing issues. They don\u2019t spike or plateau the way the substance\n       use disorder would or the [p]sychosis would. So\u2014so his personality\n       disorder is an ingrained chronic condition that we wouldn\u2019t expect again\n       based on the eval[uation]. Same with Borderline Intellectual Functioning,\n       he\u2019s not going to get smarter or less smart[] day 1 to day 2. But if he\u2019s\n       using drugs \u2026 or hearing v[o]ices, we can anticipate that his function will\n       decline due to those added stressor[s]. So again, it is kind of a\u2014it is like a\n       ball [of] string and you pull one out, but you can\u2019t entirely separate it from\n       the ball as you have it.\u201d\n       When asked on redirect to characterize ASPD, Dr. Musacco explained the\ndiagnosis for ASPD is characterized as \u201ca pattern of criminal behavior, ignoring rules, or\nbeing willing to violate rules, neglecting obligations. You know, when we think about a\ntypical person who is a revolving door of prison in jail, a vast\u2014well, at least a majority\nof those persons have [ASPD]. Meaning, they have characteristically violated rules and\n[norms] and expectations to their detriment and the detriment of those around them.\u201d\n       C.      Denial of Diversion and Petitioner\u2019s Writ Petitions\n       The court denied the motions for diversion, noting Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion that\npetitioner\u2019s qualifying disorders were all interrelated with his ASPD. The court ruled\npetitioner is statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under section 1001.36\nbecause he suffers from ASPD, an excluded condition. The court explained that although\npetitioner has three other eligible conditions, the fourth diagnosis for ASPD operated as a\nbar to eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate in both underlying cases to vacate\nthe court\u2019s order and grant his motions for admission into a mental health diversion\nprogram under section 1001.36.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that he suffers from qualifying mental health\ndisorders under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), which the court acknowledged. According to\npetitioner, the fact that he also suffers from ASPD does not make him per se ineligible for\ndiversion under section 1001.36, and the court erred in concluding otherwise. Moreover,\npetitioner maintains, he has satisfied all of the requirements for diversion under\nsection 1001.36 and his motions for diversion should be granted.\n       The Attorney General filed responses to the petitions on behalf of the People, the\nreal party in interest. The Attorney General agrees that the trial court erred in denying\ndiversion on the ground petitioner suffers from ASPD\u2014the fact petitioner has been\ndiagnosed with an excluded mental disorder does not bar him completely from diversion\nwhen he also suffers from other qualified mental health disorders. Moreover, according\nto the Attorney General, the court\u2019s order did not address whether petitioner\u2019s qualifying\nmental disorders were a significant factor in the charged offenses and whether the mental\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior would respond to treatment. (See \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B) & (C).) The Attorney General urges this court to grant the petition for a\nwrit of mandate, vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion, and remand for another\nhearing to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for diversion.\nI.     Mental Health Diversion Under Section 1001.36\n       Effective June 27, 2018, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for\ndefendants with diagnosed and qualifying mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (a).) One of the stated\npurposes of the legislation was to promote \u201c[i]ncreased diversion of individuals with\nmental disorders \u2026 while protecting public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.35, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              7.\n\f          \u201c\u2018[P]retrial diversion\u2019 means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily\nor permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is\ncharged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health\ntreatment .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the defendant has performed satisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial\ndiversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n          \u201cOn an accusatory pleading alleging the commission of a misdemeanor or felony\noffense, the court may, after considering the positions of the defense and prosecution,\ngrant pretrial diversion \u2026 if the defendant meets all of the requirements .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (a).) There are six requirements. (Id., subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(F).)\n          First, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant suffers from a mental disorder\nas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder shall be provided by\nthe defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, the court must also be \u201csatisfied that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was\na significant factor in the commission of the charged offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B).) \u201cA court may conclude that a defendant\u2019s mental disorder was a\nsignificant factor in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any\nrelevant and credible evidence, \u2026 the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder substantially contributed to the defendant\u2019s involvement in the commission of\nthe offense.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\f       Third, \u201ca qualified mental health expert\u201d must opine that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to\nmental health treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Fourth, subject to certain exceptions, the defendant must consent to diversion and\nwaive his or her right to a speedy trial. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(D).) Fifth, the defendant\nmust agree \u201cto comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1)(E).)\n       Finally, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant will not pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety \u2026 if treated in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(F).)\n       If a trial court determines that a defendant meets the six requirements, then the\ncourt must also determine whether \u201cthe recommended inpatient or outpatient program of\nmental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the\ndefendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(1)(A).) The court may then grant diversion and refer\nthe defendant to an approved treatment program. (Id., subd. (c)(1)(B).) \u201cThe period\nduring which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no\nlonger than two years.\u201d (Id., subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant commits additional crimes,\nor otherwise performs unsatisfactorily in diversion, then the court may reinstate criminal\nproceedings. (Id., subd. (d).) However, if the defendant performs \u201csatisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings .\u2026\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n       The Legislature amended section 1001.36 a few months after it was enacted \u201cto\nspecify that defendants charged with certain crimes, such as murder and rape, are\nineligible for diversion.\u201d (People v. Frahs (2020) 9 Cal.5th 618, 627; see \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(2).)\nII.    Mental Health Diversion Eligibility Under Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\n       Among other mandatory prerequisites, diversion may be granted if a defendant\nestablishes under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that he or she \u201csuffers from a mental disorder\n\n                                             9.\n\fas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).)\n       The central question presented is whether a diagnosis for ASPD\u2014an excluded\ndisorder\u2014renders petitioner statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) even though the court concluded petitioner has three other\nqualifying mental health disorders.\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A trial court\u2019s factual findings under section 1001.36 must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and the court\u2019s diversion eligibility determinations are reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion. (People v. Oneal (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 581, 588\u2013589 [reviewing\nunder abuse of discretion standard whether the defendant\u2019s disorder played a significant\nrole in the commission of charged offense]; People v. Moine (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 440,\n448\u2013449 [whether the defendant posed unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if\ntreated in the community reviewed for abuse of discretion].)\n       The question posed here, however, is one that turns on an issue of statutory\ninterpretation and the application of that statute to undisputed facts: whether a person\ndiagnosed with both qualifying and excluded mental health disorders is statutorily\nineligible for diversion under the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Our review of\nthis issue is de novo. (People v. Prunty (2015) 62 Cal.4th 59, 71 [statutory\ninterpretation]; People v. Chubbuck (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1, 7 [application of statute to\nundisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review].)\n       B.     Petitioner is Not Statutorily Ineligible for Diversion\n       Petitioner and the Attorney General maintain section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not\nestablish a bar to diversion based on the presence of an excluded disorder, such as ASPD.\nThey argue section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) merely limits the types of disorders a defendant\n\n                                            10.\n\fmay use to carry his or her burden of establishing a qualifying disorder. In other words, a\ndefendant satisfies section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) so long as he or she suffers from a\nqualifying disorder, even if he or she is also diagnosed with an excluded disorder.\nAccording to petitioner and the Attorney General, the trial court improperly treated\npetitioner\u2019s ASPD diagnosis as a bar to diversion rather than simply recognizing that this\ndiagnosis could not be used to satisfy the requirement of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n       The trial court obviously interpreted section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) differently and\nconcluded that petitioner is statutorily ineligible for diversion, regardless of his other\nqualifying mental disorders, because he suffers from ASPD\u2014an excluded disorder. The\ntrial court is not alone in interpreting the statute to entirely preclude diversion for those\ndefendants who suffer from an excluded disorder listed in section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). As\none treatise has noted, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the statute suggests the Legislature\nintended to exclude persons with [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and\npedophilia, whether the person also suffers from other, qualified disorders.\u201d (Couzens et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2021) \u00a7 7:22).)\n       Despite these differing interpretations of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the language\nstrikes us as unambiguous. Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires the defendant to establish\nhe or she suffers from \u201ca mental disorder\u201d identified in the most recent edition of the\nDSM and then provides a nonexhaustive list of included disorders that suffice, followed\nby a list of excluded disorders that do not. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A), italics added.) Listing\nincluded and excluded disorders in this format simply articulates which disorders may\nand may not serve to prove the defendant has at least one qualifying mental disorder.\n       It is entirely predictable, and thus certainly within the contemplation of the\nLegislature, that a person might suffer from included and excluded disorders. Because\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires suffering only one included disorder, the Legislature\nwould have been aware a defendant could still meet that requirement notwithstanding\nsuffering from a disorder section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) designates as excluded. Had the\n\n                                              11.\n\fLegislature intended to wholly preclude from diversion any person diagnosed with an\nexcluded disorder (regardless of concurrently suffering from included disorders), the\nsentence phrasing of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) would have shifted from simply listing\nexcluded disorders to disqualifying persons with any of the excluded disorders.\n       But even assuming the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) was ambiguous in\nthis regard, the result is no different. One of the stated purposes of title 6, part 2,\nchapter 2.8A of the Penal Code, of which section 1001.36 is a part, is to increase\ndiversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals\u2019 entry and\nreentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. (\u00a7 1001.35,\nsubd. (a).) This purpose militates an interpretation of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that\nfosters more inclusivity in diversion eligibility, not less. Wholly eliminating diversion\neligibility for defendants who suffer from qualifying disorders because they also suffer\nfrom an excluded disorder does not further this purpose.4 Rather, it potentially excludes\na wide swath of defendants who otherwise suffer from qualifying disorders that could be\namenable to treatment, and whose entry and reentry into the criminal justice system\nmight be mitigated. (See People v. Cornett (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265 [if statute is\nambiguous, courts may consider other aids such as the statute\u2019s purpose].)\nSection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) simply disallows defendants from establishing eligibility for\ndiversion based on an excluded disorder. Suffering from an excluded disorder does not\ncategorically bar defendants from establishing eligibility based on a different, qualifying\ndisorder.\n       We conclude that because petitioner suffered from eligible, qualifying mental\ndisorders that the court accepted as proven, petitioner\u2019s additional diagnosis for ASPD,\n\n4       At the hearing, Dr. Musacco estimated \u201cat least a majority\u201d of incarcerated persons suffer\nfrom ASPD. It is not clear whether that estimate is based on the diagnostic criteria of ASPD laid\nout in the most recent edition of the DSM, but it underscores how eliminating all eligibility for\nthose suffering from ASPD and other included mental conditions would likely have an expansive\nexcluding effect.\n\n\n                                               12.\n\fan excluded disorder, did not render him statutorily ineligible under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Denial of diversion eligibility merely because of the existence\nof an excluded disorder was incorrect.\nIII.   A New Diversion Eligibility Hearing is Required\n       As the trial court rested its denial of diversion on ineligibility under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the court did not consider the remaining diversion eligibility\nprerequisites. For example, the court did not consider whether the qualified disorders\nwere significant factors in the commission of the offenses and whether the qualified\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior were treatable. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(B) & (C).)\nThese determinations may be more difficult with diagnoses for included and excluded\ndisorders. Dr. Musacco explained he had considered petitioner\u2019s qualifying mental\ndisorders in isolation from his ASPD, but he acknowledged he could not neatly separate\npetitioner\u2019s behavior by disorder\u2014one disorder might exacerbate others and together\ncause a behavioral function decline. In the context of Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion, the trial\ncourt alluded to the complexity of assessing which disorder contributed to petitioner\u2019s\ncriminal conduct and whether that disorder would respond to treatment. A new eligibility\nhearing is required for the court to consider these and all other remaining eligibility\nprerequisites under section 1001.36(b)(1).\n       We express no opinion how the trial court should evaluate the remaining eligibility\nrequirements, including the interrelationship among included and excluded disorders for\nthe purposes of section 1001.36, subdivision (b)(1)(B) and (C), or whether petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for diversion should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of mandate is granted as follows: the trial court\u2019s\norder denying diversion is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a new hearing in\naccordance with this opinion on petitioner\u2019s motion for mental health diversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              MEEHAN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nSMITH, Acting P.

We conclude\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not wholly preclude from diversion defendants who suffer\nfrom both excluded and included mental health disorders; section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\nrequires only that a defendant suffers from one qualified mental health disorder. The trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of diversion was incorrect under our interpretation of the\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the trial court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for\na new eligibility hearing on petitioner\u2019s request for diversion under section 1001.36.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n       Petitioner has two pending criminal cases. Petitioner filed a motion for mental\nhealth diversion in both cases, a hearing was held on June 22, 2021, and the trial court\ndenied the motions on the ground petitioner was statutorily ineligible for diversion\nbecause his ASPD diagnosis is an excluded disorder under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless indicated otherwise.\n2       We use the term \u201cqualifying\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d interchangeably to describe disorders that\nare identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM) and are not expressly excluded by section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                                2.\n\f(See \u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in both cases to\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion.\nI.     Kern Superior Court Case No. BF180104A\n       On February 18, 2020, police officers witnessed a driver, later identified as\npetitioner, crashing into another car. A traffic stop was attempted, but petitioner refused\nto stop and led police on a chase that lasted several miles. Police ultimately subdued and\narrested him. The driver whose car petitioner crashed into said she had been rammed by\npetitioner\u2019s blue pickup truck three times, tried to move out of the way of the truck, but\npetitioner blocked her from doing so, and then petitioner\u2019s blue truck hit her car\u2019s\npassenger side.3\n       Following a preliminary examination, an information was filed on March 6, 2020,\nwhich alleged two felony counts: (1) assault with a deadly weapon (a car) under\nsection 245, subdivision (a)(1) and (2) felony evasion of a peace officer in violation of\nVehicle Code section 2800.2. As to each count, two prior felony convictions were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)) and\nalleged to be serious prior felonies under section 667, subdivision (a).\nII.    Kern Superior Court Case No. BF182498A\n       While the first case was pending, a driver later identified as petitioner was seen by\npolice running a red light in a maroon pickup truck on September 17, 2020. When the\nofficer attempted a traffic stop, petitioner waived his hand out the window and yelled,\n\u201c\u2018no brakes.\u2019\u201d A chase ensued, petitioner fled the vehicle and hid, but officers found him\nand arrested him after he initially resisted.\n       After a preliminary hearing was held, an information was filed on October 29,\n2020, alleging (1) felony evading a police officer under Vehicle Code section 2800.2;\n\n\n3       The background facts in both matters are taken from the preliminary examination hearing\ntranscripts. These facts have not been proven or admitted.\n\n\n                                                3.\n\f(2) resisting or obstructing a police officer in violation of section 148, subdivision (a)(1);\nand (3) driving without a license in violation of Vehicle Code section 12500,\nsubdivision (a), a misdemeanor. An enhancement was alleged as to count 1 for\ncommitting an offense while on bail under section 12022.1, and prior felony strikes were\nalleged under the Three Strikes law.\nIII.   Mental Health Diversion Requested and Denied in Both Cases\n       A.     Medical Evaluation\n       On March 25, 2021, petitioner underwent a psychological evaluation with\nDr. Musacco. Dr. Musacco was provided Bakersfield Police Department records,\npetitioner\u2019s prior evaluations for competency to stand trial, mental health records from\nCalifornia Correctional Health Care Services, and petitioner\u2019s criminal rap sheet.\n       Following the evaluation, Dr. Musacco diagnosed petitioner with (1) stimulant use\ndisorder, in remission in a controlled environment; (2) unspecified schizophrenia\nspectrum disorder; (3) borderline intellectual functioning; and (4) ASPD. The ASPD\ndiagnosis was based upon petitioner\u2019s criminal behaviors that Dr. Musacco characterized\nas occurring throughout petitioner\u2019s adolescence and adulthood. Dr. Musacco opined\npetitioner\u2019s psychosis, drug use disorder, and borderline intellectual functioning\ncontributed to his criminal behaviors, but that petitioner\u2019s ASPD was an \u201cimportant\ncondition contributing to his actions.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[s]ome of the [petitioner\u2019s]\nmental conditions would be responsive to treatment. For example, if the [petitioner]\nsuccessfully participated in a drug treatment program, I believe his functioning would\nsubstantially improve. The [petitioner\u2019s] symptoms of psychosis would also be amenable\nto antipsychotic medications. The [petitioner\u2019s] Borderline Intellectual Functioning\nwould not be amenable to psychiatric treatment per se.\u201d\n       B.     Hearing on Petitioner\u2019s Motions for Mental Health Diversion\n       Supported by Dr. Musacco\u2019s evaluation, petitioner filed a motion seeking mental\nhealth diversion under section 1001.36 in both of his pending criminal cases, and a\n\n                                              4.\n\fhearing on the motions was held on June 22, 2021. The defense called Dr. Musacco as an\nexpert witness, and he gave testimony consistent with his written evaluation. As far as\nhow petitioner\u2019s diagnosed conditions contributed to his criminal conduct, Dr. Musacco\nexplained there was \u201ckind of an accumulative effect amongst these diagnoses,\u201d and that\npetitioner\u2019s three qualifying disorders operated together to significantly contribute to his\ncriminal conduct.\n       Dr. Musacco also explained, however, that it \u201cwould be impossible to subtract out\nthe influence of an [ASPD] here, and that\u2019s why I referenced it early on as an important\ncondition, which I believe has pervasive impact on his functioning. Also saying that it is\nalso a condition that does not qualify for Diversion. So[,] I don\u2019t think that there is\u2014you\nknow, each [of] these conditions have\u2014they are interrelated, and I don\u2019t [think] there is a\nway to entirely pull one string apart from the other and get a\u2014be able to say, you know,\nfor example, his drug use disorder didn\u2019t play a role in this\u2014in his behavior. I don\u2019t\nthink I could do that, and I don\u2019t think I could do that on an [ASPD] as well. They are all\ntangled up.\u201d\n       The court questioned Dr. Musacco during the hearing as well:\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I want to make sure I understand this. The 4\n       diagnos[e]s you offer, you can\u2019t separate any one of those out?\n\n             \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Well, I can separate A[S]PD \u2026 for this\n       purpose because it\u2019s excluded. We\u2019ve got to say I can\u2019t consider that.\n\n             \u201cTHE COURT: But if\u2014here is what I\u2019m getting at .\u2026 If they\n       exclude someone with [ASPD] if that\u2019s all he had, he would be excluded?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: Absolutely.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: But he has these 3 other diagnos[e]s. How does the\n       fact he has one of them, the [ASPD], does that mean he\u2019s not eligible\n       because he has it and the doctor can\u2019t exclude that as a factor in his\n       behavior, or can the Court rule well, he\u2019s got these other diagnos[e]s. Can I\n       ignore the A[S]PD .\u2026? Can I exclude that? I don\u2019t think\u2014Doctor, what I\n       hear you say is these are all intermixed?\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I believe so, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: So[,] let me ask you this. Does his [ASPD] [a]ffect\n       his decisions in using illegal drugs, s[t]imulants such as methamphetamine?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I would say, yes.\n\n              \u201cTHE COURT: And then. Okay. Is there \u2026 is one of these\u2014any\n       one of these 4 predominant do you think or just all intermixed?\n\n               \u201c[DR. MUSACCO]: I think it is day-by-day, hour-by-hour. But the\n       Borderline Intellectual Functioning and [ASPD] are both, they are kind of\n       steady ongoing issues. They don\u2019t spike or plateau the way the substance\n       use disorder would or the [p]sychosis would. So\u2014so his personality\n       disorder is an ingrained chronic condition that we wouldn\u2019t expect again\n       based on the eval[uation]. Same with Borderline Intellectual Functioning,\n       he\u2019s not going to get smarter or less smart[] day 1 to day 2. But if he\u2019s\n       using drugs \u2026 or hearing v[o]ices, we can anticipate that his function will\n       decline due to those added stressor[s]. So again, it is kind of a\u2014it is like a\n       ball [of] string and you pull one out, but you can\u2019t entirely separate it from\n       the ball as you have it.\u201d\n       When asked on redirect to characterize ASPD, Dr. Musacco explained the\ndiagnosis for ASPD is characterized as \u201ca pattern of criminal behavior, ignoring rules, or\nbeing willing to violate rules, neglecting obligations. You know, when we think about a\ntypical person who is a revolving door of prison in jail, a vast\u2014well, at least a majority\nof those persons have [ASPD]. Meaning, they have characteristically violated rules and\n[norms] and expectations to their detriment and the detriment of those around them.\u201d\n       C.      Denial of Diversion and Petitioner\u2019s Writ Petitions\n       The court denied the motions for diversion, noting Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion that\npetitioner\u2019s qualifying disorders were all interrelated with his ASPD. The court ruled\npetitioner is statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under section 1001.36\nbecause he suffers from ASPD, an excluded condition. The court explained that although\npetitioner has three other eligible conditions, the fourth diagnosis for ASPD operated as a\nbar to eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandate in both underlying cases to vacate\nthe court\u2019s order and grant his motions for admission into a mental health diversion\nprogram under section 1001.36.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Petitioner\u2019s central argument is that he suffers from qualifying mental health\ndisorders under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), which the court acknowledged. According to\npetitioner, the fact that he also suffers from ASPD does not make him per se ineligible for\ndiversion under section 1001.36, and the court erred in concluding otherwise. Moreover,\npetitioner maintains, he has satisfied all of the requirements for diversion under\nsection 1001.36 and his motions for diversion should be granted.\n       The Attorney General filed responses to the petitions on behalf of the People, the\nreal party in interest. The Attorney General agrees that the trial court erred in denying\ndiversion on the ground petitioner suffers from ASPD\u2014the fact petitioner has been\ndiagnosed with an excluded mental disorder does not bar him completely from diversion\nwhen he also suffers from other qualified mental health disorders. Moreover, according\nto the Attorney General, the court\u2019s order did not address whether petitioner\u2019s qualifying\nmental disorders were a significant factor in the charged offenses and whether the mental\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior would respond to treatment. (See \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B) & (C).) The Attorney General urges this court to grant the petition for a\nwrit of mandate, vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of diversion, and remand for another\nhearing to determine petitioner\u2019s eligibility for diversion.\nI.     Mental Health Diversion Under Section 1001.36\n       Effective June 27, 2018, the Legislature enacted a diversion program for\ndefendants with diagnosed and qualifying mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (a).) One of the stated\npurposes of the legislation was to promote \u201c[i]ncreased diversion of individuals with\nmental disorders \u2026 while protecting public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.35, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              7.\n\f          \u201c\u2018[P]retrial diversion\u2019 means the postponement of prosecution, either temporarily\nor permanently, at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is\ncharged until adjudication, to allow the defendant to undergo mental health\ntreatment .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c).) \u201cIf the defendant has performed satisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings at the time of the initial\ndiversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n          \u201cOn an accusatory pleading alleging the commission of a misdemeanor or felony\noffense, the court may, after considering the positions of the defense and prosecution,\ngrant pretrial diversion \u2026 if the defendant meets all of the requirements .\u2026\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (a).) There are six requirements. (Id., subd. (b)(1)(A)\u2013(F).)\n          First, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant suffers from a mental disorder\nas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).) \u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder shall be provided by\nthe defense and shall include a recent diagnosis by a qualified mental health expert.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, the court must also be \u201csatisfied that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was\na significant factor in the commission of the charged offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(B).) \u201cA court may conclude that a defendant\u2019s mental disorder was a\nsignificant factor in the commission of the charged offense if, after reviewing any\nrelevant and credible evidence, \u2026 the court concludes that the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder substantially contributed to the defendant\u2019s involvement in the commission of\nthe offense.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                8.\n\f       Third, \u201ca qualified mental health expert\u201d must opine that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\nsymptoms of the mental disorder motivating the criminal behavior would respond to\nmental health treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Fourth, subject to certain exceptions, the defendant must consent to diversion and\nwaive his or her right to a speedy trial. (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (b)(1)(D).) Fifth, the defendant\nmust agree \u201cto comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1)(E).)\n       Finally, the court must be \u201csatisfied that the defendant will not pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety \u2026 if treated in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(1)(F).)\n       If a trial court determines that a defendant meets the six requirements, then the\ncourt must also determine whether \u201cthe recommended inpatient or outpatient program of\nmental health treatment will meet the specialized mental health treatment needs of the\ndefendant.\u201d (\u00a7 1001.36, subd. (c)(1)(A).) The court may then grant diversion and refer\nthe defendant to an approved treatment program. (Id., subd. (c)(1)(B).) \u201cThe period\nduring which criminal proceedings against the defendant may be diverted shall be no\nlonger than two years.\u201d (Id., subd. (c)(3).) If the defendant commits additional crimes,\nor otherwise performs unsatisfactorily in diversion, then the court may reinstate criminal\nproceedings. (Id., subd. (d).) However, if the defendant performs \u201csatisfactorily in\ndiversion, at the end of the period of diversion, the court shall dismiss the defendant\u2019s\ncriminal charges that were the subject of the criminal proceedings .\u2026\u201d (Id., subd. (e).)\n       The Legislature amended section 1001.36 a few months after it was enacted \u201cto\nspecify that defendants charged with certain crimes, such as murder and rape, are\nineligible for diversion.\u201d (People v. Frahs (2020) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">9 Cal.5th 618</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627; see \u00a7 1001.36,\nsubd. (b)(2).)\nII.    Mental Health Diversion Eligibility Under Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A)\n       Among other mandatory prerequisites, diversion may be granted if a defendant\nestablishes under section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that he or she \u201csuffers from a mental disorder\n\n                                             9.\n\fas identified in the most recent edition of the [DSM], including, but not limited to, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, but\nexcluding [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and pedophilia.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A).)\n       The central question presented is whether a diagnosis for ASPD\u2014an excluded\ndisorder\u2014renders petitioner statutorily ineligible for mental health diversion under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) even though the court concluded petitioner has three other\nqualifying mental health disorders.\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       A trial court\u2019s factual findings under section 1001.36 must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence, and the court\u2019s diversion eligibility determinations are reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion. (People v. Oneal (2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">64 Cal.App.5th 581</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588\u2013589 [reviewing\nunder abuse of discretion standard whether the defendant\u2019s disorder played a significant\nrole in the commission of charged offense]; People v.

Our review of\nthis issue is de novo. (People v. Prunty (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">62 Cal.4th 59</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 [statutory\ninterpretation]; People v. Chubbuck (2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">43 Cal.App.5th 1</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 [application of statute to\nundisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review].)\n       B.     Petitioner is Not Statutorily Ineligible for Diversion\n       Petitioner and the Attorney General maintain section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) does not\nestablish a bar to diversion based on the presence of an excluded disorder, such as ASPD.\nThey argue section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) merely limits the types of disorders a defendant\n\n                                            10.\n\fmay use to carry his or her burden of establishing a qualifying disorder. In other words, a\ndefendant satisfies section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) so long as he or she suffers from a\nqualifying disorder, even if he or she is also diagnosed with an excluded disorder.\nAccording to petitioner and the Attorney General, the trial court improperly treated\npetitioner\u2019s ASPD diagnosis as a bar to diversion rather than simply recognizing that this\ndiagnosis could not be used to satisfy the requirement of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A).\n       The trial court obviously interpreted section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) differently and\nconcluded that petitioner is statutorily ineligible for diversion, regardless of his other\nqualifying mental disorders, because he suffers from ASPD\u2014an excluded disorder. The\ntrial court is not alone in interpreting the statute to entirely preclude diversion for those\ndefendants who suffer from an excluded disorder listed in section 1001.36(b)(1)(A). As\none treatise has noted, \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the statute suggests the Legislature\nintended to exclude persons with [ASPD], borderline personality disorder, and\npedophilia, whether the person also suffers from other, qualified disorders.\u201d (Couzens et\nal., Cal. Practice Guide: Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2021) \u00a7 7:22).)\n       Despite these differing interpretations of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the language\nstrikes us as unambiguous. Section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires the defendant to establish\nhe or she suffers from \u201ca mental disorder\u201d identified in the most recent edition of the\nDSM and then provides a nonexhaustive list of included disorders that suffice, followed\nby a list of excluded disorders that do not. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(A), italics added.) Listing\nincluded and excluded disorders in this format simply articulates which disorders may\nand may not serve to prove the defendant has at least one qualifying mental disorder.\n       It is entirely predictable, and thus certainly within the contemplation of the\nLegislature, that a person might suffer from included and excluded disorders. Because\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) requires suffering only one included disorder, the Legislature\nwould have been aware a defendant could still meet that requirement notwithstanding\nsuffering from a disorder section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) designates as excluded. Had the\n\n                                              11.\n\fLegislature intended to wholly preclude from diversion any person diagnosed with an\nexcluded disorder (regardless of concurrently suffering from included disorders), the\nsentence phrasing of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) would have shifted from simply listing\nexcluded disorders to disqualifying persons with any of the excluded disorders.\n       But even assuming the language of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) was ambiguous in\nthis regard, the result is no different. One of the stated purposes of title 6, part 2,\nchapter 2.8A of the Penal Code, of which section 1001.36 is a part, is to increase\ndiversion of individuals with mental disorders to mitigate the individuals\u2019 entry and\nreentry into the criminal justice system while protecting public safety. (\u00a7 1001.35,\nsubd. (a).) This purpose militates an interpretation of section 1001.36(b)(1)(A) that\nfosters more inclusivity in diversion eligibility, not less. Wholly eliminating diversion\neligibility for defendants who suffer from qualifying disorders because they also suffer\nfrom an excluded disorder does not further this purpose.4 Rather, it potentially excludes\na wide swath of defendants who otherwise suffer from qualifying disorders that could be\namenable to treatment, and whose entry and reentry into the criminal justice system\nmight be mitigated. (See People v. Cornett (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">53 Cal.4th 1261</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265 [if statute is\nambiguous, courts may consider other aids such as the statute\u2019s purpose].)\nSection 1001.36(b)(1)(A) simply disallows defendants from establishing eligibility for\ndiversion based on an excluded disorder. Suffering from an excluded disorder does not\ncategorically bar defendants from establishing eligibility based on a different, qualifying\ndisorder.\n       We conclude that because petitioner suffered from eligible, qualifying mental\ndisorders that the court accepted as proven, petitioner\u2019s additional diagnosis for ASPD,\n\n4       At the hearing, Dr. Musacco estimated \u201cat least a majority\u201d of incarcerated persons suffer\nfrom ASPD. It is not clear whether that estimate is based on the diagnostic criteria of ASPD laid\nout in the most recent edition of the DSM, but it underscores how eliminating all eligibility for\nthose suffering from ASPD and other included mental conditions would likely have an expansive\nexcluding effect.\n\n\n                                               12.\n\fan excluded disorder, did not render him statutorily ineligible under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A). Denial of diversion eligibility merely because of the existence\nof an excluded disorder was incorrect.\nIII.   A New Diversion Eligibility Hearing is Required\n       As the trial court rested its denial of diversion on ineligibility under\nsection 1001.36(b)(1)(A), the court did not consider the remaining diversion eligibility\nprerequisites. For example, the court did not consider whether the qualified disorders\nwere significant factors in the commission of the offenses and whether the qualified\ndisorders motivating the criminal behavior were treatable. (\u00a7 1001.36(b)(1)(B) & (C).)\nThese determinations may be more difficult with diagnoses for included and excluded\ndisorders. Dr. Musacco explained he had considered petitioner\u2019s qualifying mental\ndisorders in isolation from his ASPD, but he acknowledged he could not neatly separate\npetitioner\u2019s behavior by disorder\u2014one disorder might exacerbate others and together\ncause a behavioral function decline. In the context of Dr. Musacco\u2019s opinion, the trial\ncourt alluded to the complexity of assessing which disorder contributed to petitioner\u2019s\ncriminal conduct and whether that disorder would respond to treatment. A new eligibility\nhearing is required for the court to consider these and all other remaining eligibility\nprerequisites under section 1001.36(b)(1).\n       We express no opinion how the trial court should evaluate the remaining eligibility\nrequirements, including the interrelationship among included and excluded disorders for\nthe purposes of section 1001.36, subdivision (b)(1)(B) and (C), or whether petitioner\u2019s\nmotion for diversion should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of mandate is granted as follows: the trial court\u2019s\norder denying diversion is vacated, and the matter is remanded for a new hearing in\naccordance with this opinion on petitioner\u2019s motion for mental health diversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              MEEHAN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nSMITH, Acting P.

Owens", "body": "               IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS\n\n\n                                        No. 120,753\n\n                                      STATE OF KANSAS,\n                                          Appellee,\n\n                                              v.\n\n                                       DANE OWENS,\n                                        Appellant.\n\n\n                                SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n1.\n       K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3), the contemporaneous statement exception to the\nhearsay rule, allows a district court judge to admit testimony of a declarant who is\nunavailable as a witness, if the declaration was made at a time when the matter had been\nrecently perceived by the declarant, while the declarant's recollection was clear, and the\ndeclaration was made in good faith prior to the commencement of the action and with no\nincentive to falsify or to distort.\n\n\n2.\n       K.S.A. 60-445 authorizes the district court to exclude relevant evidence if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. But Kansas\nlaw favors the admission of relevant evidence, and the exclusion of relevant evidence\nunder K.S.A. 60-445 is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly.\n\n\n3.\n       Under K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c), a trial court may declare a mistrial if there was\nprejudicial conduct either inside or outside the courtroom that makes it impossible for the\ntrial to proceed without injustice to either the defendant or the prosecution. This statute\n\n\n                                              1\n\fcreates a two-step process. First, the trial court must determine if there was some\nfundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, the trial court moves to the second step and\nassesses whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. In other words, the trial\ncourt must decide if the prejudicial conduct's damaging effect can be removed or\nmitigated by an admonition, jury instruction, or other action. If not, the trial court must\ndetermine whether the degree of prejudice results in an injustice and, if so, declare a\nmistrial. On appeal, the court's abuse of discretion inquiry is divided into two parts,\nasking: (1) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when deciding if there was a\nfundamental failure in the proceeding? and (2) Did the trial court abuse its discretion\nwhen deciding whether the conduct resulted in prejudice that could not be cured or\nmitigated through jury admonition or instruction, resulting in an injustice?\n\n\n4.\n       The State committed prosecutorial error in its closing argument by asserting that\nthe defendant's medical records reflected instances where the defendant missed scheduled\nappointments, but the admitted records did not substantiate this argument. By doing so,\nthe State improperly argued facts not in evidence.\n\n\n5.\n       This court may reverse a defendant's convictions for cumulative error when the\ntotality of the circumstances demonstrate that the defendant was substantially prejudiced\nby cumulative errors and was denied a fair trial.\n\n\n6.\n       Kansas' criminal restitution scheme implicates a defendant's right to trial by jury in\nsection 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights by converting restitution orders, in\nwhich a judge determines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into civil\njudgments, thus bypassing the traditional function of juries to determine civil damages.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fTherefore, a criminal defendant will not be faced with a civil judgment for criminal\nrestitution unless it has been obtained separately through a civil cause of action.\n\n\n        Appeal from Sedgwick County District Court; KEVIN J. O'CONNOR, judge. Opinion filed October\n15, 2021. Affirmed.\n\n\n        Michelle A. Davis, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, argued the cause and was on the brief\nfor appellant.\n\n\n        Lesley A. Isherwood, assistant district attorney, argued the cause, and Marc Bennett, district\nattorney, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with her on the brief for appellee.\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\n\n\n        WALL, J.: A jury convicted Dane Owens of first-degree felony murder and\naggravated burglary in connection with the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Rowena\nIrani. Owens appeals, arguing that multiple evidentiary, trial, and prosecutorial errors\nrequire reversal of his convictions.\n\n\n        However, upon thorough examination of the record and briefing, we determine\nthat only two potential errors occurred during the proceedings. First, the prosecutor\ncommitted error by referring to a fact not in evidence during closing argument. But this\nerror primarily affected Owens' defense to first-degree, premeditated murder, and the jury\nacquitted Owens of this offense. This fact, along with other circumstances, demonstrate\nthe prosecutorial error was harmless.\n\n\n        Second, we presume, without deciding, that the State's failure to disclose the\nfindings of its pseudo-expert witness before trial constituted a fundamental failure in the\nproceedings. However, the presumed error did not inhibit Owens' defense, and the trial\ncourt implemented ameliorative measures to mitigate potential prejudice, which made it\n\n\n                                                     3\n\fpossible to proceed with the trial without injustice. Thus, the record confirms the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Owens' motion for mistrial.\n\n\n       These two errors were not interrelated in a way that amplified their prejudicial\nforce when viewed together. Whether viewed independently or in the aggregate, these\nerrors did not deprive Owens of a fair trial.\n\n\n       As for Owens' sentence, the district court's restitution order does implicate section\n5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights under the current statutory scheme. Several\nstatutory provisions serve to convert a district court's restitution order, in which a judge\ndetermines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into a civil judgment.\nThrough this process, the statutes bypass the traditional function of Kansas juries to\ndetermine civil damages. However, based on our holding in State v. Arnett, 314 Kan. ___,\n(No. 112,572, this day decided), the constitutional infirmity is cured by severing the\noffending statutory provisions. By severing these provisions, Owens will not be subject to\na civil judgment for his criminal restitution order, unless it is obtained separately through\na civil cause of action. Accordingly, the district court's restitution order satisfies\nconstitutional requirements.\n\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm Owens' convictions and restitution order.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On October 3, 2016, Owens entered the home of his ex-girlfriend Rowena and\nfired a single bullet, killing Rowena. Police arrested Owens the same day and charged\nhim with premeditated first-degree murder\u2014or felony murder in the alternative\u2014as well\nas aggravated burglary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fPretrial Evidentiary Issues\n\n\n      Before trial, the State moved to determine the admissibility of hearsay statements\nby Rowena. The State sought to introduce testimony from Rowena's brother, Rooshad\nIrani, about statements Rowena had made to him\u2014both in person and via text message\u2014\nconcerning her relationship and breakup with Owens.\n\n\n      Specifically, the State sought to admit Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him\nthat Owens said he had \"dug a hole\" for an ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him. The\nState argued this evidence was relevant in establishing Rowena's state of mind at the time\nof the shooting. Owens opposed the admission of this \"dug a hole\" testimony on several\ngrounds. The district judge found the statements admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d), the contemporaneous statement hearsay exception, because they went to\nRowena's state of mind and the fact that Owens would not have been welcome in her\nhome. The district judge recommended a limiting instruction.\n\n\n      The State also sought to admit the following text messages between Rowena and\nRooshad:\n\n\n        Sender            Message Content\n        Rooshad           \"You and dane working a few things out?\"\n                          \"His fb popped up as complicated relationship.\"\n\n\n        Rowena            \"lord\"\n                          \"he called yesterday saying he wanted to work it out and to\n                          give him a chance all that i told him to give me some time to\n                          think\"\n                          \"mom texted me saying she had a strong feeling he was going\n                          to physically abuse me if i went back\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fSender     Message Content\nRooshad    \"Ok?

Owens\nargued they were not probative of the mindset the State was attempting to establish\nbecause the emojis suggested Rowena truly did not think Owens would shoot her and,\ninstead, she was just annoyed with him. Further, Owens argued \"under the facts of this\ncase, where [he was] accused of intentionally shooting her in the head, that those are\ncertainly more prejudicial than probative.\" The district judge ruled that the texts were\nadmissible.\n\n\nProsecutor's Opening Statement\n\n\n       The case proceeded to a jury trial. In its opening statement, the State informed the\njury that Detective Robert Chisholm had tried on Owens' sling (which Owens wore\nfollowing shoulder surgery on September 29, 2016) and used a gun to reconstruct or test\n\n\n                                               7\n\fOwens' description of how he wielded the gun inside the sling at the time of the shooting.\nBased on this reconstruction, the State said Detective Chisholm would testify that Owens'\naccount of the shooting was not feasible.\n\n\n       After opening statements, Owens moved for a mistrial, arguing the State\ncommitted discovery violations by failing to disclose Detective Chisholm's reconstruction\nanalysis the prosecution had described in opening remarks. The State argued there was no\ndiscovery violation; the gun and the sling would both come in as evidence, and the\ndetective could do this reenactment in front of the jury. The State further argued the jury\nitself could do the same with the gun and sling once it deliberated in the jury room. The\ndistrict court denied the request for mistrial.\n\n\nTrial Evidence\n\n\n       During the trial, Detective Chisholm testified about his interrogation of Owens the\nday of the shooting. According to Chisolm, Owens said he drove his truck to Rowena's\nneighborhood, parked, and walked to her home. He opted not to park in the Irani family's\ndriveway because he did not want them to call the police. Once there, he saw one of the\nfamily's dogs in the front yard. He let the dog inside and followed it into the home. After\nentering the home, Owens said Rowena \"came around the corner, he was startled, she\nwas startled, and the gun just went off.\" Owens then admitted he pulled the trigger. When\nDetective Chisholm asked why, Owens \"kind of shrug[ged] his shoulders\" and said \"I\nmean\u2014I mean, pretty much accepted the fact that we were done.\" Owens claimed he\n\"wasn't trying to hurt anyone,\" and while admittedly angry, he had typically been able to\ncontrol his emotions. But when asked about the breakup with Rowena, Owens said he\nwas \"'blindsided'\" by it and was tired of being \"'fucked over.'\" He said he took the gun to\nRowena's house \"so she would take him seriously.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       Detective Chisholm said Owens informed law enforcement that he threw his\nhandgun, magazine, and Rowena's cell phone in ponds near his parents' house. Police\nwere able to fish out the gun, a .45 caliber Smith and Wesson. Detective Chisholm\ntestified the gun had a 7-pound trigger pull and a trigger safety preventing the weapon\nfrom firing unless a finger was on the lower part of the trigger. Owens told Detective\nChisholm that he always carried the handgun around, but it was usually in a backpack.\nOwens said he had the gun inside the sling he was wearing on his right arm when he\nentered Rowena's home. He also informed Detective Chisholm that he is right-handed but\nshoots left-handed.\n\n\n       Before trial, Detective Chisholm decided to see if it was feasible to hold the gun\ninside the sling; he tried on the sling and held a gun inside it in the way Owens described.\nDetective Chisholm went through this same reconstruction while on the stand. Through\nthis process, Detective Chisholm determined the gun's slide would have been obstructed\nby the sling. He reasoned that, if the slide was obstructed by the sling, the shell casing\nwould not have ended up where it was ultimately found in the Iranis' home. Further,\nOwens told Detective Chisholm that as he left the Iranis' home, he had a live bullet in the\ngun's chamber. To Detective Chisholm, this suggested the gun's slide likely was not\nobstructed at the time of the shooting. Detective Chisholm also observed no burns,\nabrasions, or other marks on the sling indicating that a gun had been fired inside it.\n\n\n       During Detective Chisholm's testimony, the State also admitted into evidence the\nvideo of Owens' interrogation by police. On this video, Owens provides detectives with\nhis account of the shooting and demonstrates how he wielded the gun in his sling. Owens\nalso admitted during the interview that he sometimes told lies for attention, like when he\nclaimed that he \"dug a hole'\" for a previous ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him. The\ndistrict judge overruled Owens' objections to these \"dug a hole\" comments.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       On cross-examination, Detective Chisholm acknowledged that Owens reported\ndealing with shoulder and back injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\ndepression, and traumatic brain injury. Owens said he had been prescribed medication for\nsome of his mental health issues and was seeking treatment from the Veterans\nAdministration in Wichita and a therapist in Manhattan.\n\n\n       Rooshad testified for the State. He said Rowena told him she broke up with Owens\non September 23, 2016. He testified that Owens texted him on September 27 and 28\nabout Rowena. Then, on Friday September 30, Rooshad texted Owens, \"'You and my\nsister are done. Stop bothering her via text, Facebook, and phone calls or she will file\nharassment charges. It is over. Move on. Thank you.'\"\n\n\n       Rooshad also said that on September 23, 2016, Rowena told him that she spoke\nwith Owens and that Owens said he wanted to get married and start a family soon, which\n\"freaked\" Rowena out. Rooshad testified that according to Rowena, Owens then said that\n\"well, if that freaks you out, then you should know what I have done when I was at war. I\nhave shot and killed men, women, and children.\" Then, Owens \"made a comment of\nhaving a previous girlfriend in his life who had broken up with him a number of years\nprior, and that he had dug a hole for her with a shovel in his truck.\" Rooshad said\nRowena took these statements \"seriously.\"\n\n\n       The State also admitted a recorded phone call with Owens' mother from October 3,\n2016. The State was supposed to have redacted from the call certain law enforcement\nphone numbers, a hold time, and Owens' mother's request for an attorney when asked if\nshe would consent to a search of her home. But the copy that was played for the jury was\nunredacted. In response, Owens renewed his motion for a mistrial. The State opposed the\nmotion, arguing that \"frankly, putting on the fact that a parent doesn't want to have\nofficers search their home, car, or whatever, without a lawyer, without talking to\nsomebody first . . . it certainly does not prejudice the defendant.\" The district judge\n\n\n                                             10\n\ffound the material that was supposed to be redacted was not prejudicial to Owens and\ndenied the motion. The district judge offered to give a limiting instruction, but Owens\ndeclined.\n\n\n       The defense put on several witnesses of their own. Sergeant First Class Steve\nFrye\u2014Owens' former Army squad leader\u2014testified that at 19 years old, Owens saw\nactive combat in Afghanistan and encountered multiple IEDs. On cross, he said Owens\nwas highly trained with firearms and was instructed to always treat them as loaded and\nnever point them at something you do not intend to kill. SFC Frye also testified that\nOwens was a left-handed shooter.\n\n\n       Owens' orthopedic surgeon testified about the September 29, 2016 outpatient\nsurgery performed on Owens' right shoulder. The surgeon testified the surgery did not\naffect the function in Owens' right hand, or his left hand for that matter. The defense also\nadmitted two sets of Owens' medical records: one from the Veterans Administration, and\nthe other from Lafene Health Center in Manhattan.\n\n\n       Finally, Owens' mother testified that Owens' demeanor changed when he returned\nfrom Afghanistan. He would be startled if people touched him and did not like to ride in\nthe front seat of vehicles. While in vehicles, he was constantly observing the road, as if\nlooking for IEDs. Owens was prescribed medication to deal with these issues; the\nmedication helped, but when Owens was off the medication, he was \"jumpy,\" \"agitated,\"\nand \"seemed to be paranoid.\"\n\n\nJury Instructions, Closing Argument, and Verdict\n\n\n       During the jury instruction conference, the district judge proposed the following\naggravated burglary instruction:\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f          \"The defendant is charged with aggravated burglary. The defendant pleads not\nguilty.\n\n\n          \"To establish this charge, each of the following claims must be proved:\n\n\n          1. The defendant entered a dwelling.\n          2. The defendant did so without authority.\n          3. The defendant did so with the intent to commit aggravated assault therein.\n          4. At the time there was a human being in the dwelling.\n          5. This act occurred on or about the 3rd day of October, 2016, in Sedgwick\n          County, Kansas.\n\n\n          \"The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime intentionally. A\ndefendant acts intentionally when it is the defendant's desire or conscious objective to do\nthe act complained about by the State.\n\n\n                  \"The elements of aggravated assault are as follows:\n\n\n                  1. The defendant knowingly placed Rowena Irani in reasonable\n          apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\n                  2. The defendant did so with a deadly weapon.\n                  3. This act occurred on or about the 3rd day of October, 2016, in\n          Sedgwick County, Kansas.\n\n\n                  \"A defendant acts knowingly when the defendant is aware of the nature\n          of his conduct that the State complains about.\n\n\n                  \"No bodily contact is necessary.\n\n\n                  \"A deadly weapon is an instrument which, from the manner in which it is\n          used, is calculated or likely to produce death or serious bodily injury. An object\n          can be a deadly weapon if the user intended to convince a person that it is a\n          deadly weapon and that person reasonably believed it to be a deadly weapon.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fOwens did not object to this instruction.\n\n\n       The district judge also included a limiting instruction addressing the \"dug a hole\"\ncomment.\n\n\n                      \"Evidence has been admitted tending to suggest that the defendant\n              claimed to have considered an act of violence against a prior girlfriend. No\n              evidence has been admitted to establish that these acts actually occurred.\n\n\n                      \"Evidence that such a statement was allegedly made by the defendant to\n              Rowena Irani may be considered solely for the purpose of establishing the nature\n              of Ms. Irani's relationship with defendant and her state of mind in late September\n              2016 to October 3, 2016. It is not to be considered by you for any other purpose.\"\n\n\n       During Owens' closing, he did not deny shooting Rowena but argued that the\nshooting was \"a terrible accident\" and asked for a voluntary manslaughter conviction. He\npointed to his post-combat mental health issues to support his argument that the shooting\nwas unintentional because he was jumpy and paranoid.\n\n\n       During closing rebuttal, the State argued for an intentional first-degree murder\nconviction. The prosecutor addressed Owens' argument that his PTSD, traumatic brain\ninjury, and mental health issues contributed to the shooting. The prosecutor argued that\nthe medical records demonstrated Owens had not consistently sought treatment and had\nmissed scheduled appointments. The prosecutor also encouraged the jury to consider all\nthe evidence of premeditation and challenged Owens' account of the shooting.\n\n\n       The jury convicted Owens of first-degree felony murder and aggravated burglary.\nOwens was acquitted of first-degree premeditated murder. The district judge sentenced\nOwens to a hard 25 life sentence plus 43 months and ordered Owens to pay $7,470.64 in\nrestitution. Owens appealed his convictions and restitution order.\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                               ANALYSIS\n\n\nThe District Judge Did Not Abuse His Discretion in Admitting Challenged Evidence\n\n      Owens first challenges the district judge's admission of two sets of statements. The\nfirst statements are Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him about Owens' comments\nabout \"digging a hole\" for an ex-girlfriend. The second statements include a text\nexchange between Rowena and Rooshad where Rowena said, \"[M]om texted me saying\nshe had a strong feeling he was going to physically abuse me if I went back,\" and texts\nfrom the same chain between Rowena and Rooshad involving the emojis and the\ncomment \"what's the worse that'll happen hell take a rifle and shoot me.\" Owens claims\nboth sets of statements constituted inadmissible hearsay and were unduly prejudicial.\n\n\n      Standard of Review\n\n\n      \"'This court reviews a trial court's determination that hearsay is admissible under a\n      statutory exception . . . for an abuse of discretion.' State v. Summers, 293 Kan. 819, 827,\n      272 P.3d 1 (2012). 'A district court abuses its discretion if its decision is (1) arbitrary,\n      fanciful, or unreasonable; (2) based on an error of law; or (3) based on an error of fact.'\n      State v.

State v. Satchell, 311 Kan.\n633, 640-41, 466 P.3d 459 (2020); State v. Huddleston, 298 Kan. 941, 962, 318 P.3d 140\n(2014).\n\n\n       The \"Dug a Hole\" Comments\n\n\n       The State sought to admit Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him that Owens\nsaid he \"dug a hole\" for a previous ex-girlfriend. The State offered this testimony to\nestablish Rowena's state of mind and the fact that she would not have willingly let Owens\ninto her home\u2014which supported the \"entering a dwelling without authority\" element of\naggravated burglary. Owens objected to the admission of this testimony, claiming it did\nnot fit within the statutory hearsay exception, particularly when Rooshad could be\nmotivated by animosity to distort the statements. Owens also argued the evidence should\nbe excluded because it was not relevant and was more prejudicial than probative.\n\n\n       The district judge found the testimony admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d) because it went to Rowena's state of mind and the fact that Owens would not have\nbeen welcome in her home. The district judge ruled:\n\n\n               \"So I do think\u2014and I understand that the defense doesn't want to be defending\n       against another alleged incident that may or may not have occurred. And I also\n       understand and appreciate why the State wants to introduce this. It goes to her state of\n       mind. It also goes to why she would have said, 'I don't want to have anything to do with\n       you anymore.'\n\n\n               \"And it also goes to the fact that he would not have had permission to go into her\n       residence, which may be an issue, because oftentimes, a boyfriend or a girlfriend would\n       have permission to come into a residence of a parent or a family member. So under the\n       analysis, under 60-460(d), I'm going to find that the statement is admissible.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\f       Rooshad's testimony about Owens' \"dug a hole\" comment may qualify as double\nhearsay. Therefore, each layer must be analyzed to determine its admissibility. See\nK.S.A. 60-463 (\"A statement within the scope of an exception to K.S.A. 60-460 shall not\nbe inadmissible on the ground that it includes a statement made by another declarant and\nis offered to prove the truth of the included statement if such included statement itself\nmeets the requirements of an exception.\").\n\n\n       The first layer is Owens' declaration to Rowena that he \"dug a hole\" for an ex-\ngirlfriend. The State never offered this statement for the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that\nis, to argue that Owens did in fact dig a grave for an ex-girlfriend. Indeed, the State\nwillingly agreed to an instruction that \"[n]o evidence has been admitted to establish that\nthese acts actually occurred.\" Thus, this first layer is not hearsay. See K.S.A. 2020 Supp.\n60-460 (hearsay evidence is \"[e]vidence of a statement which is made other than by a\nwitness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the matter stated\").\n\n\n       The second layer\u2014Rowena's declaration conveying Owens' \"dug a hole\" comment\nto her brother\u2014is, however, hearsay because it was offered by the State to establish that\nOwens did indeed tell Rowena he dug a hole for his ex-girlfriend. The district judge\nfound the evidence admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d), which creates an\nexception to the general rule excluding hearsay for certain contemporaneous statements,\nincluding:\n\n\n       \"A statement which the judge finds was made: (1) While the declarant was perceiving\n       the event or condition which the statement narrates, describes or explains; (2) while the\n       declarant was under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception; or\n       (3) if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, by the declarant at a time when the matter\n       had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the declarant's recollection was\n       clear and was made in good faith prior to the commencement of the action and with no\n       incentive to falsify or to distort.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    16\n\f       On appeal, Owens argues this conversation was inadmissible hearsay because the\nState did not establish that the statement was \"(1) contemporaneous, made by Rowena\nwhen the matter had been recently perceived and while her recollection was clear, and\n(2) made in good faith with no incentive to falsify or to distort.\" Further, Owens argues\nthat \"[a]ny probative value was outweighed by unduly prejudicial effect.\"\n\n\n       Ultimately, Owens fails to establish that the district judge abused his discretion by\nadmitting the \"dug a hole\" evidence under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d) and finding that\nthe probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by the risk of\nunfair prejudice under K.S.A. 60-445.\n\n\n       The district judge's admission of the testimony under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d) did not constitute a mistake of law or fact; nor was it arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable. Lemmie, 311 Kan. at 449-50. As noted, K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3)\nprovides for admission of testimony where the statement is made by a declarant: (1) who\nis unavailable as a witness; (2) at a time when the matter had been recently perceived and\nthe declarant's recollection clear; and (3) with no incentive to falsify or distort.\n\n\n       The record establishes that the challenged evidence satisfies all three statutory\nrequirements for admission. First, Rowena was unavailable because she had been\nmurdered. See State v. Robinson, 293 Kan. 1002, 1025, 270 P.3d 1183 (2012)\n(concluding that murder victim \"clearly was unavailable as a witness\").\n\n\n       The record also supports the district judge's finding that the statements were\ncontemporaneous. The State's evidence indicated that Rowena told Rooshad about\nOwens' \"dug a hole\" comments about one week after Owens made them to her. No\nevidence suggests Rowena's recollection was unclear after having perceived Owens'\nstatements several days prior. In fact, the testimony established that Rowena took Owens'\nstatements seriously, and it is reasonable to infer from this evidence that the statements\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmade a lasting impression upon her. The district judge did not abuse his discretion by\nconcluding that Rowena recounted this conversation to Rooshad \"at a time when the\nmatter had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the declarant's recollection\nwas clear.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3); see State v. Evans, 313 Kan. 972, 986-87,\n492 P.3d 418 (2021) (statements made in the year leading up to murder were \"close\nenough in time to be considered contemporaneous.\").\n\n\n       Finally, Owens speculates that Rowena might have had incentive to distort the\nstatements to justify to her brother the decision to end the relationship with Owens.\nHowever, Rooshad's testimony reasonably inferred that Rowena's account was genuine\nand she took Owens' statements seriously. No evidence suggests Rowena made these\nstatements in bad faith or with an incentive to falsify or distort them. See Robinson, 293\nKan. at 1026 (concluding district court did not abuse discretion where evidence did not\nsupport declarant's assertion that declarant made statements in bad faith). We find no\nerror in the admission of this evidence under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3).\n\n\n       With respect to the probative value and undue prejudice analysis, K.S.A. 60-445,\nprovides:\n\n\n               \"Except as in this article otherwise provided, the judge may in his or her\n       discretion exclude evidence if he or she finds that its probative value is substantially\n       outweighed by the risk that its admission will unfairly and harmfully surprise a party who\n       has not had reasonable opportunity to anticipate that such evidence would be offered.\"\n\n\n\"While [K.S.A. 60-445] talks only of the risk of unfair surprise, it has long been applied\nmuch more broadly\u2014excluding evidence if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.\" Satchell, 311 Kan. at 640. In reviewing this\nissue, we remain mindful that Kansas law favors the admission of relevant evidence, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n\fthe exclusion of relevant evidence under K.S.A. 60-445 is an extraordinary remedy that\nshould be used sparingly. State v. Ross, 310 Kan. 216, 224, 445 P.3d 726 (2019).\n\n\n       Here, the district judge found the testimony was probative because it tended to\nestablish Rowena's state of mind and that she would not have allowed Owens into her\nhome. In turn, such evidence was probative of the third element of aggravated burglary,\nwhether defendant entered an occupied dwelling without permission. See K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 21-5807(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A). Owens argues that Rooshad's \"dug a hole\" testimony\nwas more prejudicial than probative because it suggested to the jury that Owens had a\nhistory of violence towards partners, and it had little probative value because Rowena's\nstate of mind was not a material fact in dispute.\n\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the district judge's conclusion that the probative\nvalue of this testimony was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the risk of unfair prejudice.\nFirst, the district judge correctly observed that Rowena's account of Owens' statements\ntended to support the conclusion that Rowena would not have allowed Owens into her\nhome, a fact relevant to an essential element of the aggravated burglary count. The State\nhad the burden to prove this essential element at trial, even if Owens did not affirmatively\ncontrovert the element or Rowena's state of mind. The testimony was also probative of\nthe nature of the relationship between Rowena and Owens during the days leading up to\nher death, explaining possible motive for Owens' conduct and behavior. See Evans, 313\nKan. at 989 (evidence providing background context of the parties' relationship was\nprobative of defendant's motive that supplied \"the jury with some degree of explanation,\nresponding to a juror's natural tendency to wonder why a defendant behaved in the\nmanner described by the State\").\n\n\n       Additionally, the admission of this testimony was not unduly prejudicial. Owens'\n\"dug a hole\" story had already been presented to the jury through Owens' interrogation\nvideo and Detective Chisholm's testimony, and Owens does not challenge the admission\n\n\n                                             19\n\fof this evidence on appeal. So the only new information that came from Rooshad's\ntestimony was that Owens had told Rowena the same story.\n\n\n         The district judge also gave a cautionary jury instruction stating that \"no evidence\n[had] been admitted to establish\" that Owens actually dug a hole for his ex-girlfriend. The\ninstruction made clear that \"[e]vidence that such a statement was allegedly made\" could\n\"be considered solely for the purpose of establishing the nature of Ms. Irani's relationship\nwith defendant and her state of mind in late September 2016 to October 3, 2016.\" Jurors\nwere directed not to consider this evidence \"for any other purpose.\" See State v. Dean,\n310 Kan. 848, 862-63, 450 P.3d 819 (2019) (prejudicial effect of defendant's affiliation\nwith gangs may be cured by a limiting instruction); see also State v. Navarro, 272 Kan.\n573, 582, 35 P.3d 802 (2001) (\"The general rule is that an admonition to the jury\nnormally cures the prejudice from an improper admission of evidence.\").\n\n\n         Under these facts, the district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that\nthe evidence was admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d) or by finding the\ntestimony did not cause unfair prejudice that would \"substantially outweigh\" its probative\nvalue.\n\n\n         Text Messages Between Rowena and Rooshad\n\n\n         On appeal, Owens challenges the admission of the following text messages:\n\n\n               Rowena to Rooshad: \"mom texted me saying she had a strong feeling he was\n                                      going to physically abuse me if i went back\"\n                Rowena to Rooshad: \"what's the worse that'll happen hell take a rifle and shoot\n                                      me [emoji smiling with bead of sweat on forehead]\"\n                Rooshad to Rowena: \"Shut up\"\n                Rowena to Rooshad: [three emojis smiling with beads of sweat on foreheads]\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\f              Rowena to Rooshad: in response to Rooshad's screenshot of Owens' texts to\n                                      Rooshad:\n                                      \"getting on my fuckin nerves\"; [emoji smiling with sweat\n                                      on forehead; gun emoji pointed at other emoji].\"\n\n\n      Before trial, the State argued these messages again went to Rowena's state of mind\nand that she would not have willingly let Owens into her home. The defense argued that\nthe messages showed Rowena was joking and considered the idea that Owens posed a\nthreat preposterous. Also before trial, Owens opposed admission of this text message\nchain on two grounds. His counsel stated:\n\n\n              \"So I have an objection to State's 121 [the pretrial exhibit containing these text\n      messages], twofold: One, the reference to: 'What's he going to do, take a rifle and shoot\n      me?' If it goes to her state of mind, then her state of mind is, 'What's the worst he could\n      do? It's not going to happen.' And then she laughs about it with three laughing emojis to\n      the point where the emoji is crying.\n\n\n              \"And then the following page, it talks about a story of her life being that he's\n      wanting to get back together with her, and that [Owens] is getting on her fucking nerves,\n      and so she wants to shoot herself in the head. I would argue under the facts of this case,\n      where my client is accused of intentionally shooting her in the head, that those are\n      certainly more prejudicial than probative.\"\n\n\n      At trial, Owens did not make any new arguments objecting to the admission of\nthese texts, but instead \"renew[ed] [his] previous hearsay objections.\" Like Rooshad's\ntestimony, the district judge ruled that the texts were admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp.\n60-460(d). On appeal, Owens argues that these texts \"had limited probative value\" and\nwere \"cumulative and unnecessary and very prejudicial.\"\n\n\n      To begin with, Owens' trial objection to the \"strong feeling he was going to\nphysically abuse me\" text message was only to voice a difference of opinion on how the\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fevidence should be interpreted. Owens did not lodge specific objection to the\nadmissibility of this text message at trial. By challenging the \"strong feeling\" text as\nunduly prejudicial on appeal, Owens' argument is akin to objecting on one ground below\nand arguing a different one on appeal. We have consistently held that such arguments are\nnot preserved properly for appeal. See State v. Dukes, 290 Kan. 485, 488, 231 P.3d 558\n(2010) (\"Recently, we stated that 'the trial court must be provided the specific objection\nso it may consider as fully as possible whether the evidence should be admitted and\ntherefore reduce the chances of reversible error.' Specifically, in Richmond we refused to\nallow the defendant to object on one ground at trial and then argue another on appeal.\n[Citation omitted.]\"). Because Owens did not specifically object to this text message\ncommunication at trial, the district court was never given the opportunity to fully\nconsider its admissibility. We will not consider Owens' unpreserved arguments about the\n\"strong feeling\" text. State v. Gaona, 293 Kan. 930, 954, 270 P.3d 1165 (2012) (\"If a\nparty fails to make a specific contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence or\ntestimony at trial, objection to that evidence or testimony is not preserved for appeal.\").\n\n\n       Second, the hearsay objection that Owens did preserve is unfounded. The analysis\nharkens us back to the definition of hearsay: \"Evidence of a statement which is made\nother than by a witness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the\nmatter stated.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460. Most of the remaining messages in the\nchallenged texts were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted because they are not\ndeclarations and do not assert any matter. The \"what's the worse that'll happen\"\nstatement, though ominous, was not offered by the State to show that this was indeed the\nworst thing that could happen, or that Rowena believed it was the worst thing that could\nhappen. Instead, it was offered as insight to Rowena's state of mind. Furthermore, this\nwas a rhetorical question that did not attempt to establish the truth of any asserted matter.\n\n\n       Similarly, Owens fails to make a case on appeal that the emojis\u2014specifically the\nsmiling one with the bead of sweat and the gun directed at it\u2014contain or express the truth\n\n\n                                             22\n\fof a matter being asserted. Thus, the emojis cannot be characterized as hearsay\nstatements.\n\n\n       The only message from this group of texts that can be properly characterized as\nbeing offered for the truth of the matter asserted was Rowena's statement \"getting on my\nfuckin nerves,\" which is an assertion that Owens was bothering her. Nevertheless, the\ndistrict judge found that these messages, to the extent they were hearsay, were admissible\nunder K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d), finding: \"She is perceiving the matter about which\nthe statements are made while her recollection is clear.\"\n\n\n       We hold the district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that the\nportions of these texts that were hearsay, if any, were admissible under K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 60-460(d)(3), the contemporaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule. This\ndeclaration (\"getting on my fuckin nerves\") explains Rowena's state of mind moments\nafter Rooshad forwarded her a screenshot of Owens' texts. In turn, this state of mind\nevidence provided insight into the nature of her relationship with Owens leading up to the\nshooting. And Owens has not established on appeal that Rowena had incentive to falsify\nor distort this reaction. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\ntext messages under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3).\n\n\n       With respect to the K.S.A. 60-445 probative value and prejudice concerns, we find\nno abuse of discretion in the district judge's conclusion that the probative value of the\ntexts was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the threat of unfair prejudice. As with\nRooshad's testimony above, the text messages were probative because a juror could\nreasonably infer from them that Rowena would not have given Owens permission to\nenter her family's home. The evidence was also probative of Owens' motive. In turn,\nOwens fails to explain why the emoji text messages were unfairly prejudicial in his brief\non appeal. This court cannot independently develop an argument for prejudice on Owens'\nbehalf. See State v. Lowery, 308 Kan. 1183, 1231, 427 P.3d 865 (2018) (\"'A point raised\n\n\n                                              23\n\fincidentally in a brief and not argued therein is deemed abandoned.'\"). Accordingly, we\nconclude the district judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying the Mistrial Motions\n\n\n       Owens next argues the district judge committed reversible error by twice denying\nhis requests for a mistrial. Owens first moved for a mistrial on the first day of trial. He\nargued the State surprised him during opening argument when it first disclosed that\nDetective Chisholm had performed a reconstruction using Owens' sling and gun and\nclaimed this reconstruction would show Owens' account of the shooting was implausible.\n\n\n       Owens renewed his motion later in the trial when the State failed to redact the\nrecording of a phone call between a detective and Owens' mother, wherein Owens'\nmother said she wanted to consult with an attorney before consenting to law\nenforcement's search of her house. The district judge denied both requests. We address\neach request in turn.\n\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n\n       This court explained the procedure and applicable standard of review for mistrial\nrequests in State v. Waller, 299 Kan. 707, 725-26, 328 P.3d 1111 (2014):\n\n\n               \"Under K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c), a trial court may declare a mistrial if there was\n       prejudicial conduct either inside or outside the courtroom that makes it impossible for the\n       trial to proceed without injustice to either the defendant or the prosecution. This statute\n       creates a two-step process. First, the trial court must determine if there was some\n       fundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, the trial court moves to the second step and\n       assesses whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. In other words, the trial\n       court must decide if the prejudicial conduct's damaging effect can be removed or\n       mitigated by an admonition, jury instruction, or other action. If not, the trial court must\n\n\n\n                                                    24\n\f       determine whether the degree of prejudice results in an injustice and, if so, declare a\n       mistrial. State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, 550, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied [565 U.S.\n       1221] (2012); see State v. Race, 293 Kan. 69, 80, 259 P.3d 707 (2011).\n\n\n               \"In Ward, our court articulated this standard by dividing the appellate court's\n       abuse of discretion inquiry into two parts, asking: (1) Did the trial court abuse its\n       discretion when deciding if there was a fundamental failure in the proceeding? and (2)\n       Did the trial court abuse its discretion when deciding whether the conduct resulted in\n       prejudice that could not be cured or mitigated through jury admonition or instruction,\n       resulting in an injustice? 292 Kan. at 551.\"\n\n\n       Generally, where, as here, a defendant alleges the district court erred by not\ngranting a mistrial, the defendant bears the burden of proving that his or her substantial\nrights to a fair trial were prejudiced. State v. Sappington, 285 Kan. 158, 173, 169 P.3d\n1096 (2007).\n\n\n       The First Mistrial Motion\n\n\n       The portion of the opening statement at issue in Owens' first motion for mistrial is\nas follows:\n\n\n       \"So Detective Chisholm will tell you a couple of things about the statement that Mr.\n       Owens gives to him. His explanation for everything is that his gun was in the sling, and it\n       just went off. I don't know what happened. It just went off.\n\n\n               \"What you'll also hear him tell Detective Chisholm is that he shoots with his left\n       hand; the one that didn't have the surgery. But on this occasion, the gun was in his right\n       hand, in the sling somehow.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      25\n\f           \"So what the police did is when Dane was arrested, they took that sling and put it\ninto evidence. They were able to find the gun. They never found the magazine. They\nnever found the live round. They never found Rowena's phone. But they did find the\nfirearm.\n\n\n           \"Detective Chisholm has been with the homicide unit probably 25 years. He\nknows more about guns than most people will, in his experience personally and through\nlaw enforcement. But he also sent the gun to the Forensic Science Center for the firearms\nexaminer to look at it and compare it with the bullet that they had found to see what\ninformation he could give. And the firearms examiner will tell you that the trigger pull\ntakes seven pounds. . . .\n\n\n           \"But what Detective Chisholm did is when he's in the interview with Mr.\nOwens\u2014and you'll see it\u2014but there's a part where he tries to explain how this gun was in\nthe sling. So Detective Chisholm, on his own time and when he has the gun and has the\nsling, puts it on him and tries to see if this is feasible. And what he found out is that gun\nwon't fit. And if the gun won't fit, the mechanism to discharge the cartridge wouldn't\nwork right. And you will hear and you will see this as well.\"\n\n\nOwens requested a mistrial, stating:\n\n\n           \"During the course of the State's opening statement, we were told for the first\ntime that apparently the case agent conducted some experiment on a piece of evidence\nand then reached certain conclusions that the story couldn't have been the way my client\nsaid it because of the way the casing was ejected from the firearm. There has been no\nreport provided on any kind of scientific or experimental testing by the State. I certainly\nhaven't been given so much as an email about it, so I move for mistrial at this time.\nThey've already told the jury about some piece of evidence that I have never been told\nabout. Apparently, it's some kind of test done by the case agent that he hasn't written a\nreport on. I'd be shocked if there wasn't an email from somewhere saying, 'Hey, fellows,\nthis is what I did and this is what happened.' So I believe it's a blatant discovery violation\nand I move for mistrial.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       The State countered that Detective Chisholm had just conducted this\nreconstruction the Friday before trial began (on the following Tuesday) and it would\nquestion Detective Chisholm about this issue on the stand. Further, the State highlighted\nthat both the gun and the sling were going to be admitted as evidence, and Kansas law\npermitted the jury to take both the gun and the sling back into the jury room where jurors\ncould conduct the same experiment of their own accord, if they wished.\n\n\n       The district judge denied the request for a mistrial, reasoning:\n\n\n       \"I don't see it as a scientific experiment. I don't see it as expert testimony; and the remedy\n       for finding this out during opening statement which, again, I would state they could have\n       just had Detective Chisholm testify and done it right there and then, and it could have\n       been something that came to them during the direct examination of Detective Chisholm,\n       with the items here and have him try it.\n\n\n                \"But also, then, if the defense wants an opportunity before Detective Chisholm\n       testifies to see what and how he did this examination of the evidence, I will allow for\n       that.\"\n\n\nThe defense confirmed that it wanted the opportunity to see Detective Chisholm's\ndemonstration and examination before he testified.\n\n\n       On direct examination, the State highlighted Detective Chisholm's familiarity with\nand expertise in firearms but did not designate him as an expert. Over the defense's\nobjection, Detective Chisholm demonstrated his reenactment for the jury, putting on the\nsling, holding the gun, and explaining that he did not believe Owens' account of the\nshooting was true because if the gun were in the sling, the casing would not have ended\nup on the staircase where crime scene technicians ultimately found it. The defense cross-\nexamined him about his reenactment and conclusions. Detective Chisholm admitted that\nhe \"wouldn't say that [he] had any real findings\" based on the demonstration. He also\n\n\n                                                    27\n\fobserved that there were no burns on the sling, but he admitted the sling was not tested\nfor gunpowder residue.\n\n\n       On appeal, Owens argues that the \"surprise\" in the State's opening statement was\nfundamentally unfair because the defense was \"unprepared to counter the evidence that\nthe State had just proffered.\" The State counters that no fundamental unfairness occurred\nbecause the evidence the State promised \"was no different than what the jury witnessed\ndefendant demonstrating on video during his interview, and no different than what the\ndetective illustrated during his own testimony before the jury.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the State used Detective Chisholm as more or less a pseudo-expert,\noutlining his experience with firearms and expertise in their function, despite never\nformally designating him an expert. Because Detective Chisholm was never officially\ndesignated an expert, the State did not disclose to the defense his \"demonstration,\" his\nqualifications, or any of the underlying grounds or basis supporting the reliability of his\nopinions. We presume without deciding that the failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's\ndemonstration before trial was a fundamental failure in the proceeding. See Waller, 299\nKan. at 725.\n\n\n       Presuming error, we move to the second step of the analysis and determine\nwhether such a fundamental failure \"caused prejudice that could not be cured or mitigated\nthrough jury admonition or instruction or other means, resulting in an injustice.\" State v.\nCorey, 304 Kan. 721, 730, 374 P.3d 654 (2016). Owens argues that \"[f]undamental\nfairness would have allowed the defense, pretrial, to seek its own firearms 'familiar'\nwitness demonstration, taking into account Mr. Owens' unique physique.\" As the State\npoints out, Owens was \"never deprived of such an opportunity.\" His defense, dating back\nto the initial interrogation, was always that he fired the gun by accident. He could have\nhired an expert at any point to bolster this theory by showing that his accidental-shooting-\nfrom-inside-the-sling theory was feasible. See State v. White, 284 Kan. 333, 343, 161\n\n\n                                             28\n\fP.3d 208 (2007) (district court did not err in denying mistrial motion where prosecutor's\nfailure to disclose change in expert testimony did not destroy, or even change, the theory\nof defense), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in State v. McLinn,\n307 Kan. 307, 320, 409 P.3d 1 (2018).\n\n\n       Owens also argues that a mistrial was required because \"the defense was\nunprepared to rebut the new evidence and the bells could not be unrung.\" We disagree.\nThe defense was given the opportunity to meet with Detective Chisholm before he\ntestified to examine him about his demonstration. The defense thoroughly cross-\nexamined Detective Chisholm about the demonstration on the stand. Insomuch as the\ndefense was caught off-guard by the State's opening, we cannot say this resulted in\nincurable prejudice. Further, as to the prosecutor's opening remarks, the jury was\nappropriately instructed that \"[s]tatements, arguments, and remarks of counsel are\nintended to help you in understanding the evidence and in applying the law, but they are\nnot evidence. If any statements are made that are not supported by evidence, they should\nbe disregarded.\" See State v. Kleypas, 305 Kan. 224, Syl. \u00b6 16, 382 P.3d 373 (2016)\n(Generally, we presume juries follow a court's instructions, and a defendant must come\nforward with some evidence to overcome the presumption to demonstrate grounds for\nmistrial.).\n\n\n       The State's failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's reconstruction did not result in\nincurable prejudice, resulting in an injustice. We hold that the district judge did not abuse\nhis discretion by denying Owens' request for mistrial.\n\n\n       The Second Mistrial Motion\n\n\n       Owens lodged his second motion for a mistrial after the State played an\nunredacted version of a recorded phone call between police and Owens' mother. Before\nplaying the recording, the State represented to the defense and to the court that it had\n\n\n                                             29\n\fredacted the portion of the tape where Owens' mother said she wanted to consult an\nattorney in response to a detective's request to search her home. Yet, the recording that\nthe State played was not redacted. Owens moved for a mistrial because \"[w]e were told,\nspecifically, that that information would not be played in front of the jury, and it was.\"\n\n\n       The district judge denied the request, reasoning:\n\n\n               \"The evidence that was presented\u2014the issue is Ms. Owens saying that she wasn't\n       sure she wanted the police to search their house and asking if she needed a lawyer, which\n       the question really is whether it is admissible or not as it relates to Mr. Owens, who is on\n       trial. It is evidence that the parties had agreed would not come in. It did come in, and if it\n       is admissible evidence, it is not overly prejudicial to this defendant, because it does not\n       affect any rights that he, himself, exerted. He, at that time, was 27 some-odd-years old.\"\n\n\nThe district judge also offered a limiting instruction directing jurors to disregard Owens'\nmother's comment about an attorney. Owens declined the instruction, motivated by a\ndesire to \"not ring the bell again.\"\n\n\n       We again return to the two-step framework from Waller, 299 Kan. at 725-26.\nFirst, we consider whether the district judge abused his discretion by finding no\nfundamental failure in the proceeding had occurred. Owens argues the district judge \"did\nnot address the unfairness to the defense. Instead, [Owens claims] the court minimized\nthe damage, stating it was 'not shocking' that [Owens' mother] was reluctant to agree to a\nsearch of her home.\" Moreover, Owens suggests \"[a]ny implication that Mr. Owens'\nfamily had something to hide, or were protecting him, was damaging to his defense,\nwhich was based on credibility.\"\n\n\n       We hold that the district judge did not abuse his discretion by finding that the\npresentation of the unredacted tape was not a fundamental failure in the proceedings. A\njury could reasonably understand why Owens' mother may have wanted to consult with\n\n\n                                                    30\n\fan attorney before agreeing to a search of her home. The jury's knowledge that Owens'\nmother wanted an attorney's advice did not amount to a fundamental failure. See, e.g.,\nState v. Rice, 261 Kan. 567, 593, 932 P.2d 981 (1997) (The district judge did not abuse\nhis discretion by denying a motion for mistrial after a police officer testified that the\ndefendant invoked his right to counsel, where \"jury was told to draw no negative\nimplication from Rice's decision not to talk with police before talking with his attorney\nand no further mention of the incident was made.\"). And Owens fails to establish that any\nprejudicial inference would have been attributed to him, rather than his mother. Finally,\nthe district judge offered a limiting instruction here, but Owens declined it.\n\n\n       Because we find no error in the district court's conclusion that there was no\nfundamental failure in the proceedings, we need not proceed to the second step and\nconsider prejudice. Accordingly, we hold that the district judge did not commit reversible\nerror by denying Owens' motions for mistrial.\n\n\nThe Aggravated Burglary Instruction Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n\n       Owens next argues that the district judge committed reversible instructional error.\nSpecifically, he challenges the definition of \"knowingly\" that the district judge provided\nin the aggravated burglary instruction.\n\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n\n               \"This court follows a four-step progression when reviewing challenges to jury\n       instructions: First, it considers the reviewability of the issue from both jurisdiction and\n       preservation viewpoints, exercising an unlimited standard of review; next, it applies\n       unlimited review to determine whether the instruction was legally appropriate; then, it\n       determines whether there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\n       the defendant or the requesting party, that would have supported the instruction; and\n       finally, if the district court erred, this court determines whether the error was harmless,\n\n\n                                                    31\n\f       utilizing the test and degree of certainty set forth in State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, 256\n       P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied 565 U.S. 1221 (2012).\" State v. Claerhout, 310 Kan. 924,\n       935-36, 453 P.3d 855 (2019).\n\n\n       However, if a defendant fails to object to the instructional error below, the clear\nerror standard is applied to assess prejudice. Instructional error is clearly erroneous when\n\"'the reviewing court is firmly convinced that the jury would have reached a different\nverdict had the instruction error not occurred.'\" State v. Dominguez, 299 Kan. 567, 574,\n328 P.3d 1094 (2014).\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       The State argues that Owens is not entitled to relief on this front because he not\nonly assented to the district judge's proposed instruction containing the challenged\ndefinition of \"knowingly,\" but in fact invited the error by requesting the same definition\nin his proposed instructions. The invited error argument is baseless because Owens\nproposed this definition of \"knowingly\" in the context of an instruction titled \"homicide\ndefinitions,\" not as part of the instruction on the elements for aggravated burglary and\naggravated assault. Owens therefore did not invite the error he now complains of, that is,\nthe district court's definition of \"knowingly\" in the aggravated burglary instruction.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, Owens did not object to the district court's instruction at trial. Thus,\nthe clear error framework applies. State v. Boeschling, 311 Kan. 124, 131, 458 P.3d 234\n(2020) (\"[T]he clear error framework applies when a party fails to object to an instruction\nbelow but claims that instruction is error on appeal.\").\n\n\n       The State charged Owens with aggravated burglary. Under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-\n5807(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A), the elements of aggravated burglary are:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    32\n\f       1. Without authority\n       2. Entering a dwelling\n       3. While another person was inside said dwelling\n       4. With the intent to commit a felony therein.\n\n\n       The felony that the State alleged Owens intended to commit inside the home\n(under the fourth element of aggravated burglary) was aggravated assault. K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 21-5412 defines aggravated assault as \"knowingly placing another person in\nreasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm\" using a deadly weapon. Thus, the\nculpable mental state for aggravated assault is \"knowingly.\"\n\n\n       Owens argues that the district judge erred by instructing the jury, with respect to\nthe aggravated assault underlying the aggravated burglary, that \"[a] defendant acts\nknowingly when the defendant is aware of the nature of his conduct that the State\ncomplains about.\" This is PIK Crim 4th 52.010 option 1 for the definition of\n\"knowingly.\" Owens contends the district judge should have instructed the jury that a\ndefendant acts knowingly \"'when he or she was aware that his or her conduct was\nreasonably certain to cause the result.'\" This is PIK Crim 4th 52.010 option 3 for the\ndefinition of \"knowingly.\"\n\n\n       We disagree because the district court's instruction was legally appropriate. In this\ncase, any distinction between the two definitions of \"knowingly\" is one without legal\nsignificance. The definition of \"knowingly\" in the instruction as given meant that the jury\nhad to find that Owens was aware of the nature of the conduct of which the State\ncomplains. In other words, Owens had to be aware that his conduct was reasonably\ncertain to put Rowena in fear. Defendant's proposed definition of \"knowingly\" conveyed\nthe same meaning. The district court's denial of the requested instruction was not clearly\nerroneous because the instruction as given properly and fairly stated the law as applied to\nthe facts of the case. See State v. Pabst, 273 Kan. 658, 659, 44 P.3d 1230 (2002) (where\n\n\n                                             33\n\fdistrict court denies requested instruction, appellate court focuses inquiry on whether\ninstruction given properly and fairly stated the law as applied to the facts of the case).\n\n\n       Furthermore, the record was rife with evidence of Owens' \"knowledge,\" i.e., that\nOwens was aware that his conduct would place Rowena in reasonable apprehension of\nimmediate bodily harm. Based on Owens' own account of the incident during\ninterrogation, he decided to park down the street, rather than in Rowena's driveway, to\navoid detection. Owens entered Rowena's house with a gun to be \"take[n] . . . seriously.\"\nHe carried the gun in the sling, without concealing it entirely, because he wanted Rowena\nto know he had a gun. He said he was \"pissed\" at Rowena because she did not give him a\n\"legitimate explanation\" for the breakup. Based on this evidence, we are not firmly\nconvinced that the jury would have reached a different verdict under Owens' requested\ninstruction.\n\n\n       For these reasons, the district court's aggravated burglary instruction was legally\nproper, factually appropriate, and not clearly erroneous.\n\n\nThe Prosecutor Committed Harmless Error in Closing\n\n\n       Owens next argues that the State committed reversible prosecutorial error. First,\nOwens complains that the prosecutor inappropriately used the \"dug a hole\" evidence to\n\"show propensity and character through conduct\" in closing. Further, Owens complains\nthat the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence by referencing missed mental health\nappointments that were not actually supported by admitted evidence. We address each\ncomplaint in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f       Standard of Review\n\n\n                \"In considering a claim of prosecutorial error, [the court] follow[s] a two-step\n       analysis. [It] first determine[s] whether an error occurred. Second, if an error has been\n       found, [it] evaluate[s] the prejudice [the error] caused to determine whether it was\n       harmless. At the first step, error occurs if the appellate court determines the prosecutor's\n       actions or statements 'fall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors to conduct the\n       State's case and attempt to obtain a conviction in a manner that does not offend the\n       defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial.' A criminal defendant establishes the first\n       prong by establishing the prosecutor misstated the law or argued a fact or factual\n       inferences with no evidentiary foundation. [Citations omitted.]\" State v. Ballou, 310 Kan.\n       591, 596, 448 P.3d 479 (2019).\n\n\n       The Prosecutor's Argument Regarding the \"Dug a Hole\" Evidence\n\n\n       Owens first challenges the prosecutor's reference to the \"dug a hole\" evidence. The\nchallenged portion of the State's closing provided:\n\n\n                \"What do we have? We have a guy who his roommates and his mom knows he\n       has a .45. That gun will not be found because it's not at his house. The cops don't know\n       that it's in the lake. They'll never find it, okay. It's not in Manhattan; it's not at his folks'\n       house. He has been told over and over again to stay away from her by her own brother\n       who is a cop. She has cut him off of her social media. He's in the Wichita area the day of\n       the shooting. He is alone. His family is not with him. No one is going to give him an\n       alibi. And we've got Marvin sitting in his driveway, and we'll have pictures that the cops\n       are going to find, because they did, of him going in and going out, and a car consistent\n       with his dad's truck. If I got no statement from him, is that the kind of circumstantial case\n       you would want to look at and give some weight to? He's the ex-boyfriend. He's breaking\n       up. His last words to her the last time they spoke was this whole business about, well, the\n       last girlfriend I had\u2014and tells that whole story. It's irrelevant if that's true. It's just a\n       weird thing to say to a girl you're trying to get back in touch with. 'Well, the last\n       girlfriend I had, I dug a hole for.'\n\n\n\n\n                                                       35\n\f              \"When tragedies happen people want to try to make sense of them.\"\n\n\n      The prosecutor went on:\n\n\n      \"It is not a unique story. He dated a girl. He wanted it to go in a direction she didn't. He's\n      talking marriage after six weeks, eight weeks. When she told him right off the bat,\n      'Brother, this is going to be fun, but I'm heading out of state.' And then told it was over.\n      He doesn't leave it alone. He tells her this crazy story; tells her what happened in war.\n\n\n              \"Her own family, her brother gets involved and says, 'Back off.' She defriends\n      him. He brings his gun from Manhattan. He takes it home and gets it loaded. He gets in\n      his dad's car and he drives to the house. Whether he was driving around or sitting and\n      waiting, okay. A whole lot of time passes while he's thinking about what he's going to do.\n      He could have turned around and headed back to Andover, or Manhattan for that matter.\n      But he chose to stay. He chose to park. He chose to walk up there. And he chose to have\n      that weapon out.\"\n\n\n      Owens claims the State used the \"dug a hole\" comments impermissibly \"to show\npropensity and character through conduct,\" and to \"inflame the passions or prejudices of\njurors.\" But he does not develop these arguments beyond these bare assertions.\n\n\n      To the contrary, the prosecutor's argument illustrated how Rooshad's testimony\n(that Owens told Rowena about the \"dug a hole\" story) controverted Owens' claim that he\nwent to Rowena's home just to talk about getting back together. Based on this testimony,\nthe prosecutor reasonably argued that after Owens told Rowena the \"dug a hole\" story, it\nwas unlikely that Owens was bewildered by Rowena's decision to end the relationship\nand that he entered her home only in search of Rowena's \"legitimate\" explanation for the\nbreakup. We hold that these comments were founded on reasonable inferences from the\nadmitted evidence and within the \"wide latitude\" afforded to prosecutors in closing\nargument. See State v. Longoria, 301 Kan. 489, 524, 343 P.3d 1128 (2015).\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f        The Prosecutor's Argument Regarding the Missed Medical Appointments\n\n\n        Next, Owens argues that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence in closing\nargument by claiming Owens missed several scheduled mental health appointments and\nreferencing, as support, medical records that were not admitted into evidence. During this\nsection of closing, the State attacked Owens' argument that his PTSD, traumatic brain\ninjury, and mental health issues caused him to accidentally fire the gun. The prosecutor\nsaid:\n\n\n                \"You're going to get all these stacks of records about all the efforts he went\n        through, and the VA was letting him down. And, you know, he's got PTSD and all these\n        things, and he's just not getting the help he wants. For what it's worth, if you want to pore\n        through them, page 120 of the Levine [sic] records, this is in May of '16, so what, just\n        three or four months before the act. 'The patient did not show up for his appointment.\n        This is his fourth consecutive no show.' This is a guy who is crying for help; he sure\n        misses a lot of appointments with his docs. Again, this is a pattern. It goes back to May of\n        '15. 157, I think it is, yeah. 'Patient did not show up for his appointment.'\n\n\n                \"'Patient did not show up for his appointment,' page 158.\n\n\n                \"He no-showed for his new patient appointment, page 177. Does that mean\n        anything? Does that mean he's guilty of murder? No. But as we're trying to\u2014as the\n        defense wants to put all of this into this notion that he's been to war. He's served his\n        country honorably. He came back a different man, and he's not getting the support and\n        help he wants, and that's why he was at this dire, dark place and this accident, this terrible\n        accident happened, well, take a good, hard look at that.\"\n\n\n        The State concedes that \"the medical records in the record on appeal do not\ncontain the page numbers referenced by the prosecutor.\" But the State attempts to smooth\nover the fact that the prosecutor's statements did not match up with the records in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      37\n\fevidence by arguing that the \"fact\" that Owens did not utilize medical help available to\nhim \"was indeed in evidence.\"\n\n\n       The State's argument is unconvincing. The prosecutor plainly argued facts not in\nevidence. The prosecutor said Owens' pattern of declining help \"goes back to May of\n'15.\" None of the record cites the State referenced to support the prosecutor's closing\nargument date back to May of 2015. The only admitted records from Lafene Health\nCenter in 2015 confirm that Owens did attend scheduled appointments, and none offer\nsupport for the prosecutor's argument. And the admitted Veterans Administration records\ndo not reflect any treatment provided or offered to Owens in 2015 at all.\n\n\n       Similarly, none of the record cites submitted by the State in its appellate brief deal\nwith a no-showed \"new patient\" appointment, which the prosecutor also claimed Owens\nmissed. \"[I]t is clearly improper for a prosecutor to state facts that are not in evidence.\"\nState v. Banks, 306 Kan. 854, 862, 397 P.3d 1195 (2017) (citing State v. Ly, 277 Kan.\n386, 393, 85 P.3d 1200 [2004]). Doing so exceeds the \"wide latitude\" afforded to\nprosecutors in closing. Ballou, 310 Kan. at 596. Thus, the prosecutor committed error\nduring closing argument, and we must proceed to the second step of the analysis \"to\ndetermine whether it was harmless.\" 310 Kan. at 596.\n\n\n       \"Prosecutorial error is harmless if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt the\nerror . . . did not affect the trial's outcome in light of the entire record, i.e., when there is\nno reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict.\" State v. Love, 305 Kan.\n716, 728, 387 P.3d 820 (2017) (citing State v. Sherman, 305 Kan. 88, 109, 378 P.3d 1060\n[2016]). The State contends the prosecutor's error does not warrant reversal of Owens'\nconvictions because any error is harmless. Ultimately, we agree with the State.\n\n\n       The State charged Owens with first-degree premeditated murder or, in the\nalternative, felony murder. Owens used the medical records to bolster his defense that\n\n\n                                                38\n\fOwens did not intend to pull the trigger and shoot Rowena, therefore, suggesting the\nkilling was accidental, not intentional and premeditated. The State's closing argument\nrelied on medical records not in evidence to challenge this defense.\n\n\n       Ultimately, the jury acquitted Owens of first-degree, premeditated murder and\nconvicted him under the alternate theory of felony murder, specifically a killing in the\ncommission of aggravated burglary. Owens' defense\u2014that he did not pull the trigger\nintentionally or with premeditation\u2014was not a legally viable defense to Owens' crime of\nconviction. Whether Owens intentionally pulled the trigger or did so accidentally makes\nno legal difference for purposes of felony murder. The jury did not have to find Owens\nintended to kill Rowena or acted with premeditation to convict him of felony murder; the\njury only had to find Owens killed Rowena while committing aggravated burglary. See\nState v. Mireles, 297 Kan. 339, 366, 301 P.3d 677 (2013) (\"[T]he elements of felony\nmurder do not include a killing that is intentional or done with premeditation.\"). And, as\ndiscussed previously, there is abundant evidence to support the jury's finding that Owens\nkilled Rowena during an aggravated burglary. Therefore, the prosecutorial error was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\nNo Cumulative Error\n\n\n       Owens contends he is entitled to a new trial because of cumulative error. This\ncourt may reverse a defendant's convictions for cumulative error \"when the totality of the\ncircumstances demonstrate that the defendant was substantially prejudiced by cumulative\nerrors and was denied a fair trial.\" State v. George, 311 Kan. 693, 709, 466 P.3d 469\n(2020) (citing State v. Holt, 300 Kan. 985, 1007, 336 P.3d 312 [2014]).\n\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\f       Standard of Review\n\n\n               \"The test is whether the errors substantially prejudiced the defendant and denied\n       the defendant a fair trial under the totality of the circumstances. See State v. Tully, 293\n       Kan. 176, 205-07, 262 P.3d 314 (2011). In making the assessment of whether the\n       cumulative errors are harmless error, an appellate court examines the errors in the context\n       of the record as a whole considering how the trial judge dealt with the errors as they arose\n       (including the efficacy, or lack of efficacy, of any remedial efforts); the nature and\n       number of errors committed and their interrelationship, if any; and the strength of the\n       evidence. See State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, 578, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied 132 S.\n       Ct. 1594 (2012). 'No prejudicial error may be found upon this cumulative effect rule . . .\n       if the evidence is overwhelming against the defendant.' State v. Colston, 290 Kan. 952,\n       Syl. \u00b6 15, 235 P.3d 1234 (2010); see, e.g., Alvarez v. Boyd, 225 F.3d 820, 824-25 (7th\n       Cir. 2000) (listing various factors to be considered in cumulative error analysis), cert.\n       denied 531 U.S. 1192 (2001); United States v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir.1998)\n       (same). Because the standard under Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824,\n       17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied 386 U.S. 987 (1967), applies to the three instances of\n       prosecutorial misconduct, '''the cumulative error must be harmless beyond a reasonable\n       doubt.''' Tully, 293 Kan. at 205 (quoting United States v. Toles, 297 F.3d 959, 972 [10th\n       Cir. 2002]).\" State v. Holt, 300 Kan. 985, 1007-08, 336 P.3d 312 (2014).\n\n\n       Here, we presumed (without deciding) error in the first step of the mistrial analysis\nbased on the State's failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's demonstration before trial.\nBut we concluded that the district court did not err by concluding the trial could proceed\nwithout injustice. We also held that the State committed prosecutorial error by stating\nfacts not in evidence during its closing argument. But we concluded this error was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\n       The presumed error and harmless prosecutorial error affected separate and distinct\nsubject matter and issues. The errors were not interrelated in a way that enhanced their\nprejudicial force. In other words, the cumulative impact of the errors is no greater than\nthe sum of their individual parts.\n\n                                                    40\n\f       Moreover, the weight of the evidence against Owens was remarkably strong. The\njury heard Owens' confession to shooting Rowena, after he entered her home without\npermission to intimidate her. The State supplemented the confession with substantial\ndirect and circumstantial evidence that convincingly established the elements of felony\nmurder and aggravated burglary. Given the negligible impact of the unrelated errors,\ncoupled with the strength of the State's evidence, we hold that the cumulative effect of\nthe errors was harmless beyond reasonable doubt and did not deny Owens a fair trial. See\nTully, 293 Kan. at 205-07.\n\n\nKansas' Criminal Restitution Scheme Implicates Section 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill\nof Rights\n\n\n       Finally, Owens argues that Kansas' criminal restitution scheme is unconstitutional.\nUnder that scheme, district court judges must order criminal defendants to pay restitution.\nThis restitution includes, but is not limited to, damage or loss caused by the defendant's\ncrime, as determined by the judge. See K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-6604(b)(1); K.S.A. 2016\nSupp. 21-6607(c)(2). Once the judge orders restitution, the statutory scheme converts the\naward into a civil judgment, which may be enforced the same as any other civil\njudgment. K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-6604(b)(2); K.S.A. 60-4301.\n\n\n       Owens argues this statutory scheme violates section 5 of the Kansas Constitution\nBill of Rights, which provides: \"The right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\" He contends\nthis guarantee preserved the common-law right to have juries determine damages in civil\ntort claims. According to Owens, the statutory restitution scheme effectively allows a\njudge, rather than a jury, to determine civil damages, thus implicating section 5. He\ntherefore asks this court to vacate his restitution order.\n\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f       Preservation\n\n\n       Owens admits he did not raise this constitutional challenge before the district\ncourt. Generally, we do not consider constitutional claims for the first time on appeal.\nState v. Daniel, 307 Kan. 428, 430, 410 P.3d 877 (2018). That said, we agree with Owens\nthat his claim meets one of the discretionary exceptions to this general rule\u2014that\nconsideration of the claim is necessary to serve the ends of justice or prevent the denial of\nfundamental rights. See State v. Dukes, 290 Kan. 485, 488, 231 P.3d 558 (2010).\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       Determining a statute's constitutionality is a question of law over which we have\nunlimited review. State v. Soto, 299 Kan. 102, 121, 322 P.3d 334 (2014).\n\n\n       The outcome here is controlled by our decision in Arnett. There, we held that the\ncurrent statutory restitution scheme violates section 5 by converting restitution orders, in\nwhich a judge determines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into civil\njudgments, thereby bypassing the traditional function of juries to determine civil\ndamages. Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18. Specifically, Arnett held that K.S.A. 60-\n4301; K.S.A. 60-4302; K.S.A. 60-4303; K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-6604(b)(2); and the last\nsentence of K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 22-3424(d)(1) violate section 5. However, we also held\nthat the proper remedy for this constitutional impropriety was to sever the offending\nportions of the statutory scheme rather than vacate every judicially determined restitution\norder. Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18.\n\n\n       Owens is thus correct that the criminal restitution statutory scheme implicates\nsection 5. However, once the unconstitutional provisions of that scheme are severed,\nOwens' original restitution judgment is constitutionally firm. He will not be subject to a\ncivil judgment for his criminal restitution unless it is obtained separately through a civil\n\n\n                                             42\n\fcause of action. See Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18. Thus, we affirm the district\ncourt's restitution order.\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n       DARYL D. AHLQUIST, District Judge, assigned.1\n\n\n                                            ***\n\n\n       ROSEN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: I agree with the majority's\nwell-reasoned decision affirming Owens' convictions. Consistent with my position in\nState v. Arnett, 314 Kan. ___ (No. 112,572, this day decided), and State v. Robison, 314\nKan. ___ (No. 120,903, this day decided), I dissent from the majority's conclusion that\nthe Kansas criminal restitution scheme does not violate the right to jury trial under\nsection 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. I would adopt the reasoning set forth\nin Judge Leben's dissent in State v. Robison, 58 Kan. App. 2d 380, 395, 469 P.3d 83\n(2020), and Justice Standridge's dissent that I joined in Arnett, slip op. at 19-36, to hold\nthat our criminal restitution statutes are unconstitutional because they allow a judge\u2014\nrather than a jury\u2014to determine how much a criminal defendant must pay in restitution. I\nwould vacate the restitution order entered in this case.\n\n\n\n\n1\nREPORTER'S NOTE: District Judge Daryl D.

But Kansas\nlaw favors the admission of relevant evidence, and the exclusion of relevant evidence\nunder K.S.A. 60-445 is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly.\n\n\n3.\n       Under K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c), a trial court may declare a mistrial if there was\nprejudicial conduct either inside or outside the courtroom that makes it impossible for the\ntrial to proceed without injustice to either the defendant or the prosecution. This statute\n\n\n                                              1\n\fcreates a two-step process. First, the trial court must determine if there was some\nfundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, the trial court moves to the second step and\nassesses whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. In other words, the trial\ncourt must decide if the prejudicial conduct's damaging effect can be removed or\nmitigated by an admonition, jury instruction, or other action. If not, the trial court must\ndetermine whether the degree of prejudice results in an injustice and, if so, declare a\nmistrial. On appeal, the court's abuse of discretion inquiry is divided into two parts,\nasking: (1) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when deciding if there was a\nfundamental failure in the proceeding? and (2) Did the trial court abuse its discretion\nwhen deciding whether the conduct resulted in prejudice that could not be cured or\nmitigated through jury admonition or instruction, resulting in an injustice?\n\n\n4.\n       The State committed prosecutorial error in its closing argument by asserting that\nthe defendant's medical records reflected instances where the defendant missed scheduled\nappointments, but the admitted records did not substantiate this argument. By doing so,\nthe State improperly argued facts not in evidence.\n\n\n5.\n       This court may reverse a defendant's convictions for cumulative error when the\ntotality of the circumstances demonstrate that the defendant was substantially prejudiced\nby cumulative errors and was denied a fair trial.\n\n\n6.\n       Kansas' criminal restitution scheme implicates a defendant's right to trial by jury in\nsection 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights by converting restitution orders, in\nwhich a judge determines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into civil\njudgments, thus bypassing the traditional function of juries to determine civil damages.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fTherefore, a criminal defendant will not be faced with a civil judgment for criminal\nrestitution unless it has been obtained separately through a civil cause of action.\n\n\n        Appeal from Sedgwick County District Court; KEVIN J. O'CONNOR, judge. Opinion filed October\n15, 2021. Affirmed.\n\n\n        Michelle A. Davis, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, argued the cause and was on the brief\nfor appellant.\n\n\n        Lesley A. Isherwood, assistant district attorney, argued the cause, and Marc Bennett, district\nattorney, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with her on the brief for appellee.\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\n\n\n        WALL, J.: A jury convicted Dane Owens of first-degree felony murder and\naggravated burglary in connection with the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Rowena\nIrani. Owens appeals, arguing that multiple evidentiary, trial, and prosecutorial errors\nrequire reversal of his convictions.\n\n\n        However, upon thorough examination of the record and briefing, we determine\nthat only two potential errors occurred during the proceedings. First, the prosecutor\ncommitted error by referring to a fact not in evidence during closing argument. But this\nerror primarily affected Owens' defense to first-degree, premeditated murder, and the jury\nacquitted Owens of this offense. This fact, along with other circumstances, demonstrate\nthe prosecutorial error was harmless.\n\n\n        Second, we presume, without deciding, that the State's failure to disclose the\nfindings of its pseudo-expert witness before trial constituted a fundamental failure in the\nproceedings. However, the presumed error did not inhibit Owens' defense, and the trial\ncourt implemented ameliorative measures to mitigate potential prejudice, which made it\n\n\n                                                     3\n\fpossible to proceed with the trial without injustice. Thus, the record confirms the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Owens' motion for mistrial.\n\n\n       These two errors were not interrelated in a way that amplified their prejudicial\nforce when viewed together. Whether viewed independently or in the aggregate, these\nerrors did not deprive Owens of a fair trial.\n\n\n       As for Owens' sentence, the district court's restitution order does implicate section\n5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights under the current statutory scheme. Several\nstatutory provisions serve to convert a district court's restitution order, in which a judge\ndetermines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into a civil judgment.\nThrough this process, the statutes bypass the traditional function of Kansas juries to\ndetermine civil damages. However, based on our holding in State v. Arnett, 314 Kan. ___,\n(No. 112,572, this day decided), the constitutional infirmity is cured by severing the\noffending statutory provisions. By severing these provisions, Owens will not be subject to\na civil judgment for his criminal restitution order, unless it is obtained separately through\na civil cause of action. Accordingly, the district court's restitution order satisfies\nconstitutional requirements.\n\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm Owens' convictions and restitution order.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On October 3, 2016, Owens entered the home of his ex-girlfriend Rowena and\nfired a single bullet, killing Rowena. Police arrested Owens the same day and charged\nhim with premeditated first-degree murder\u2014or felony murder in the alternative\u2014as well\nas aggravated burglary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fPretrial Evidentiary Issues\n\n\n      Before trial, the State moved to determine the admissibility of hearsay statements\nby Rowena. The State sought to introduce testimony from Rowena's brother, Rooshad\nIrani, about statements Rowena had made to him\u2014both in person and via text message\u2014\nconcerning her relationship and breakup with Owens.\n\n\n      Specifically, the State sought to admit Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him\nthat Owens said he had \"dug a hole\" for an ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him. The\nState argued this evidence was relevant in establishing Rowena's state of mind at the time\nof the shooting. Owens opposed the admission of this \"dug a hole\" testimony on several\ngrounds. The district judge found the statements admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d), the contemporaneous statement hearsay exception, because they went to\nRowena's state of mind and the fact that Owens would not have been welcome in her\nhome. The district judge recommended a limiting instruction.\n\n\n      The State also sought to admit the following text messages between Rowena and\nRooshad:\n\n\n        Sender            Message Content\n        Rooshad           \"You and dane working a few things out?\"\n                          \"His fb popped up as complicated relationship.\"\n\n\n        Rowena            \"lord\"\n                          \"he called yesterday saying he wanted to work it out and to\n                          give him a chance all that i told him to give me some time to\n                          think\"\n                          \"mom texted me saying she had a strong feeling he was going\n                          to physically abuse me if i went back\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fSender     Message Content\nRooshad    \"Ok? Bas? That's it?\"\n\n\nRowena     \"mhm\"\n\n\nRooshad    \"Kk\"\n           \"Was it a decent convo or was he being an ass\"\n\n\nRowena     \"it was alright i guess he just kept trying to justify everything\"\n           \"saying i need to trust him and let things flow and that he's not\n           telling me to give anything up\"\n           \"my thing like why go back and then have the same feelings in\n           a month\"\n\n\nRooshad    \"Yup\"\n           \"Don't do it\"\n\n\nRowena     \"i have therapy tomorrow so i'm kinda just waiting to talk to\n           him about it\"\n\n\nRooshad:   \"Just leave it alone and when he asks tell him you thought\n           long and hard and decided it's best for you 2 to go your\n           separate ways\"\n           \"Do I need to intervene?\"\nRowena     \"no\"\n           \"not yet anyway\"\n\n\nRooshad    \"K\"\n\n\nRowena     \"what's the worse that'll happen hell take a rifle and shoot me\n           [emoji smiling with bead of sweat on forehead]\"\n\n\nRooshad    \"Shut up\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\f         Sender           Message Content\n\n\n         Rowena           [three emojis smiling with beads of sweat on foreheads]\n\n\n         Rooshad          [sends a screenshot of texts Owens sent him asking about\n                          Rowena]\n\n\n         Rowena           \"story of my life\"\n\n\n         Rooshad          \"Yup\"\n\n\n         Rowena           \"getting on my fuckin nerves\"\n\n\n         Rooshad          \"Yup\"\n\n\n         Rowena           [emoji smiling with bead of sweat on forehead; gun emoji\n                          pointed at other emoji]\n\n\n       The State argued these texts were relevant to Rowena's state of mind. Owens\nargued they were not probative of the mindset the State was attempting to establish\nbecause the emojis suggested Rowena truly did not think Owens would shoot her and,\ninstead, she was just annoyed with him. Further, Owens argued \"under the facts of this\ncase, where [he was] accused of intentionally shooting her in the head, that those are\ncertainly more prejudicial than probative.\" The district judge ruled that the texts were\nadmissible.\n\n\nProsecutor's Opening Statement\n\n\n       The case proceeded to a jury trial. In its opening statement, the State informed the\njury that Detective Robert Chisholm had tried on Owens' sling (which Owens wore\nfollowing shoulder surgery on September 29, 2016) and used a gun to reconstruct or test\n\n\n                                               7\n\fOwens' description of how he wielded the gun inside the sling at the time of the shooting.\nBased on this reconstruction, the State said Detective Chisholm would testify that Owens'\naccount of the shooting was not feasible.\n\n\n       After opening statements, Owens moved for a mistrial, arguing the State\ncommitted discovery violations by failing to disclose Detective Chisholm's reconstruction\nanalysis the prosecution had described in opening remarks. The State argued there was no\ndiscovery violation; the gun and the sling would both come in as evidence, and the\ndetective could do this reenactment in front of the jury. The State further argued the jury\nitself could do the same with the gun and sling once it deliberated in the jury room. The\ndistrict court denied the request for mistrial.\n\n\nTrial Evidence\n\n\n       During the trial, Detective Chisholm testified about his interrogation of Owens the\nday of the shooting. According to Chisolm, Owens said he drove his truck to Rowena's\nneighborhood, parked, and walked to her home. He opted not to park in the Irani family's\ndriveway because he did not want them to call the police. Once there, he saw one of the\nfamily's dogs in the front yard. He let the dog inside and followed it into the home. After\nentering the home, Owens said Rowena \"came around the corner, he was startled, she\nwas startled, and the gun just went off.\" Owens then admitted he pulled the trigger. When\nDetective Chisholm asked why, Owens \"kind of shrug[ged] his shoulders\" and said \"I\nmean\u2014I mean, pretty much accepted the fact that we were done.\" Owens claimed he\n\"wasn't trying to hurt anyone,\" and while admittedly angry, he had typically been able to\ncontrol his emotions. But when asked about the breakup with Rowena, Owens said he\nwas \"'blindsided'\" by it and was tired of being \"'fucked over.'\" He said he took the gun to\nRowena's house \"so she would take him seriously.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       Detective Chisholm said Owens informed law enforcement that he threw his\nhandgun, magazine, and Rowena's cell phone in ponds near his parents' house. Police\nwere able to fish out the gun, a .45 caliber Smith and Wesson. Detective Chisholm\ntestified the gun had a 7-pound trigger pull and a trigger safety preventing the weapon\nfrom firing unless a finger was on the lower part of the trigger. Owens told Detective\nChisholm that he always carried the handgun around, but it was usually in a backpack.\nOwens said he had the gun inside the sling he was wearing on his right arm when he\nentered Rowena's home. He also informed Detective Chisholm that he is right-handed but\nshoots left-handed.\n\n\n       Before trial, Detective Chisholm decided to see if it was feasible to hold the gun\ninside the sling; he tried on the sling and held a gun inside it in the way Owens described.\nDetective Chisholm went through this same reconstruction while on the stand. Through\nthis process, Detective Chisholm determined the gun's slide would have been obstructed\nby the sling. He reasoned that, if the slide was obstructed by the sling, the shell casing\nwould not have ended up where it was ultimately found in the Iranis' home. Further,\nOwens told Detective Chisholm that as he left the Iranis' home, he had a live bullet in the\ngun's chamber. To Detective Chisholm, this suggested the gun's slide likely was not\nobstructed at the time of the shooting. Detective Chisholm also observed no burns,\nabrasions, or other marks on the sling indicating that a gun had been fired inside it.\n\n\n       During Detective Chisholm's testimony, the State also admitted into evidence the\nvideo of Owens' interrogation by police. On this video, Owens provides detectives with\nhis account of the shooting and demonstrates how he wielded the gun in his sling. Owens\nalso admitted during the interview that he sometimes told lies for attention, like when he\nclaimed that he \"dug a hole'\" for a previous ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him. The\ndistrict judge overruled Owens' objections to these \"dug a hole\" comments.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       On cross-examination, Detective Chisholm acknowledged that Owens reported\ndealing with shoulder and back injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\ndepression, and traumatic brain injury. Owens said he had been prescribed medication for\nsome of his mental health issues and was seeking treatment from the Veterans\nAdministration in Wichita and a therapist in Manhattan.\n\n\n       Rooshad testified for the State. He said Rowena told him she broke up with Owens\non September 23, 2016. He testified that Owens texted him on September 27 and 28\nabout Rowena. Then, on Friday September 30, Rooshad texted Owens, \"'You and my\nsister are done. Stop bothering her via text, Facebook, and phone calls or she will file\nharassment charges. It is over. Move on. Thank you.'\"\n\n\n       Rooshad also said that on September 23, 2016, Rowena told him that she spoke\nwith Owens and that Owens said he wanted to get married and start a family soon, which\n\"freaked\" Rowena out. Rooshad testified that according to Rowena, Owens then said that\n\"well, if that freaks you out, then you should know what I have done when I was at war. I\nhave shot and killed men, women, and children.\" Then, Owens \"made a comment of\nhaving a previous girlfriend in his life who had broken up with him a number of years\nprior, and that he had dug a hole for her with a shovel in his truck.\" Rooshad said\nRowena took these statements \"seriously.\"\n\n\n       The State also admitted a recorded phone call with Owens' mother from October 3,\n2016. The State was supposed to have redacted from the call certain law enforcement\nphone numbers, a hold time, and Owens' mother's request for an attorney when asked if\nshe would consent to a search of her home. But the copy that was played for the jury was\nunredacted. In response, Owens renewed his motion for a mistrial. The State opposed the\nmotion, arguing that \"frankly, putting on the fact that a parent doesn't want to have\nofficers search their home, car, or whatever, without a lawyer, without talking to\nsomebody first . . . it certainly does not prejudice the defendant.\" The district judge\n\n\n                                             10\n\ffound the material that was supposed to be redacted was not prejudicial to Owens and\ndenied the motion. The district judge offered to give a limiting instruction, but Owens\ndeclined.\n\n\n       The defense put on several witnesses of their own. Sergeant First Class Steve\nFrye\u2014Owens' former Army squad leader\u2014testified that at 19 years old, Owens saw\nactive combat in Afghanistan and encountered multiple IEDs. On cross, he said Owens\nwas highly trained with firearms and was instructed to always treat them as loaded and\nnever point them at something you do not intend to kill. SFC Frye also testified that\nOwens was a left-handed shooter.\n\n\n       Owens' orthopedic surgeon testified about the September 29, 2016 outpatient\nsurgery performed on Owens' right shoulder. The surgeon testified the surgery did not\naffect the function in Owens' right hand, or his left hand for that matter. The defense also\nadmitted two sets of Owens' medical records: one from the Veterans Administration, and\nthe other from Lafene Health Center in Manhattan.\n\n\n       Finally, Owens' mother testified that Owens' demeanor changed when he returned\nfrom Afghanistan. He would be startled if people touched him and did not like to ride in\nthe front seat of vehicles. While in vehicles, he was constantly observing the road, as if\nlooking for IEDs. Owens was prescribed medication to deal with these issues; the\nmedication helped, but when Owens was off the medication, he was \"jumpy,\" \"agitated,\"\nand \"seemed to be paranoid.\"\n\n\nJury Instructions, Closing Argument, and Verdict\n\n\n       During the jury instruction conference, the district judge proposed the following\naggravated burglary instruction:\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f          \"The defendant is charged with aggravated burglary. The defendant pleads not\nguilty.\n\n\n          \"To establish this charge, each of the following claims must be proved:\n\n\n          1. The defendant entered a dwelling.\n          2. The defendant did so without authority.\n          3. The defendant did so with the intent to commit aggravated assault therein.\n          4. At the time there was a human being in the dwelling.\n          5. This act occurred on or about the 3rd day of October, 2016, in Sedgwick\n          County, Kansas.\n\n\n          \"The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime intentionally. A\ndefendant acts intentionally when it is the defendant's desire or conscious objective to do\nthe act complained about by the State.\n\n\n                  \"The elements of aggravated assault are as follows:\n\n\n                  1. The defendant knowingly placed Rowena Irani in reasonable\n          apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\n                  2. The defendant did so with a deadly weapon.\n                  3.

An object\n          can be a deadly weapon if the user intended to convince a person that it is a\n          deadly weapon and that person reasonably believed it to be a deadly weapon.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fOwens did not object to this instruction.\n\n\n       The district judge also included a limiting instruction addressing the \"dug a hole\"\ncomment.\n\n\n                      \"Evidence has been admitted tending to suggest that the defendant\n              claimed to have considered an act of violence against a prior girlfriend. No\n              evidence has been admitted to establish that these acts actually occurred.\n\n\n                      \"Evidence that such a statement was allegedly made by the defendant to\n              Rowena Irani may be considered solely for the purpose of establishing the nature\n              of Ms. Irani's relationship with defendant and her state of mind in late September\n              2016 to October 3, 2016. It is not to be considered by you for any other purpose.\"\n\n\n       During Owens' closing, he did not deny shooting Rowena but argued that the\nshooting was \"a terrible accident\" and asked for a voluntary manslaughter conviction. He\npointed to his post-combat mental health issues to support his argument that the shooting\nwas unintentional because he was jumpy and paranoid.\n\n\n       During closing rebuttal, the State argued for an intentional first-degree murder\nconviction. The prosecutor addressed Owens' argument that his PTSD, traumatic brain\ninjury, and mental health issues contributed to the shooting. The prosecutor argued that\nthe medical records demonstrated Owens had not consistently sought treatment and had\nmissed scheduled appointments. The prosecutor also encouraged the jury to consider all\nthe evidence of premeditation and challenged Owens' account of the shooting.\n\n\n       The jury convicted Owens of first-degree felony murder and aggravated burglary.\nOwens was acquitted of first-degree premeditated murder. The district judge sentenced\nOwens to a hard 25 life sentence plus 43 months and ordered Owens to pay $7,470.64 in\nrestitution. Owens appealed his convictions and restitution order.\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                               ANALYSIS\n\n\nThe District Judge Did Not Abuse His Discretion in Admitting Challenged Evidence\n\n      Owens first challenges the district judge's admission of two sets of statements. The\nfirst statements are Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him about Owens' comments\nabout \"digging a hole\" for an ex-girlfriend. The second statements include a text\nexchange between Rowena and Rooshad where Rowena said, \"[M]om texted me saying\nshe had a strong feeling he was going to physically abuse me if I went back,\" and texts\nfrom the same chain between Rowena and Rooshad involving the emojis and the\ncomment \"what's the worse that'll happen hell take a rifle and shoot me.\" Owens claims\nboth sets of statements constituted inadmissible hearsay and were unduly prejudicial.\n\n\n      Standard of Review\n\n\n      \"'This court reviews a trial court's determination that hearsay is admissible under a\n      statutory exception . . . for an abuse of discretion.' State v. Summers, 293 Kan. 819, 827,\n      272 P.3d 1 (2012).

State v. Satchell, 311 Kan.\n633, 640-41, 466 P.3d 459 (2020); State v. Huddleston, 298 Kan. 941, 962, 318 P.3d 140\n(2014).\n\n\n       The \"Dug a Hole\" Comments\n\n\n       The State sought to admit Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him that Owens\nsaid he \"dug a hole\" for a previous ex-girlfriend. The State offered this testimony to\nestablish Rowena's state of mind and the fact that she would not have willingly let Owens\ninto her home\u2014which supported the \"entering a dwelling without authority\" element of\naggravated burglary. Owens objected to the admission of this testimony, claiming it did\nnot fit within the statutory hearsay exception, particularly when Rooshad could be\nmotivated by animosity to distort the statements. Owens also argued the evidence should\nbe excluded because it was not relevant and was more prejudicial than probative.\n\n\n       The district judge found the testimony admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d) because it went to Rowena's state of mind and the fact that Owens would not have\nbeen welcome in her home. The district judge ruled:\n\n\n               \"So I do think\u2014and I understand that the defense doesn't want to be defending\n       against another alleged incident that may or may not have occurred. And I also\n       understand and appreciate why the State wants to introduce this. It goes to her state of\n       mind. It also goes to why she would have said, 'I don't want to have anything to do with\n       you anymore.'\n\n\n               \"And it also goes to the fact that he would not have had permission to go into her\n       residence, which may be an issue, because oftentimes, a boyfriend or a girlfriend would\n       have permission to come into a residence of a parent or a family member. So under the\n       analysis, under 60-460(d), I'm going to find that the statement is admissible.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\f       Rooshad's testimony about Owens' \"dug a hole\" comment may qualify as double\nhearsay. Therefore, each layer must be analyzed to determine its admissibility. See\nK.S.A. 60-463 (\"A statement within the scope of an exception to K.S.A. 60-460 shall not\nbe inadmissible on the ground that it includes a statement made by another declarant and\nis offered to prove the truth of the included statement if such included statement itself\nmeets the requirements of an exception.\").\n\n\n       The first layer is Owens' declaration to Rowena that he \"dug a hole\" for an ex-\ngirlfriend. The State never offered this statement for the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that\nis, to argue that Owens did in fact dig a grave for an ex-girlfriend. Indeed, the State\nwillingly agreed to an instruction that \"[n]o evidence has been admitted to establish that\nthese acts actually occurred.\" Thus, this first layer is not hearsay. See K.S.A. 2020 Supp.\n60-460 (hearsay evidence is \"[e]vidence of a statement which is made other than by a\nwitness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the matter stated\").\n\n\n       The second layer\u2014Rowena's declaration conveying Owens' \"dug a hole\" comment\nto her brother\u2014is, however, hearsay because it was offered by the State to establish that\nOwens did indeed tell Rowena he dug a hole for his ex-girlfriend. The district judge\nfound the evidence admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d), which creates an\nexception to the general rule excluding hearsay for certain contemporaneous statements,\nincluding:\n\n\n       \"A statement which the judge finds was made: (1) While the declarant was perceiving\n       the event or condition which the statement narrates, describes or explains; (2) while the\n       declarant was under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception; or\n       (3) if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, by the declarant at a time when the matter\n       had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the declarant's recollection was\n       clear and was made in good faith prior to the commencement of the action and with no\n       incentive to falsify or to distort.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    16\n\f       On appeal, Owens argues this conversation was inadmissible hearsay because the\nState did not establish that the statement was \"(1) contemporaneous, made by Rowena\nwhen the matter had been recently perceived and while her recollection was clear, and\n(2) made in good faith with no incentive to falsify or to distort.\" Further, Owens argues\nthat \"[a]ny probative value was outweighed by unduly prejudicial effect.\"\n\n\n       Ultimately, Owens fails to establish that the district judge abused his discretion by\nadmitting the \"dug a hole\" evidence under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d) and finding that\nthe probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by the risk of\nunfair prejudice under K.S.A. 60-445.\n\n\n       The district judge's admission of the testimony under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d) did not constitute a mistake of law or fact; nor was it arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable. Lemmie, 311 Kan. at 449-50. As noted, K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3)\nprovides for admission of testimony where the statement is made by a declarant: (1) who\nis unavailable as a witness; (2) at a time when the matter had been recently perceived and\nthe declarant's recollection clear; and (3) with no incentive to falsify or distort.\n\n\n       The record establishes that the challenged evidence satisfies all three statutory\nrequirements for admission. First, Rowena was unavailable because she had been\nmurdered. See State v. Robinson, 293 Kan. 1002, 1025, 270 P.3d 1183 (2012)\n(concluding that murder victim \"clearly was unavailable as a witness\").\n\n\n       The record also supports the district judge's finding that the statements were\ncontemporaneous. The State's evidence indicated that Rowena told Rooshad about\nOwens' \"dug a hole\" comments about one week after Owens made them to her. No\nevidence suggests Rowena's recollection was unclear after having perceived Owens'\nstatements several days prior. In fact, the testimony established that Rowena took Owens'\nstatements seriously, and it is reasonable to infer from this evidence that the statements\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmade a lasting impression upon her. The district judge did not abuse his discretion by\nconcluding that Rowena recounted this conversation to Rooshad \"at a time when the\nmatter had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the declarant's recollection\nwas clear.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3); see State v. Evans, 313 Kan. 972, 986-87,\n492 P.3d 418 (2021) (statements made in the year leading up to murder were \"close\nenough in time to be considered contemporaneous.\").\n\n\n       Finally, Owens speculates that Rowena might have had incentive to distort the\nstatements to justify to her brother the decision to end the relationship with Owens.\nHowever, Rooshad's testimony reasonably inferred that Rowena's account was genuine\nand she took Owens' statements seriously. No evidence suggests Rowena made these\nstatements in bad faith or with an incentive to falsify or distort them. See Robinson, 293\nKan. at 1026 (concluding district court did not abuse discretion where evidence did not\nsupport declarant's assertion that declarant made statements in bad faith). We find no\nerror in the admission of this evidence under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3).\n\n\n       With respect to the probative value and undue prejudice analysis, K.S.A. 60-445,\nprovides:\n\n\n               \"Except as in this article otherwise provided, the judge may in his or her\n       discretion exclude evidence if he or she finds that its probative value is substantially\n       outweighed by the risk that its admission will unfairly and harmfully surprise a party who\n       has not had reasonable opportunity to anticipate that such evidence would be offered.\"\n\n\n\"While [K.S.A. 60-445] talks only of the risk of unfair surprise, it has long been applied\nmuch more broadly\u2014excluding evidence if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.\" Satchell, 311 Kan. at 640. In reviewing this\nissue, we remain mindful that Kansas law favors the admission of relevant evidence, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n\fthe exclusion of relevant evidence under K.S.A. 60-445 is an extraordinary remedy that\nshould be used sparingly. State v. Ross, 310 Kan. 216, 224, 445 P.3d 726 (2019).\n\n\n       Here, the district judge found the testimony was probative because it tended to\nestablish Rowena's state of mind and that she would not have allowed Owens into her\nhome. In turn, such evidence was probative of the third element of aggravated burglary,\nwhether defendant entered an occupied dwelling without permission. See K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 21-5807(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A). Owens argues that Rooshad's \"dug a hole\" testimony\nwas more prejudicial than probative because it suggested to the jury that Owens had a\nhistory of violence towards partners, and it had little probative value because Rowena's\nstate of mind was not a material fact in dispute.\n\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the district judge's conclusion that the probative\nvalue of this testimony was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the risk of unfair prejudice.\nFirst, the district judge correctly observed that Rowena's account of Owens' statements\ntended to support the conclusion that Rowena would not have allowed Owens into her\nhome, a fact relevant to an essential element of the aggravated burglary count. The State\nhad the burden to prove this essential element at trial, even if Owens did not affirmatively\ncontrovert the element or Rowena's state of mind. The testimony was also probative of\nthe nature of the relationship between Rowena and Owens during the days leading up to\nher death, explaining possible motive for Owens' conduct and behavior. See Evans, 313\nKan. at 989 (evidence providing background context of the parties' relationship was\nprobative of defendant's motive that supplied \"the jury with some degree of explanation,\nresponding to a juror's natural tendency to wonder why a defendant behaved in the\nmanner described by the State\").\n\n\n       Additionally, the admission of this testimony was not unduly prejudicial. Owens'\n\"dug a hole\" story had already been presented to the jury through Owens' interrogation\nvideo and Detective Chisholm's testimony, and Owens does not challenge the admission\n\n\n                                             19\n\fof this evidence on appeal. So the only new information that came from Rooshad's\ntestimony was that Owens had told Rowena the same story.\n\n\n         The district judge also gave a cautionary jury instruction stating that \"no evidence\n[had] been admitted to establish\" that Owens actually dug a hole for his ex-girlfriend. The\ninstruction made clear that \"[e]vidence that such a statement was allegedly made\" could\n\"be considered solely for the purpose of establishing the nature of Ms. Irani's relationship\nwith defendant and her state of mind in late September 2016 to October 3, 2016.\" Jurors\nwere directed not to consider this evidence \"for any other purpose.\" See State v. Dean,\n310 Kan. 848, 862-63, 450 P.3d 819 (2019) (prejudicial effect of defendant's affiliation\nwith gangs may be cured by a limiting instruction); see also State v. Navarro, 272 Kan.\n573, 582, 35 P.3d 802 (2001) (\"The general rule is that an admonition to the jury\nnormally cures the prejudice from an improper admission of evidence.\").\n\n\n         Under these facts, the district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that\nthe evidence was admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d) or by finding the\ntestimony did not cause unfair prejudice that would \"substantially outweigh\" its probative\nvalue.\n\n\n         Text Messages Between Rowena and Rooshad\n\n\n         On appeal, Owens challenges the admission of the following text messages:\n\n\n               Rowena to Rooshad: \"mom texted me saying she had a strong feeling he was\n                                      going to physically abuse me if i went back\"\n                Rowena to Rooshad: \"what's the worse that'll happen hell take a rifle and shoot\n                                      me [emoji smiling with bead of sweat on forehead]\"\n                Rooshad to Rowena: \"Shut up\"\n                Rowena to Rooshad: [three emojis smiling with beads of sweat on foreheads]\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\f              Rowena to Rooshad: in response to Rooshad's screenshot of Owens' texts to\n                                      Rooshad:\n                                      \"getting on my fuckin nerves\"; [emoji smiling with sweat\n                                      on forehead; gun emoji pointed at other emoji].\"\n\n\n      Before trial, the State argued these messages again went to Rowena's state of mind\nand that she would not have willingly let Owens into her home. The defense argued that\nthe messages showed Rowena was joking and considered the idea that Owens posed a\nthreat preposterous. Also before trial, Owens opposed admission of this text message\nchain on two grounds. His counsel stated:\n\n\n              \"So I have an objection to State's 121 [the pretrial exhibit containing these text\n      messages], twofold: One, the reference to: 'What's he going to do, take a rifle and shoot\n      me?' If it goes to her state of mind, then her state of mind is, 'What's the worst he could\n      do? It's not going to happen.' And then she laughs about it with three laughing emojis to\n      the point where the emoji is crying.\n\n\n              \"And then the following page, it talks about a story of her life being that he's\n      wanting to get back together with her, and that [Owens] is getting on her fucking nerves,\n      and so she wants to shoot herself in the head. I would argue under the facts of this case,\n      where my client is accused of intentionally shooting her in the head, that those are\n      certainly more prejudicial than probative.\"\n\n\n      At trial, Owens did not make any new arguments objecting to the admission of\nthese texts, but instead \"renew[ed] [his] previous hearsay objections.\" Like Rooshad's\ntestimony, the district judge ruled that the texts were admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp.\n60-460(d). On appeal, Owens argues that these texts \"had limited probative value\" and\nwere \"cumulative and unnecessary and very prejudicial.\"\n\n\n      To begin with, Owens' trial objection to the \"strong feeling he was going to\nphysically abuse me\" text message was only to voice a difference of opinion on how the\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fevidence should be interpreted. Owens did not lodge specific objection to the\nadmissibility of this text message at trial. By challenging the \"strong feeling\" text as\nunduly prejudicial on appeal, Owens' argument is akin to objecting on one ground below\nand arguing a different one on appeal. We have consistently held that such arguments are\nnot preserved properly for appeal. See State v. Dukes, 290 Kan. 485, 488, 231 P.3d 558\n(2010) (\"Recently, we stated that 'the trial court must be provided the specific objection\nso it may consider as fully as possible whether the evidence should be admitted and\ntherefore reduce the chances of reversible error.' Specifically, in Richmond we refused to\nallow the defendant to object on one ground at trial and then argue another on appeal.\n[Citation omitted.]\"). Because Owens did not specifically object to this text message\ncommunication at trial, the district court was never given the opportunity to fully\nconsider its admissibility. We will not consider Owens' unpreserved arguments about the\n\"strong feeling\" text. State v. Gaona, 293 Kan. 930, 954, 270 P.3d 1165 (2012) (\"If a\nparty fails to make a specific contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence or\ntestimony at trial, objection to that evidence or testimony is not preserved for appeal.\").\n\n\n       Second, the hearsay objection that Owens did preserve is unfounded. The analysis\nharkens us back to the definition of hearsay: \"Evidence of a statement which is made\nother than by a witness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the\nmatter stated.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460. Most of the remaining messages in the\nchallenged texts were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted because they are not\ndeclarations and do not assert any matter. The \"what's the worse that'll happen\"\nstatement, though ominous, was not offered by the State to show that this was indeed the\nworst thing that could happen, or that Rowena believed it was the worst thing that could\nhappen. Instead, it was offered as insight to Rowena's state of mind. Furthermore, this\nwas a rhetorical question that did not attempt to establish the truth of any asserted matter.\n\n\n       Similarly, Owens fails to make a case on appeal that the emojis\u2014specifically the\nsmiling one with the bead of sweat and the gun directed at it\u2014contain or express the truth\n\n\n                                             22\n\fof a matter being asserted. Thus, the emojis cannot be characterized as hearsay\nstatements.\n\n\n       The only message from this group of texts that can be properly characterized as\nbeing offered for the truth of the matter asserted was Rowena's statement \"getting on my\nfuckin nerves,\" which is an assertion that Owens was bothering her. Nevertheless, the\ndistrict judge found that these messages, to the extent they were hearsay, were admissible\nunder K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d), finding: \"She is perceiving the matter about which\nthe statements are made while her recollection is clear.\"\n\n\n       We hold the district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that the\nportions of these texts that were hearsay, if any, were admissible under K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 60-460(d)(3), the contemporaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule. This\ndeclaration (\"getting on my fuckin nerves\") explains Rowena's state of mind moments\nafter Rooshad forwarded her a screenshot of Owens' texts. In turn, this state of mind\nevidence provided insight into the nature of her relationship with Owens leading up to the\nshooting. And Owens has not established on appeal that Rowena had incentive to falsify\nor distort this reaction. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\ntext messages under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3).\n\n\n       With respect to the K.S.A. 60-445 probative value and prejudice concerns, we find\nno abuse of discretion in the district judge's conclusion that the probative value of the\ntexts was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the threat of unfair prejudice. As with\nRooshad's testimony above, the text messages were probative because a juror could\nreasonably infer from them that Rowena would not have given Owens permission to\nenter her family's home. The evidence was also probative of Owens' motive. In turn,\nOwens fails to explain why the emoji text messages were unfairly prejudicial in his brief\non appeal. This court cannot independently develop an argument for prejudice on Owens'\nbehalf. See State v. Lowery, 308 Kan. 1183, 1231, 427 P.3d 865 (2018) (\"'A point raised\n\n\n                                              23\n\fincidentally in a brief and not argued therein is deemed abandoned.'\"). Accordingly, we\nconclude the district judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying the Mistrial Motions\n\n\n       Owens next argues the district judge committed reversible error by twice denying\nhis requests for a mistrial. Owens first moved for a mistrial on the first day of trial. He\nargued the State surprised him during opening argument when it first disclosed that\nDetective Chisholm had performed a reconstruction using Owens' sling and gun and\nclaimed this reconstruction would show Owens' account of the shooting was implausible.\n\n\n       Owens renewed his motion later in the trial when the State failed to redact the\nrecording of a phone call between a detective and Owens' mother, wherein Owens'\nmother said she wanted to consult with an attorney before consenting to law\nenforcement's search of her house. The district judge denied both requests. We address\neach request in turn.\n\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n\n       This court explained the procedure and applicable standard of review for mistrial\nrequests in State v. Waller, 299 Kan. 707, 725-26, 328 P.3d 1111 (2014):\n\n\n               \"Under K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c), a trial court may declare a mistrial if there was\n       prejudicial conduct either inside or outside the courtroom that makes it impossible for the\n       trial to proceed without injustice to either the defendant or the prosecution. This statute\n       creates a two-step process. First, the trial court must determine if there was some\n       fundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, the trial court moves to the second step and\n       assesses whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. In other words, the trial\n       court must decide if the prejudicial conduct's damaging effect can be removed or\n       mitigated by an admonition, jury instruction, or other action. If not, the trial court must\n\n\n\n                                                    24\n\f       determine whether the degree of prejudice results in an injustice and, if so, declare a\n       mistrial. State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, 550, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied [565 U.S.\n       1221] (2012); see State v. Race, 293 Kan. 69, 80, 259 P.3d 707 (2011).\n\n\n               \"In Ward, our court articulated this standard by dividing the appellate court's\n       abuse of discretion inquiry into two parts, asking: (1) Did the trial court abuse its\n       discretion when deciding if there was a fundamental failure in the proceeding? and (2)\n       Did the trial court abuse its discretion when deciding whether the conduct resulted in\n       prejudice that could not be cured or mitigated through jury admonition or instruction,\n       resulting in an injustice? 292 Kan. at 551.\"\n\n\n       Generally, where, as here, a defendant alleges the district court erred by not\ngranting a mistrial, the defendant bears the burden of proving that his or her substantial\nrights to a fair trial were prejudiced. State v. Sappington, 285 Kan. 158, 173, 169 P.3d\n1096 (2007).\n\n\n       The First Mistrial Motion\n\n\n       The portion of the opening statement at issue in Owens' first motion for mistrial is\nas follows:\n\n\n       \"So Detective Chisholm will tell you a couple of things about the statement that Mr.\n       Owens gives to him. His explanation for everything is that his gun was in the sling, and it\n       just went off. I don't know what happened. It just went off.\n\n\n               \"What you'll also hear him tell Detective Chisholm is that he shoots with his left\n       hand; the one that didn't have the surgery. But on this occasion, the gun was in his right\n       hand, in the sling somehow.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      25\n\f           \"So what the police did is when Dane was arrested, they took that sling and put it\ninto evidence. They were able to find the gun. They never found the magazine. They\nnever found the live round. They never found Rowena's phone. But they did find the\nfirearm.\n\n\n           \"Detective Chisholm has been with the homicide unit probably 25 years. He\nknows more about guns than most people will, in his experience personally and through\nlaw enforcement. But he also sent the gun to the Forensic Science Center for the firearms\nexaminer to look at it and compare it with the bullet that they had found to see what\ninformation he could give. And the firearms examiner will tell you that the trigger pull\ntakes seven pounds. . . .\n\n\n           \"But what Detective Chisholm did is when he's in the interview with Mr.\nOwens\u2014and you'll see it\u2014but there's a part where he tries to explain how this gun was in\nthe sling. So Detective Chisholm, on his own time and when he has the gun and has the\nsling, puts it on him and tries to see if this is feasible. And what he found out is that gun\nwon't fit. And if the gun won't fit, the mechanism to discharge the cartridge wouldn't\nwork right. And you will hear and you will see this as well.\"\n\n\nOwens requested a mistrial, stating:\n\n\n           \"During the course of the State's opening statement, we were told for the first\ntime that apparently the case agent conducted some experiment on a piece of evidence\nand then reached certain conclusions that the story couldn't have been the way my client\nsaid it because of the way the casing was ejected from the firearm. There has been no\nreport provided on any kind of scientific or experimental testing by the State. I certainly\nhaven't been given so much as an email about it, so I move for mistrial at this time.\nThey've already told the jury about some piece of evidence that I have never been told\nabout. Apparently, it's some kind of test done by the case agent that he hasn't written a\nreport on. I'd be shocked if there wasn't an email from somewhere saying, 'Hey, fellows,\nthis is what I did and this is what happened.' So I believe it's a blatant discovery violation\nand I move for mistrial.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       The State countered that Detective Chisholm had just conducted this\nreconstruction the Friday before trial began (on the following Tuesday) and it would\nquestion Detective Chisholm about this issue on the stand. Further, the State highlighted\nthat both the gun and the sling were going to be admitted as evidence, and Kansas law\npermitted the jury to take both the gun and the sling back into the jury room where jurors\ncould conduct the same experiment of their own accord, if they wished.\n\n\n       The district judge denied the request for a mistrial, reasoning:\n\n\n       \"I don't see it as a scientific experiment. I don't see it as expert testimony; and the remedy\n       for finding this out during opening statement which, again, I would state they could have\n       just had Detective Chisholm testify and done it right there and then, and it could have\n       been something that came to them during the direct examination of Detective Chisholm,\n       with the items here and have him try it.\n\n\n                \"But also, then, if the defense wants an opportunity before Detective Chisholm\n       testifies to see what and how he did this examination of the evidence, I will allow for\n       that.\"\n\n\nThe defense confirmed that it wanted the opportunity to see Detective Chisholm's\ndemonstration and examination before he testified.\n\n\n       On direct examination, the State highlighted Detective Chisholm's familiarity with\nand expertise in firearms but did not designate him as an expert. Over the defense's\nobjection, Detective Chisholm demonstrated his reenactment for the jury, putting on the\nsling, holding the gun, and explaining that he did not believe Owens' account of the\nshooting was true because if the gun were in the sling, the casing would not have ended\nup on the staircase where crime scene technicians ultimately found it. The defense cross-\nexamined him about his reenactment and conclusions. Detective Chisholm admitted that\nhe \"wouldn't say that [he] had any real findings\" based on the demonstration. He also\n\n\n                                                    27\n\fobserved that there were no burns on the sling, but he admitted the sling was not tested\nfor gunpowder residue.\n\n\n       On appeal, Owens argues that the \"surprise\" in the State's opening statement was\nfundamentally unfair because the defense was \"unprepared to counter the evidence that\nthe State had just proffered.\" The State counters that no fundamental unfairness occurred\nbecause the evidence the State promised \"was no different than what the jury witnessed\ndefendant demonstrating on video during his interview, and no different than what the\ndetective illustrated during his own testimony before the jury.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the State used Detective Chisholm as more or less a pseudo-expert,\noutlining his experience with firearms and expertise in their function, despite never\nformally designating him an expert. Because Detective Chisholm was never officially\ndesignated an expert, the State did not disclose to the defense his \"demonstration,\" his\nqualifications, or any of the underlying grounds or basis supporting the reliability of his\nopinions. We presume without deciding that the failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's\ndemonstration before trial was a fundamental failure in the proceeding. See Waller, 299\nKan. at 725.\n\n\n       Presuming error, we move to the second step of the analysis and determine\nwhether such a fundamental failure \"caused prejudice that could not be cured or mitigated\nthrough jury admonition or instruction or other means, resulting in an injustice.\" State v.\nCorey, 304 Kan. 721, 730, 374 P.3d 654 (2016). Owens argues that \"[f]undamental\nfairness would have allowed the defense, pretrial, to seek its own firearms 'familiar'\nwitness demonstration, taking into account Mr. Owens' unique physique.\" As the State\npoints out, Owens was \"never deprived of such an opportunity.\" His defense, dating back\nto the initial interrogation, was always that he fired the gun by accident. He could have\nhired an expert at any point to bolster this theory by showing that his accidental-shooting-\nfrom-inside-the-sling theory was feasible. See State v. White, 284 Kan. 333, 343, 161\n\n\n                                             28\n\fP.3d 208 (2007) (district court did not err in denying mistrial motion where prosecutor's\nfailure to disclose change in expert testimony did not destroy, or even change, the theory\nof defense), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in State v. McLinn,\n307 Kan. 307, 320, 409 P.3d 1 (2018).\n\n\n       Owens also argues that a mistrial was required because \"the defense was\nunprepared to rebut the new evidence and the bells could not be unrung.\" We disagree.\nThe defense was given the opportunity to meet with Detective Chisholm before he\ntestified to examine him about his demonstration. The defense thoroughly cross-\nexamined Detective Chisholm about the demonstration on the stand. Insomuch as the\ndefense was caught off-guard by the State's opening, we cannot say this resulted in\nincurable prejudice. Further, as to the prosecutor's opening remarks, the jury was\nappropriately instructed that \"[s]tatements, arguments, and remarks of counsel are\nintended to help you in understanding the evidence and in applying the law, but they are\nnot evidence. If any statements are made that are not supported by evidence, they should\nbe disregarded.\" See State v. Kleypas, 305 Kan. 224, Syl. \u00b6 16, 382 P.3d 373 (2016)\n(Generally, we presume juries follow a court's instructions, and a defendant must come\nforward with some evidence to overcome the presumption to demonstrate grounds for\nmistrial.).\n\n\n       The State's failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's reconstruction did not result in\nincurable prejudice, resulting in an injustice. We hold that the district judge did not abuse\nhis discretion by denying Owens' request for mistrial.\n\n\n       The Second Mistrial Motion\n\n\n       Owens lodged his second motion for a mistrial after the State played an\nunredacted version of a recorded phone call between police and Owens' mother. Before\nplaying the recording, the State represented to the defense and to the court that it had\n\n\n                                             29\n\fredacted the portion of the tape where Owens' mother said she wanted to consult an\nattorney in response to a detective's request to search her home. Yet, the recording that\nthe State played was not redacted. Owens moved for a mistrial because \"[w]e were told,\nspecifically, that that information would not be played in front of the jury, and it was.\"\n\n\n       The district judge denied the request, reasoning:\n\n\n               \"The evidence that was presented\u2014the issue is Ms. Owens saying that she wasn't\n       sure she wanted the police to search their house and asking if she needed a lawyer, which\n       the question really is whether it is admissible or not as it relates to Mr. Owens, who is on\n       trial. It is evidence that the parties had agreed would not come in. It did come in, and if it\n       is admissible evidence, it is not overly prejudicial to this defendant, because it does not\n       affect any rights that he, himself, exerted. He, at that time, was 27 some-odd-years old.\"\n\n\nThe district judge also offered a limiting instruction directing jurors to disregard Owens'\nmother's comment about an attorney. Owens declined the instruction, motivated by a\ndesire to \"not ring the bell again.\"\n\n\n       We again return to the two-step framework from Waller, 299 Kan. at 725-26.\nFirst, we consider whether the district judge abused his discretion by finding no\nfundamental failure in the proceeding had occurred. Owens argues the district judge \"did\nnot address the unfairness to the defense. Instead, [Owens claims] the court minimized\nthe damage, stating it was 'not shocking' that [Owens' mother] was reluctant to agree to a\nsearch of her home.\" Moreover, Owens suggests \"[a]ny implication that Mr. Owens'\nfamily had something to hide, or were protecting him, was damaging to his defense,\nwhich was based on credibility.\"\n\n\n       We hold that the district judge did not abuse his discretion by finding that the\npresentation of the unredacted tape was not a fundamental failure in the proceedings. A\njury could reasonably understand why Owens' mother may have wanted to consult with\n\n\n                                                    30\n\fan attorney before agreeing to a search of her home. The jury's knowledge that Owens'\nmother wanted an attorney's advice did not amount to a fundamental failure. See, e.g.,\nState v. Rice, 261 Kan. 567, 593, 932 P.2d 981 (1997) (The district judge did not abuse\nhis discretion by denying a motion for mistrial after a police officer testified that the\ndefendant invoked his right to counsel, where \"jury was told to draw no negative\nimplication from Rice's decision not to talk with police before talking with his attorney\nand no further mention of the incident was made.\"). And Owens fails to establish that any\nprejudicial inference would have been attributed to him, rather than his mother. Finally,\nthe district judge offered a limiting instruction here, but Owens declined it.\n\n\n       Because we find no error in the district court's conclusion that there was no\nfundamental failure in the proceedings, we need not proceed to the second step and\nconsider prejudice. Accordingly, we hold that the district judge did not commit reversible\nerror by denying Owens' motions for mistrial.\n\n\nThe Aggravated Burglary Instruction Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n\n       Owens next argues that the district judge committed reversible instructional error.\nSpecifically, he challenges the definition of \"knowingly\" that the district judge provided\nin the aggravated burglary instruction.\n\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n\n               \"This court follows a four-step progression when reviewing challenges to jury\n       instructions: First, it considers the reviewability of the issue from both jurisdiction and\n       preservation viewpoints, exercising an unlimited standard of review; next, it applies\n       unlimited review to determine whether the instruction was legally appropriate; then, it\n       determines whether there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\n       the defendant or the requesting party, that would have supported the instruction; and\n       finally, if the district court erred, this court determines whether the error was harmless,\n\n\n                                                    31\n\f       utilizing the test and degree of certainty set forth in State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, 256\n       P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied 565 U.S. 1221 (2012).\" State v. Claerhout, 310 Kan. 924,\n       935-36, 453 P.3d 855 (2019).\n\n\n       However, if a defendant fails to object to the instructional error below, the clear\nerror standard is applied to assess prejudice. Instructional error is clearly erroneous when\n\"'the reviewing court is firmly convinced that the jury would have reached a different\nverdict had the instruction error not occurred.'\" State v. Dominguez, 299 Kan. 567, 574,\n328 P.3d 1094 (2014).\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       The State argues that Owens is not entitled to relief on this front because he not\nonly assented to the district judge's proposed instruction containing the challenged\ndefinition of \"knowingly,\" but in fact invited the error by requesting the same definition\nin his proposed instructions. The invited error argument is baseless because Owens\nproposed this definition of \"knowingly\" in the context of an instruction titled \"homicide\ndefinitions,\" not as part of the instruction on the elements for aggravated burglary and\naggravated assault. Owens therefore did not invite the error he now complains of, that is,\nthe district court's definition of \"knowingly\" in the aggravated burglary instruction.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, Owens did not object to the district court's instruction at trial. Thus,\nthe clear error framework applies. State v. Boeschling, 311 Kan. 124, 131, 458 P.3d 234\n(2020) (\"[T]he clear error framework applies when a party fails to object to an instruction\nbelow but claims that instruction is error on appeal.\").\n\n\n       The State charged Owens with aggravated burglary. Under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-\n5807(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A), the elements of aggravated burglary are:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    32\n\f       1. Without authority\n       2. Entering a dwelling\n       3. While another person was inside said dwelling\n       4. With the intent to commit a felony therein.\n\n\n       The felony that the State alleged Owens intended to commit inside the home\n(under the fourth element of aggravated burglary) was aggravated assault. K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 21-5412 defines aggravated assault as \"knowingly placing another person in\nreasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm\" using a deadly weapon. Thus, the\nculpable mental state for aggravated assault is \"knowingly.\"\n\n\n       Owens argues that the district judge erred by instructing the jury, with respect to\nthe aggravated assault underlying the aggravated burglary, that \"[a] defendant acts\nknowingly when the defendant is aware of the nature of his conduct that the State\ncomplains about.\" This is PIK Crim 4th 52.010 option 1 for the definition of\n\"knowingly.\" Owens contends the district judge should have instructed the jury that a\ndefendant acts knowingly \"'when he or she was aware that his or her conduct was\nreasonably certain to cause the result.'\" This is PIK Crim 4th 52.010 option 3 for the\ndefinition of \"knowingly.\"\n\n\n       We disagree because the district court's instruction was legally appropriate. In this\ncase, any distinction between the two definitions of \"knowingly\" is one without legal\nsignificance. The definition of \"knowingly\" in the instruction as given meant that the jury\nhad to find that Owens was aware of the nature of the conduct of which the State\ncomplains. In other words, Owens had to be aware that his conduct was reasonably\ncertain to put Rowena in fear. Defendant's proposed definition of \"knowingly\" conveyed\nthe same meaning. The district court's denial of the requested instruction was not clearly\nerroneous because the instruction as given properly and fairly stated the law as applied to\nthe facts of the case. See State v. Pabst, 273 Kan. 658, 659, 44 P.3d 1230 (2002) (where\n\n\n                                             33\n\fdistrict court denies requested instruction, appellate court focuses inquiry on whether\ninstruction given properly and fairly stated the law as applied to the facts of the case).\n\n\n       Furthermore, the record was rife with evidence of Owens' \"knowledge,\" i.e., that\nOwens was aware that his conduct would place Rowena in reasonable apprehension of\nimmediate bodily harm. Based on Owens' own account of the incident during\ninterrogation, he decided to park down the street, rather than in Rowena's driveway, to\navoid detection. Owens entered Rowena's house with a gun to be \"take[n] . . . seriously.\"\nHe carried the gun in the sling, without concealing it entirely, because he wanted Rowena\nto know he had a gun. He said he was \"pissed\" at Rowena because she did not give him a\n\"legitimate explanation\" for the breakup. Based on this evidence, we are not firmly\nconvinced that the jury would have reached a different verdict under Owens' requested\ninstruction.\n\n\n       For these reasons, the district court's aggravated burglary instruction was legally\nproper, factually appropriate, and not clearly erroneous.\n\n\nThe Prosecutor Committed Harmless Error in Closing\n\n\n       Owens next argues that the State committed reversible prosecutorial error. First,\nOwens complains that the prosecutor inappropriately used the \"dug a hole\" evidence to\n\"show propensity and character through conduct\" in closing. Further, Owens complains\nthat the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence by referencing missed mental health\nappointments that were not actually supported by admitted evidence. We address each\ncomplaint in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f       Standard of Review\n\n\n                \"In considering a claim of prosecutorial error, [the court] follow[s] a two-step\n       analysis. [It] first determine[s] whether an error occurred. Second, if an error has been\n       found, [it] evaluate[s] the prejudice [the error] caused to determine whether it was\n       harmless. At the first step, error occurs if the appellate court determines the prosecutor's\n       actions or statements 'fall outside the wide latitude afforded prosecutors to conduct the\n       State's case and attempt to obtain a conviction in a manner that does not offend the\n       defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial.' A criminal defendant establishes the first\n       prong by establishing the prosecutor misstated the law or argued a fact or factual\n       inferences with no evidentiary foundation. [Citations omitted.]\" State v. Ballou, 310 Kan.\n       591, 596, 448 P.3d 479 (2019).\n\n\n       The Prosecutor's Argument Regarding the \"Dug a Hole\" Evidence\n\n\n       Owens first challenges the prosecutor's reference to the \"dug a hole\" evidence. The\nchallenged portion of the State's closing provided:\n\n\n                \"What do we have? We have a guy who his roommates and his mom knows he\n       has a .45. That gun will not be found because it's not at his house. The cops don't know\n       that it's in the lake. They'll never find it, okay. It's not in Manhattan; it's not at his folks'\n       house. He has been told over and over again to stay away from her by her own brother\n       who is a cop. She has cut him off of her social media. He's in the Wichita area the day of\n       the shooting. He is alone. His family is not with him. No one is going to give him an\n       alibi. And we've got Marvin sitting in his driveway, and we'll have pictures that the cops\n       are going to find, because they did, of him going in and going out, and a car consistent\n       with his dad's truck. If I got no statement from him, is that the kind of circumstantial case\n       you would want to look at and give some weight to? He's the ex-boyfriend. He's breaking\n       up. His last words to her the last time they spoke was this whole business about, well, the\n       last girlfriend I had\u2014and tells that whole story. It's irrelevant if that's true. It's just a\n       weird thing to say to a girl you're trying to get back in touch with. 'Well, the last\n       girlfriend I had, I dug a hole for.'\n\n\n\n\n                                                       35\n\f              \"When tragedies happen people want to try to make sense of them.\"\n\n\n      The prosecutor went on:\n\n\n      \"It is not a unique story. He dated a girl. He wanted it to go in a direction she didn't. He's\n      talking marriage after six weeks, eight weeks. When she told him right off the bat,\n      'Brother, this is going to be fun, but I'm heading out of state.' And then told it was over.\n      He doesn't leave it alone. He tells her this crazy story; tells her what happened in war.\n\n\n              \"Her own family, her brother gets involved and says, 'Back off.' She defriends\n      him. He brings his gun from Manhattan. He takes it home and gets it loaded. He gets in\n      his dad's car and he drives to the house. Whether he was driving around or sitting and\n      waiting, okay. A whole lot of time passes while he's thinking about what he's going to do.\n      He could have turned around and headed back to Andover, or Manhattan for that matter.\n      But he chose to stay. He chose to park. He chose to walk up there. And he chose to have\n      that weapon out.\"\n\n\n      Owens claims the State used the \"dug a hole\" comments impermissibly \"to show\npropensity and character through conduct,\" and to \"inflame the passions or prejudices of\njurors.\" But he does not develop these arguments beyond these bare assertions.\n\n\n      To the contrary, the prosecutor's argument illustrated how Rooshad's testimony\n(that Owens told Rowena about the \"dug a hole\" story) controverted Owens' claim that he\nwent to Rowena's home just to talk about getting back together. Based on this testimony,\nthe prosecutor reasonably argued that after Owens told Rowena the \"dug a hole\" story, it\nwas unlikely that Owens was bewildered by Rowena's decision to end the relationship\nand that he entered her home only in search of Rowena's \"legitimate\" explanation for the\nbreakup. We hold that these comments were founded on reasonable inferences from the\nadmitted evidence and within the \"wide latitude\" afforded to prosecutors in closing\nargument. See State v. Longoria, 301 Kan. 489, 524, 343 P.3d 1128 (2015).\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f        The Prosecutor's Argument Regarding the Missed Medical Appointments\n\n\n        Next, Owens argues that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence in closing\nargument by claiming Owens missed several scheduled mental health appointments and\nreferencing, as support, medical records that were not admitted into evidence. During this\nsection of closing, the State attacked Owens' argument that his PTSD, traumatic brain\ninjury, and mental health issues caused him to accidentally fire the gun. The prosecutor\nsaid:\n\n\n                \"You're going to get all these stacks of records about all the efforts he went\n        through, and the VA was letting him down. And, you know, he's got PTSD and all these\n        things, and he's just not getting the help he wants. For what it's worth, if you want to pore\n        through them, page 120 of the Levine [sic] records, this is in May of '16, so what, just\n        three or four months before the act. 'The patient did not show up for his appointment.\n        This is his fourth consecutive no show.' This is a guy who is crying for help; he sure\n        misses a lot of appointments with his docs. Again, this is a pattern. It goes back to May of\n        '15. 157, I think it is, yeah. 'Patient did not show up for his appointment.'\n\n\n                \"'Patient did not show up for his appointment,' page 158.\n\n\n                \"He no-showed for his new patient appointment, page 177. Does that mean\n        anything? Does that mean he's guilty of murder? No. But as we're trying to\u2014as the\n        defense wants to put all of this into this notion that he's been to war. He's served his\n        country honorably. He came back a different man, and he's not getting the support and\n        help he wants, and that's why he was at this dire, dark place and this accident, this terrible\n        accident happened, well, take a good, hard look at that.\"\n\n\n        The State concedes that \"the medical records in the record on appeal do not\ncontain the page numbers referenced by the prosecutor.\" But the State attempts to smooth\nover the fact that the prosecutor's statements did not match up with the records in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      37\n\fevidence by arguing that the \"fact\" that Owens did not utilize medical help available to\nhim \"was indeed in evidence.\"\n\n\n       The State's argument is unconvincing. The prosecutor plainly argued facts not in\nevidence. The prosecutor said Owens' pattern of declining help \"goes back to May of\n'15.\" None of the record cites the State referenced to support the prosecutor's closing\nargument date back to May of 2015. The only admitted records from Lafene Health\nCenter in 2015 confirm that Owens did attend scheduled appointments, and none offer\nsupport for the prosecutor's argument. And the admitted Veterans Administration records\ndo not reflect any treatment provided or offered to Owens in 2015 at all.\n\n\n       Similarly, none of the record cites submitted by the State in its appellate brief deal\nwith a no-showed \"new patient\" appointment, which the prosecutor also claimed Owens\nmissed. \"[I]t is clearly improper for a prosecutor to state facts that are not in evidence.\"\nState v. Banks, 306 Kan. 854, 862, 397 P.3d 1195 (2017) (citing State v. Ly, 277 Kan.\n386, 393, 85 P.3d 1200 [2004]). Doing so exceeds the \"wide latitude\" afforded to\nprosecutors in closing. Ballou, 310 Kan. at 596. Thus, the prosecutor committed error\nduring closing argument, and we must proceed to the second step of the analysis \"to\ndetermine whether it was harmless.\" 310 Kan. at 596.\n\n\n       \"Prosecutorial error is harmless if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt the\nerror . . . did not affect the trial's outcome in light of the entire record, i.e., when there is\nno reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict.\" State v. Love, 305 Kan.\n716, 728, 387 P.3d 820 (2017) (citing State v. Sherman, 305 Kan. 88, 109, 378 P.3d 1060\n[2016]). The State contends the prosecutor's error does not warrant reversal of Owens'\nconvictions because any error is harmless. Ultimately, we agree with the State.\n\n\n       The State charged Owens with first-degree premeditated murder or, in the\nalternative, felony murder. Owens used the medical records to bolster his defense that\n\n\n                                                38\n\fOwens did not intend to pull the trigger and shoot Rowena, therefore, suggesting the\nkilling was accidental, not intentional and premeditated. The State's closing argument\nrelied on medical records not in evidence to challenge this defense.\n\n\n       Ultimately, the jury acquitted Owens of first-degree, premeditated murder and\nconvicted him under the alternate theory of felony murder, specifically a killing in the\ncommission of aggravated burglary. Owens' defense\u2014that he did not pull the trigger\nintentionally or with premeditation\u2014was not a legally viable defense to Owens' crime of\nconviction. Whether Owens intentionally pulled the trigger or did so accidentally makes\nno legal difference for purposes of felony murder. The jury did not have to find Owens\nintended to kill Rowena or acted with premeditation to convict him of felony murder; the\njury only had to find Owens killed Rowena while committing aggravated burglary. See\nState v. Mireles, 297 Kan. 339, 366, 301 P.3d 677 (2013) (\"[T]he elements of felony\nmurder do not include a killing that is intentional or done with premeditation.\"). And, as\ndiscussed previously, there is abundant evidence to support the jury's finding that Owens\nkilled Rowena during an aggravated burglary. Therefore, the prosecutorial error was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\nNo Cumulative Error\n\n\n       Owens contends he is entitled to a new trial because of cumulative error. This\ncourt may reverse a defendant's convictions for cumulative error \"when the totality of the\ncircumstances demonstrate that the defendant was substantially prejudiced by cumulative\nerrors and was denied a fair trial.\" State v. George, 311 Kan. 693, 709, 466 P.3d 469\n(2020) (citing State v. Holt, 300 Kan. 985, 1007, 336 P.3d 312 [2014]).\n\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\f       Standard of Review\n\n\n               \"The test is whether the errors substantially prejudiced the defendant and denied\n       the defendant a fair trial under the totality of the circumstances. See State v. Tully, 293\n       Kan. 176, 205-07, 262 P.3d 314 (2011). In making the assessment of whether the\n       cumulative errors are harmless error, an appellate court examines the errors in the context\n       of the record as a whole considering how the trial judge dealt with the errors as they arose\n       (including the efficacy, or lack of efficacy, of any remedial efforts); the nature and\n       number of errors committed and their interrelationship, if any; and the strength of the\n       evidence. See State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, 578, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied 132 S.\n       Ct. 1594 (2012). 'No prejudicial error may be found upon this cumulative effect rule . . .\n       if the evidence is overwhelming against the defendant.' State v. Colston, 290 Kan. 952,\n       Syl. \u00b6 15, 235 P.3d 1234 (2010); see, e.g., Alvarez v. Boyd, 225 F.3d 820, 824-25 (7th\n       Cir. 2000) (listing various factors to be considered in cumulative error analysis), cert.\n       denied 531 U.S. 1192 (2001); United States v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir.1998)\n       (same). Because the standard under Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824,\n       17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied 386 U.S. 987 (1967), applies to the three instances of\n       prosecutorial misconduct, '''the cumulative error must be harmless beyond a reasonable\n       doubt.''' Tully, 293 Kan. at 205 (quoting United States v. Toles, 297 F.3d 959, 972 [10th\n       Cir. 2002]).\" State v. Holt, 300 Kan. 985, 1007-08, 336 P.3d 312 (2014).\n\n\n       Here, we presumed (without deciding) error in the first step of the mistrial analysis\nbased on the State's failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's demonstration before trial.\nBut we concluded that the district court did not err by concluding the trial could proceed\nwithout injustice. We also held that the State committed prosecutorial error by stating\nfacts not in evidence during its closing argument. But we concluded this error was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\n       The presumed error and harmless prosecutorial error affected separate and distinct\nsubject matter and issues. The errors were not interrelated in a way that enhanced their\nprejudicial force. In other words, the cumulative impact of the errors is no greater than\nthe sum of their individual parts.\n\n                                                    40\n\f       Moreover, the weight of the evidence against Owens was remarkably strong. The\njury heard Owens' confession to shooting Rowena, after he entered her home without\npermission to intimidate her. The State supplemented the confession with substantial\ndirect and circumstantial evidence that convincingly established the elements of felony\nmurder and aggravated burglary. Given the negligible impact of the unrelated errors,\ncoupled with the strength of the State's evidence, we hold that the cumulative effect of\nthe errors was harmless beyond reasonable doubt and did not deny Owens a fair trial. See\nTully, 293 Kan. at 205-07.\n\n\nKansas' Criminal Restitution Scheme Implicates Section 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill\nof Rights\n\n\n       Finally, Owens argues that Kansas' criminal restitution scheme is unconstitutional.\nUnder that scheme, district court judges must order criminal defendants to pay restitution.\nThis restitution includes, but is not limited to, damage or loss caused by the defendant's\ncrime, as determined by the judge. See K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-6604(b)(1); K.S.A. 2016\nSupp. 21-6607(c)(2). Once the judge orders restitution, the statutory scheme converts the\naward into a civil judgment, which may be enforced the same as any other civil\njudgment. K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-6604(b)(2); K.S.A. 60-4301.\n\n\n       Owens argues this statutory scheme violates section 5 of the Kansas Constitution\nBill of Rights, which provides: \"The right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\" He contends\nthis guarantee preserved the common-law right to have juries determine damages in civil\ntort claims. According to Owens, the statutory restitution scheme effectively allows a\njudge, rather than a jury, to determine civil damages, thus implicating section 5. He\ntherefore asks this court to vacate his restitution order.\n\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f       Preservation\n\n\n       Owens admits he did not raise this constitutional challenge before the district\ncourt. Generally, we do not consider constitutional claims for the first time on appeal.\nState v. Daniel, 307 Kan. 428, 430, 410 P.3d 877 (2018). That said, we agree with Owens\nthat his claim meets one of the discretionary exceptions to this general rule\u2014that\nconsideration of the claim is necessary to serve the ends of justice or prevent the denial of\nfundamental rights. See State v. Dukes, 290 Kan. 485, 488, 231 P.3d 558 (2010).\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       Determining a statute's constitutionality is a question of law over which we have\nunlimited review. State v. Soto, 299 Kan. 102, 121, 322 P.3d 334 (2014).\n\n\n       The outcome here is controlled by our decision in Arnett. There, we held that the\ncurrent statutory restitution scheme violates section 5 by converting restitution orders, in\nwhich a judge determines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into civil\njudgments, thereby bypassing the traditional function of juries to determine civil\ndamages. Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18. Specifically, Arnett held that K.S.A. 60-\n4301; K.S.A. 60-4302; K.S.A. 60-4303; K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-6604(b)(2); and the last\nsentence of K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 22-3424(d)(1) violate section 5. However, we also held\nthat the proper remedy for this constitutional impropriety was to sever the offending\nportions of the statutory scheme rather than vacate every judicially determined restitution\norder. Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18.\n\n\n       Owens is thus correct that the criminal restitution statutory scheme implicates\nsection 5. However, once the unconstitutional provisions of that scheme are severed,\nOwens' original restitution judgment is constitutionally firm. He will not be subject to a\ncivil judgment for his criminal restitution unless it is obtained separately through a civil\n\n\n                                             42\n\fcause of action. See Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18. Thus, we affirm the district\ncourt's restitution order.\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n       DARYL D. AHLQUIST, District Judge, assigned.1\n\n\n                                            ***\n\n\n       ROSEN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part: I agree with the majority's\nwell-reasoned decision affirming Owens' convictions. Consistent with my position in\nState v. Arnett, 314 Kan. ___ (No. 112,572, this day decided), and State v. Robison, 314\nKan. ___ (No. 120,903, this day decided), I dissent from the majority's conclusion that\nthe Kansas criminal restitution scheme does not violate the right to jury trial under\nsection 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. I would adopt the reasoning set forth\nin Judge Leben's dissent in State v. Robison, 58 Kan. App. 2d 380, 395, 469 P.3d 83\n(2020), and Justice Standridge's dissent that I joined in Arnett, slip op. at 19-36, to hold\nthat our criminal restitution statutes are unconstitutional because they allow a judge\u2014\nrather than a jury\u2014to determine how much a criminal defendant must pay in restitution. I\nwould vacate the restitution order entered in this case.\n\n\n\n\n1\nREPORTER'S NOTE: District Judge Daryl D.

But Kansas\nlaw favors the admission of relevant evidence, and the exclusion of relevant evidence\nunder K.S.A. 60-445 is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly.\n\n\n3.\n       Under K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c), a trial court may declare a mistrial if there was\nprejudicial conduct either inside or outside the courtroom that makes it impossible for the\ntrial to proceed without injustice to either the defendant or the prosecution. This statute\n\n\n                                              1\n\fcreates a two-step process. First, the trial court must determine if there was some\nfundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, the trial court moves to the second step and\nassesses whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. In other words, the trial\ncourt must decide if the prejudicial conduct's damaging effect can be removed or\nmitigated by an admonition, jury instruction, or other action. If not, the trial court must\ndetermine whether the degree of prejudice results in an injustice and, if so, declare a\nmistrial. On appeal, the court's abuse of discretion inquiry is divided into two parts,\nasking: (1) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when deciding if there was a\nfundamental failure in the proceeding? and (2) Did the trial court abuse its discretion\nwhen deciding whether the conduct resulted in prejudice that could not be cured or\nmitigated through jury admonition or instruction, resulting in an injustice?\n\n\n4.\n       The State committed prosecutorial error in its closing argument by asserting that\nthe defendant's medical records reflected instances where the defendant missed scheduled\nappointments, but the admitted records did not substantiate this argument. By doing so,\nthe State improperly argued facts not in evidence.\n\n\n5.\n       This court may reverse a defendant's convictions for cumulative error when the\ntotality of the circumstances demonstrate that the defendant was substantially prejudiced\nby cumulative errors and was denied a fair trial.\n\n\n6.\n       Kansas' criminal restitution scheme implicates a defendant's right to trial by jury in\nsection 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights by converting restitution orders, in\nwhich a judge determines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into civil\njudgments, thus bypassing the traditional function of juries to determine civil damages.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fTherefore, a criminal defendant will not be faced with a civil judgment for criminal\nrestitution unless it has been obtained separately through a civil cause of action.\n\n\n        Appeal from Sedgwick County District Court; KEVIN J. O'CONNOR, judge. Opinion filed October\n15, 2021. Affirmed.\n\n\n        Michelle A. Davis, of Kansas Appellate Defender Office, argued the cause and was on the brief\nfor appellant.\n\n\n        Lesley A. Isherwood, assistant district attorney, argued the cause, and Marc Bennett, district\nattorney, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with her on the brief for appellee.\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\n\n\n        WALL, J.: A jury convicted Dane Owens of first-degree felony murder and\naggravated burglary in connection with the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Rowena\nIrani. Owens appeals, arguing that multiple evidentiary, trial, and prosecutorial errors\nrequire reversal of his convictions.\n\n\n        However, upon thorough examination of the record and briefing, we determine\nthat only two potential errors occurred during the proceedings. First, the prosecutor\ncommitted error by referring to a fact not in evidence during closing argument. But this\nerror primarily affected Owens' defense to first-degree, premeditated murder, and the jury\nacquitted Owens of this offense. This fact, along with other circumstances, demonstrate\nthe prosecutorial error was harmless.\n\n\n        Second, we presume, without deciding, that the State's failure to disclose the\nfindings of its pseudo-expert witness before trial constituted a fundamental failure in the\nproceedings. However, the presumed error did not inhibit Owens' defense, and the trial\ncourt implemented ameliorative measures to mitigate potential prejudice, which made it\n\n\n                                                     3\n\fpossible to proceed with the trial without injustice. Thus, the record confirms the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Owens' motion for mistrial.\n\n\n       These two errors were not interrelated in a way that amplified their prejudicial\nforce when viewed together. Whether viewed independently or in the aggregate, these\nerrors did not deprive Owens of a fair trial.\n\n\n       As for Owens' sentence, the district court's restitution order does implicate section\n5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights under the current statutory scheme. Several\nstatutory provisions serve to convert a district court's restitution order, in which a judge\ndetermines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into a civil judgment.\nThrough this process, the statutes bypass the traditional function of Kansas juries to\ndetermine civil damages. However, based on our holding in State v. Arnett, 314 Kan. ___,\n(No. 112,572, this day decided), the constitutional infirmity is cured by severing the\noffending statutory provisions. By severing these provisions, Owens will not be subject to\na civil judgment for his criminal restitution order, unless it is obtained separately through\na civil cause of action. Accordingly, the district court's restitution order satisfies\nconstitutional requirements.\n\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm Owens' convictions and restitution order.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       On October 3, 2016, Owens entered the home of his ex-girlfriend Rowena and\nfired a single bullet, killing Rowena. Police arrested Owens the same day and charged\nhim with premeditated first-degree murder\u2014or felony murder in the alternative\u2014as well\nas aggravated burglary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fPretrial Evidentiary Issues\n\n\n      Before trial, the State moved to determine the admissibility of hearsay statements\nby Rowena. The State sought to introduce testimony from Rowena's brother, Rooshad\nIrani, about statements Rowena had made to him\u2014both in person and via text message\u2014\nconcerning her relationship and breakup with Owens.\n\n\n      Specifically, the State sought to admit Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him\nthat Owens said he had \"dug a hole\" for an ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him. The\nState argued this evidence was relevant in establishing Rowena's state of mind at the time\nof the shooting. Owens opposed the admission of this \"dug a hole\" testimony on several\ngrounds. The district judge found the statements admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d), the contemporaneous statement hearsay exception, because they went to\nRowena's state of mind and the fact that Owens would not have been welcome in her\nhome. The district judge recommended a limiting instruction.\n\n\n      The State also sought to admit the following text messages between Rowena and\nRooshad:\n\n\n        Sender            Message Content\n        Rooshad           \"You and dane working a few things out?\"\n                          \"His fb popped up as complicated relationship.\"\n\n\n        Rowena            \"lord\"\n                          \"he called yesterday saying he wanted to work it out and to\n                          give him a chance all that i told him to give me some time to\n                          think\"\n                          \"mom texted me saying she had a strong feeling he was going\n                          to physically abuse me if i went back\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fSender     Message Content\nRooshad    \"Ok?

Owens\nargued they were not probative of the mindset the State was attempting to establish\nbecause the emojis suggested Rowena truly did not think Owens would shoot her and,\ninstead, she was just annoyed with him. Further, Owens argued \"under the facts of this\ncase, where [he was] accused of intentionally shooting her in the head, that those are\ncertainly more prejudicial than probative.\" The district judge ruled that the texts were\nadmissible.\n\n\nProsecutor's Opening Statement\n\n\n       The case proceeded to a jury trial. In its opening statement, the State informed the\njury that Detective Robert Chisholm had tried on Owens' sling (which Owens wore\nfollowing shoulder surgery on September 29, 2016) and used a gun to reconstruct or test\n\n\n                                               7\n\fOwens' description of how he wielded the gun inside the sling at the time of the shooting.\nBased on this reconstruction, the State said Detective Chisholm would testify that Owens'\naccount of the shooting was not feasible.\n\n\n       After opening statements, Owens moved for a mistrial, arguing the State\ncommitted discovery violations by failing to disclose Detective Chisholm's reconstruction\nanalysis the prosecution had described in opening remarks. The State argued there was no\ndiscovery violation; the gun and the sling would both come in as evidence, and the\ndetective could do this reenactment in front of the jury. The State further argued the jury\nitself could do the same with the gun and sling once it deliberated in the jury room. The\ndistrict court denied the request for mistrial.\n\n\nTrial Evidence\n\n\n       During the trial, Detective Chisholm testified about his interrogation of Owens the\nday of the shooting. According to Chisolm, Owens said he drove his truck to Rowena's\nneighborhood, parked, and walked to her home. He opted not to park in the Irani family's\ndriveway because he did not want them to call the police. Once there, he saw one of the\nfamily's dogs in the front yard. He let the dog inside and followed it into the home. After\nentering the home, Owens said Rowena \"came around the corner, he was startled, she\nwas startled, and the gun just went off.\" Owens then admitted he pulled the trigger. When\nDetective Chisholm asked why, Owens \"kind of shrug[ged] his shoulders\" and said \"I\nmean\u2014I mean, pretty much accepted the fact that we were done.\" Owens claimed he\n\"wasn't trying to hurt anyone,\" and while admittedly angry, he had typically been able to\ncontrol his emotions. But when asked about the breakup with Rowena, Owens said he\nwas \"'blindsided'\" by it and was tired of being \"'fucked over.'\" He said he took the gun to\nRowena's house \"so she would take him seriously.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       Detective Chisholm said Owens informed law enforcement that he threw his\nhandgun, magazine, and Rowena's cell phone in ponds near his parents' house. Police\nwere able to fish out the gun, a .45 caliber Smith and Wesson. Detective Chisholm\ntestified the gun had a 7-pound trigger pull and a trigger safety preventing the weapon\nfrom firing unless a finger was on the lower part of the trigger. Owens told Detective\nChisholm that he always carried the handgun around, but it was usually in a backpack.\nOwens said he had the gun inside the sling he was wearing on his right arm when he\nentered Rowena's home. He also informed Detective Chisholm that he is right-handed but\nshoots left-handed.\n\n\n       Before trial, Detective Chisholm decided to see if it was feasible to hold the gun\ninside the sling; he tried on the sling and held a gun inside it in the way Owens described.\nDetective Chisholm went through this same reconstruction while on the stand. Through\nthis process, Detective Chisholm determined the gun's slide would have been obstructed\nby the sling. He reasoned that, if the slide was obstructed by the sling, the shell casing\nwould not have ended up where it was ultimately found in the Iranis' home. Further,\nOwens told Detective Chisholm that as he left the Iranis' home, he had a live bullet in the\ngun's chamber. To Detective Chisholm, this suggested the gun's slide likely was not\nobstructed at the time of the shooting. Detective Chisholm also observed no burns,\nabrasions, or other marks on the sling indicating that a gun had been fired inside it.\n\n\n       During Detective Chisholm's testimony, the State also admitted into evidence the\nvideo of Owens' interrogation by police. On this video, Owens provides detectives with\nhis account of the shooting and demonstrates how he wielded the gun in his sling. Owens\nalso admitted during the interview that he sometimes told lies for attention, like when he\nclaimed that he \"dug a hole'\" for a previous ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him. The\ndistrict judge overruled Owens' objections to these \"dug a hole\" comments.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       On cross-examination, Detective Chisholm acknowledged that Owens reported\ndealing with shoulder and back injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\ndepression, and traumatic brain injury. Owens said he had been prescribed medication for\nsome of his mental health issues and was seeking treatment from the Veterans\nAdministration in Wichita and a therapist in Manhattan.\n\n\n       Rooshad testified for the State. He said Rowena told him she broke up with Owens\non September 23, 2016. He testified that Owens texted him on September 27 and 28\nabout Rowena. Then, on Friday September 30, Rooshad texted Owens, \"'You and my\nsister are done. Stop bothering her via text, Facebook, and phone calls or she will file\nharassment charges. It is over. Move on. Thank you.'\"\n\n\n       Rooshad also said that on September 23, 2016, Rowena told him that she spoke\nwith Owens and that Owens said he wanted to get married and start a family soon, which\n\"freaked\" Rowena out. Rooshad testified that according to Rowena, Owens then said that\n\"well, if that freaks you out, then you should know what I have done when I was at war. I\nhave shot and killed men, women, and children.\" Then, Owens \"made a comment of\nhaving a previous girlfriend in his life who had broken up with him a number of years\nprior, and that he had dug a hole for her with a shovel in his truck.\" Rooshad said\nRowena took these statements \"seriously.\"\n\n\n       The State also admitted a recorded phone call with Owens' mother from October 3,\n2016. The State was supposed to have redacted from the call certain law enforcement\nphone numbers, a hold time, and Owens' mother's request for an attorney when asked if\nshe would consent to a search of her home. But the copy that was played for the jury was\nunredacted. In response, Owens renewed his motion for a mistrial. The State opposed the\nmotion, arguing that \"frankly, putting on the fact that a parent doesn't want to have\nofficers search their home, car, or whatever, without a lawyer, without talking to\nsomebody first . . . it certainly does not prejudice the defendant.\" The district judge\n\n\n                                             10\n\ffound the material that was supposed to be redacted was not prejudicial to Owens and\ndenied the motion. The district judge offered to give a limiting instruction, but Owens\ndeclined.\n\n\n       The defense put on several witnesses of their own. Sergeant First Class Steve\nFrye\u2014Owens' former Army squad leader\u2014testified that at 19 years old, Owens saw\nactive combat in Afghanistan and encountered multiple IEDs. On cross, he said Owens\nwas highly trained with firearms and was instructed to always treat them as loaded and\nnever point them at something you do not intend to kill. SFC Frye also testified that\nOwens was a left-handed shooter.\n\n\n       Owens' orthopedic surgeon testified about the September 29, 2016 outpatient\nsurgery performed on Owens' right shoulder. The surgeon testified the surgery did not\naffect the function in Owens' right hand, or his left hand for that matter. The defense also\nadmitted two sets of Owens' medical records: one from the Veterans Administration, and\nthe other from Lafene Health Center in Manhattan.\n\n\n       Finally, Owens' mother testified that Owens' demeanor changed when he returned\nfrom Afghanistan. He would be startled if people touched him and did not like to ride in\nthe front seat of vehicles. While in vehicles, he was constantly observing the road, as if\nlooking for IEDs. Owens was prescribed medication to deal with these issues; the\nmedication helped, but when Owens was off the medication, he was \"jumpy,\" \"agitated,\"\nand \"seemed to be paranoid.\"\n\n\nJury Instructions, Closing Argument, and Verdict\n\n\n       During the jury instruction conference, the district judge proposed the following\naggravated burglary instruction:\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f          \"The defendant is charged with aggravated burglary. The defendant pleads not\nguilty.\n\n\n          \"To establish this charge, each of the following claims must be proved:\n\n\n          1. The defendant entered a dwelling.\n          2. The defendant did so without authority.\n          3. The defendant did so with the intent to commit aggravated assault therein.\n          4. At the time there was a human being in the dwelling.\n          5. This act occurred on or about the 3rd day of October, 2016, in Sedgwick\n          County, Kansas.\n\n\n          \"The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime intentionally. A\ndefendant acts intentionally when it is the defendant's desire or conscious objective to do\nthe act complained about by the State.\n\n\n                  \"The elements of aggravated assault are as follows:\n\n\n                  1. The defendant knowingly placed Rowena Irani in reasonable\n          apprehension of immediate bodily harm.\n                  2. The defendant did so with a deadly weapon.\n                  3.

An object\n          can be a deadly weapon if the user intended to convince a person that it is a\n          deadly weapon and that person reasonably believed it to be a deadly weapon.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fOwens did not object to this instruction.\n\n\n       The district judge also included a limiting instruction addressing the \"dug a hole\"\ncomment.\n\n\n                      \"Evidence has been admitted tending to suggest that the defendant\n              claimed to have considered an act of violence against a prior girlfriend. No\n              evidence has been admitted to establish that these acts actually occurred.\n\n\n                      \"Evidence that such a statement was allegedly made by the defendant to\n              Rowena Irani may be considered solely for the purpose of establishing the nature\n              of Ms. Irani's relationship with defendant and her state of mind in late September\n              2016 to October 3, 2016. It is not to be considered by you for any other purpose.\"\n\n\n       During Owens' closing, he did not deny shooting Rowena but argued that the\nshooting was \"a terrible accident\" and asked for a voluntary manslaughter conviction. He\npointed to his post-combat mental health issues to support his argument that the shooting\nwas unintentional because he was jumpy and paranoid.\n\n\n       During closing rebuttal, the State argued for an intentional first-degree murder\nconviction. The prosecutor addressed Owens' argument that his PTSD, traumatic brain\ninjury, and mental health issues contributed to the shooting. The prosecutor argued that\nthe medical records demonstrated Owens had not consistently sought treatment and had\nmissed scheduled appointments. The prosecutor also encouraged the jury to consider all\nthe evidence of premeditation and challenged Owens' account of the shooting.\n\n\n       The jury convicted Owens of first-degree felony murder and aggravated burglary.\nOwens was acquitted of first-degree premeditated murder. The district judge sentenced\nOwens to a hard 25 life sentence plus 43 months and ordered Owens to pay $7,470.64 in\nrestitution. Owens appealed his convictions and restitution order.\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                               ANALYSIS\n\n\nThe District Judge Did Not Abuse His Discretion in Admitting Challenged Evidence\n\n      Owens first challenges the district judge's admission of two sets of statements. The\nfirst statements are Rooshad's testimony that Rowena told him about Owens' comments\nabout \"digging a hole\" for an ex-girlfriend. The second statements include a text\nexchange between Rowena and Rooshad where Rowena said, \"[M]om texted me saying\nshe had a strong feeling he was going to physically abuse me if I went back,\" and texts\nfrom the same chain between Rowena and Rooshad involving the emojis and the\ncomment \"what's the worse that'll happen hell take a rifle and shoot me.\" Owens claims\nboth sets of statements constituted inadmissible hearsay and were unduly prejudicial.\n\n\n      Standard of Review\n\n\n      \"'This court reviews a trial court's determination that hearsay is admissible under a\n      statutory exception . . . for an abuse of discretion.'

The State offered this testimony to\nestablish Rowena's state of mind and the fact that she would not have willingly let Owens\ninto her home\u2014which supported the \"entering a dwelling without authority\" element of\naggravated burglary. Owens objected to the admission of this testimony, claiming it did\nnot fit within the statutory hearsay exception, particularly when Rooshad could be\nmotivated by animosity to distort the statements. Owens also argued the evidence should\nbe excluded because it was not relevant and was more prejudicial than probative.\n\n\n       The district judge found the testimony admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d) because it went to Rowena's state of mind and the fact that Owens would not have\nbeen welcome in her home. The district judge ruled:\n\n\n               \"So I do think\u2014and I understand that the defense doesn't want to be defending\n       against another alleged incident that may or may not have occurred. And I also\n       understand and appreciate why the State wants to introduce this. It goes to her state of\n       mind. It also goes to why she would have said, 'I don't want to have anything to do with\n       you anymore.'\n\n\n               \"And it also goes to the fact that he would not have had permission to go into her\n       residence, which may be an issue, because oftentimes, a boyfriend or a girlfriend would\n       have permission to come into a residence of a parent or a family member. So under the\n       analysis, under 60-460(d), I'm going to find that the statement is admissible.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\f       Rooshad's testimony about Owens' \"dug a hole\" comment may qualify as double\nhearsay. Therefore, each layer must be analyzed to determine its admissibility. See\nK.S.A. 60-463 (\"A statement within the scope of an exception to K.S.A. 60-460 shall not\nbe inadmissible on the ground that it includes a statement made by another declarant and\nis offered to prove the truth of the included statement if such included statement itself\nmeets the requirements of an exception.\").\n\n\n       The first layer is Owens' declaration to Rowena that he \"dug a hole\" for an ex-\ngirlfriend. The State never offered this statement for the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that\nis, to argue that Owens did in fact dig a grave for an ex-girlfriend. Indeed, the State\nwillingly agreed to an instruction that \"[n]o evidence has been admitted to establish that\nthese acts actually occurred.\" Thus, this first layer is not hearsay. See K.S.A. 2020 Supp.\n60-460 (hearsay evidence is \"[e]vidence of a statement which is made other than by a\nwitness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the matter stated\").\n\n\n       The second layer\u2014Rowena's declaration conveying Owens' \"dug a hole\" comment\nto her brother\u2014is, however, hearsay because it was offered by the State to establish that\nOwens did indeed tell Rowena he dug a hole for his ex-girlfriend. The district judge\nfound the evidence admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d), which creates an\nexception to the general rule excluding hearsay for certain contemporaneous statements,\nincluding:\n\n\n       \"A statement which the judge finds was made: (1) While the declarant was perceiving\n       the event or condition which the statement narrates, describes or explains; (2) while the\n       declarant was under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception; or\n       (3) if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, by the declarant at a time when the matter\n       had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the declarant's recollection was\n       clear and was made in good faith prior to the commencement of the action and with no\n       incentive to falsify or to distort.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    16\n\f       On appeal, Owens argues this conversation was inadmissible hearsay because the\nState did not establish that the statement was \"(1) contemporaneous, made by Rowena\nwhen the matter had been recently perceived and while her recollection was clear, and\n(2) made in good faith with no incentive to falsify or to distort.\" Further, Owens argues\nthat \"[a]ny probative value was outweighed by unduly prejudicial effect.\"\n\n\n       Ultimately, Owens fails to establish that the district judge abused his discretion by\nadmitting the \"dug a hole\" evidence under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d) and finding that\nthe probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by the risk of\nunfair prejudice under K.S.A. 60-445.\n\n\n       The district judge's admission of the testimony under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-\n460(d) did not constitute a mistake of law or fact; nor was it arbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable. Lemmie, 311 Kan. at 449-50. As noted, K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3)\nprovides for admission of testimony where the statement is made by a declarant: (1) who\nis unavailable as a witness; (2) at a time when the matter had been recently perceived and\nthe declarant's recollection clear; and (3) with no incentive to falsify or distort.\n\n\n       The record establishes that the challenged evidence satisfies all three statutory\nrequirements for admission. First, Rowena was unavailable because she had been\nmurdered. See State v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">293 Kan. 1002</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1025, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">270 P.3d 1183</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n(concluding that murder victim \"clearly was unavailable as a witness\").\n\n\n       The record also supports the district judge's finding that the statements were\ncontemporaneous. The State's evidence indicated that Rowena told Rooshad about\nOwens' \"dug a hole\" comments about one week after Owens made them to her. No\nevidence suggests Rowena's recollection was unclear after having perceived Owens'\nstatements several days prior. In fact, the testimony established that Rowena took Owens'\nstatements seriously, and it is reasonable to infer from this evidence that the statements\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmade a lasting impression upon her. The district judge did not abuse his discretion by\nconcluding that Rowena recounted this conversation to Rooshad \"at a time when the\nmatter had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the declarant's recollection\nwas clear.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3); see State v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">313 Kan. 972</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 986-87,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">492 P.3d 418</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021) (statements made in the year leading up to murder were \"close\nenough in time to be considered contemporaneous.\").\n\n\n       Finally, Owens speculates that Rowena might have had incentive to distort the\nstatements to justify to her brother the decision to end the relationship with Owens.\nHowever, Rooshad's testimony reasonably inferred that Rowena's account was genuine\nand she took Owens' statements seriously. No evidence suggests Rowena made these\nstatements in bad faith or with an incentive to falsify or distort them. See Robinson, 293\nKan. at 1026 (concluding district court did not abuse discretion where evidence did not\nsupport declarant's assertion that declarant made statements in bad faith). We find no\nerror in the admission of this evidence under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3).\n\n\n       With respect to the probative value and undue prejudice analysis, K.S.A. 60-445,\nprovides:\n\n\n               \"Except as in this article otherwise provided, the judge may in his or her\n       discretion exclude evidence if he or she finds that its probative value is substantially\n       outweighed by the risk that its admission will unfairly and harmfully surprise a party who\n       has not had reasonable opportunity to anticipate that such evidence would be offered.\"\n\n\n\"While [K.S.A. 60-445] talks only of the risk of unfair surprise, it has long been applied\nmuch more broadly\u2014excluding evidence if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.\" Satchell, 311 Kan. at 640. In reviewing this\nissue, we remain mindful that Kansas law favors the admission of relevant evidence, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n\fthe exclusion of relevant evidence under K.S.A. 60-445 is an extraordinary remedy that\nshould be used sparingly. State v. Ross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">310 Kan. 216</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">445 P.3d 726</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2019).\n\n\n       Here, the district judge found the testimony was probative because it tended to\nestablish Rowena's state of mind and that she would not have allowed Owens into her\nhome. In turn, such evidence was probative of the third element of aggravated burglary,\nwhether defendant entered an occupied dwelling without permission. See K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 21-5807(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A). Owens argues that Rooshad's \"dug a hole\" testimony\nwas more prejudicial than probative because it suggested to the jury that Owens had a\nhistory of violence towards partners, and it had little probative value because Rowena's\nstate of mind was not a material fact in dispute.\n\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the district judge's conclusion that the probative\nvalue of this testimony was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the risk of unfair prejudice.\nFirst, the district judge correctly observed that Rowena's account of Owens' statements\ntended to support the conclusion that Rowena would not have allowed Owens into her\nhome, a fact relevant to an essential element of the aggravated burglary count. The State\nhad the burden to prove this essential element at trial, even if Owens did not affirmatively\ncontrovert the element or Rowena's state of mind. The testimony was also probative of\nthe nature of the relationship between Rowena and Owens during the days leading up to\nher death, explaining possible motive for Owens' conduct and behavior. See Evans, 313\nKan. at 989 (evidence providing background context of the parties' relationship was\nprobative of defendant's motive that supplied \"the jury with some degree of explanation,\nresponding to a juror's natural tendency to wonder why a defendant behaved in the\nmanner described by the State\").\n\n\n       Additionally, the admission of this testimony was not unduly prejudicial. Owens'\n\"dug a hole\" story had already been presented to the jury through Owens' interrogation\nvideo and Detective Chisholm's testimony, and Owens does not challenge the admission\n\n\n                                             19\n\fof this evidence on appeal. So the only new information that came from Rooshad's\ntestimony was that Owens had told Rowena the same story.\n\n\n         The district judge also gave a cautionary jury instruction stating that \"no evidence\n[had] been admitted to establish\" that Owens actually dug a hole for his ex-girlfriend. The\ninstruction made clear that \"[e]vidence that such a statement was allegedly made\" could\n\"be considered solely for the purpose of establishing the nature of Ms. Irani's relationship\nwith defendant and her state of mind in late September 2016 to October 3, 2016.\" Jurors\nwere directed not to consider this evidence \"for any other purpose.\" See State v. Dean,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">310 Kan. 848</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862-63, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">450 P.3d 819</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2019) (prejudicial effect of defendant's affiliation\nwith gangs may be cured by a limiting instruction); see also State v.

The defense argued that\nthe messages showed Rowena was joking and considered the idea that Owens posed a\nthreat preposterous. Also before trial, Owens opposed admission of this text message\nchain on two grounds. His counsel stated:\n\n\n              \"So I have an objection to State's 121 [the pretrial exhibit containing these text\n      messages], twofold: One, the reference to: 'What's he going to do, take a rifle and shoot\n      me?' If it goes to her state of mind, then her state of mind is, 'What's the worst he could\n      do? It's not going to happen.' And then she laughs about it with three laughing emojis to\n      the point where the emoji is crying.\n\n\n              \"And then the following page, it talks about a story of her life being that he's\n      wanting to get back together with her, and that [Owens] is getting on her fucking nerves,\n      and so she wants to shoot herself in the head. I would argue under the facts of this case,\n      where my client is accused of intentionally shooting her in the head, that those are\n      certainly more prejudicial than probative.\"\n\n\n      At trial, Owens did not make any new arguments objecting to the admission of\nthese texts, but instead \"renew[ed] [his] previous hearsay objections.\" Like Rooshad's\ntestimony, the district judge ruled that the texts were admissible under K.S.A. 2020 Supp.\n60-460(d). On appeal, Owens argues that these texts \"had limited probative value\" and\nwere \"cumulative and unnecessary and very prejudicial.\"\n\n\n      To begin with, Owens' trial objection to the \"strong feeling he was going to\nphysically abuse me\" text message was only to voice a difference of opinion on how the\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fevidence should be interpreted. Owens did not lodge specific objection to the\nadmissibility of this text message at trial. By challenging the \"strong feeling\" text as\nunduly prejudicial on appeal, Owens' argument is akin to objecting on one ground below\nand arguing a different one on appeal. We have consistently held that such arguments are\nnot preserved properly for appeal. See State v. Dukes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">290 Kan. 485</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630046\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630046/state-v-dukes/\">231 P.3d 558</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2010) (\"Recently, we stated that 'the trial court must be provided the specific objection\nso it may consider as fully as possible whether the evidence should be admitted and\ntherefore reduce the chances of reversible error.' Specifically, in Richmond we refused to\nallow the defendant to object on one ground at trial and then argue another on appeal.\n[Citation omitted.]\"). Because Owens did not specifically object to this text message\ncommunication at trial, the district court was never given the opportunity to fully\nconsider its admissibility. We will not consider Owens' unpreserved arguments about the\n\"strong feeling\" text. State v. Gaona, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">293 Kan. 930</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">270 P.3d 1165</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (\"If a\nparty fails to make a specific contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence or\ntestimony at trial, objection to that evidence or testimony is not preserved for appeal.\").\n\n\n       Second, the hearsay objection that Owens did preserve is unfounded. The analysis\nharkens us back to the definition of hearsay: \"Evidence of a statement which is made\nother than by a witness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the\nmatter stated.\" K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460. Most of the remaining messages in the\nchallenged texts were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted because they are not\ndeclarations and do not assert any matter. The \"what's the worse that'll happen\"\nstatement, though ominous, was not offered by the State to show that this was indeed the\nworst thing that could happen, or that Rowena believed it was the worst thing that could\nhappen. Instead, it was offered as insight to Rowena's state of mind. Furthermore, this\nwas a rhetorical question that did not attempt to establish the truth of any asserted matter.\n\n\n       Similarly, Owens fails to make a case on appeal that the emojis\u2014specifically the\nsmiling one with the bead of sweat and the gun directed at it\u2014contain or express the truth\n\n\n                                             22\n\fof a matter being asserted. Thus, the emojis cannot be characterized as hearsay\nstatements.\n\n\n       The only message from this group of texts that can be properly characterized as\nbeing offered for the truth of the matter asserted was Rowena's statement \"getting on my\nfuckin nerves,\" which is an assertion that Owens was bothering her. Nevertheless, the\ndistrict judge found that these messages, to the extent they were hearsay, were admissible\nunder K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d), finding: \"She is perceiving the matter about which\nthe statements are made while her recollection is clear.\"\n\n\n       We hold the district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that the\nportions of these texts that were hearsay, if any, were admissible under K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 60-460(d)(3), the contemporaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule. This\ndeclaration (\"getting on my fuckin nerves\") explains Rowena's state of mind moments\nafter Rooshad forwarded her a screenshot of Owens' texts. In turn, this state of mind\nevidence provided insight into the nature of her relationship with Owens leading up to the\nshooting. And Owens has not established on appeal that Rowena had incentive to falsify\nor distort this reaction. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\ntext messages under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 60-460(d)(3).\n\n\n       With respect to the K.S.A. 60-445 probative value and prejudice concerns, we find\nno abuse of discretion in the district judge's conclusion that the probative value of the\ntexts was not \"substantially outweighed\" by the threat of unfair prejudice. As with\nRooshad's testimony above, the text messages were probative because a juror could\nreasonably infer from them that Rowena would not have given Owens permission to\nenter her family's home. The evidence was also probative of Owens' motive. In turn,\nOwens fails to explain why the emoji text messages were unfairly prejudicial in his brief\non appeal. This court cannot independently develop an argument for prejudice on Owens'\nbehalf. See State v. Lowery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">308 Kan. 1183</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">427 P.3d 865</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2018) (\"'A point raised\n\n\n                                              23\n\fincidentally in a brief and not argued therein is deemed abandoned.'\"). Accordingly, we\nconclude the district judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying the Mistrial Motions\n\n\n       Owens next argues the district judge committed reversible error by twice denying\nhis requests for a mistrial. Owens first moved for a mistrial on the first day of trial. He\nargued the State surprised him during opening argument when it first disclosed that\nDetective Chisholm had performed a reconstruction using Owens' sling and gun and\nclaimed this reconstruction would show Owens' account of the shooting was implausible.\n\n\n       Owens renewed his motion later in the trial when the State failed to redact the\nrecording of a phone call between a detective and Owens' mother, wherein Owens'\nmother said she wanted to consult with an attorney before consenting to law\nenforcement's search of her house. The district judge denied both requests. We address\neach request in turn.\n\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n\n       This court explained the procedure and applicable standard of review for mistrial\nrequests in State v. Waller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">299 Kan. 707</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725-26, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">328 P.3d 1111</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014):\n\n\n               \"Under K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c), a trial court may declare a mistrial if there was\n       prejudicial conduct either inside or outside the courtroom that makes it impossible for the\n       trial to proceed without injustice to either the defendant or the prosecution. This statute\n       creates a two-step process. First, the trial court must determine if there was some\n       fundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, the trial court moves to the second step and\n       assesses whether it is possible to continue without an injustice.

But they did find the\nfirearm.\n\n\n           \"Detective Chisholm has been with the homicide unit probably 25 years. He\nknows more about guns than most people will, in his experience personally and through\nlaw enforcement. But he also sent the gun to the Forensic Science Center for the firearms\nexaminer to look at it and compare it with the bullet that they had found to see what\ninformation he could give.

And if the gun won't fit, the mechanism to discharge the cartridge wouldn't\nwork right. And you will hear and you will see this as well.\"\n\n\nOwens requested a mistrial, stating:\n\n\n           \"During the course of the State's opening statement, we were told for the first\ntime that apparently the case agent conducted some experiment on a piece of evidence\nand then reached certain conclusions that the story couldn't have been the way my client\nsaid it because of the way the casing was ejected from the firearm. There has been no\nreport provided on any kind of scientific or experimental testing by the State. I certainly\nhaven't been given so much as an email about it, so I move for mistrial at this time.\nThey've already told the jury about some piece of evidence that I have never been told\nabout. Apparently, it's some kind of test done by the case agent that he hasn't written a\nreport on. I'd be shocked if there wasn't an email from somewhere saying, 'Hey, fellows,\nthis is what I did and this is what happened.' So I believe it's a blatant discovery violation\nand I move for mistrial.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       The State countered that Detective Chisholm had just conducted this\nreconstruction the Friday before trial began (on the following Tuesday) and it would\nquestion Detective Chisholm about this issue on the stand. Further, the State highlighted\nthat both the gun and the sling were going to be admitted as evidence, and Kansas law\npermitted the jury to take both the gun and the sling back into the jury room where jurors\ncould conduct the same experiment of their own accord, if they wished.\n\n\n       The district judge denied the request for a mistrial, reasoning:\n\n\n       \"I don't see it as a scientific experiment. I don't see it as expert testimony; and the remedy\n       for finding this out during opening statement which, again, I would state they could have\n       just had Detective Chisholm testify and done it right there and then, and it could have\n       been something that came to them during the direct examination of Detective Chisholm,\n       with the items here and have him try it.\n\n\n                \"But also, then, if the defense wants an opportunity before Detective Chisholm\n       testifies to see what and how he did this examination of the evidence, I will allow for\n       that.\"\n\n\nThe defense confirmed that it wanted the opportunity to see Detective Chisholm's\ndemonstration and examination before he testified.\n\n\n       On direct examination, the State highlighted Detective Chisholm's familiarity with\nand expertise in firearms but did not designate him as an expert. Over the defense's\nobjection, Detective Chisholm demonstrated his reenactment for the jury, putting on the\nsling, holding the gun, and explaining that he did not believe Owens' account of the\nshooting was true because if the gun were in the sling, the casing would not have ended\nup on the staircase where crime scene technicians ultimately found it. The defense cross-\nexamined him about his reenactment and conclusions. Detective Chisholm admitted that\nhe \"wouldn't say that [he] had any real findings\" based on the demonstration. He also\n\n\n                                                    27\n\fobserved that there were no burns on the sling, but he admitted the sling was not tested\nfor gunpowder residue.\n\n\n       On appeal, Owens argues that the \"surprise\" in the State's opening statement was\nfundamentally unfair because the defense was \"unprepared to counter the evidence that\nthe State had just proffered.\" The State counters that no fundamental unfairness occurred\nbecause the evidence the State promised \"was no different than what the jury witnessed\ndefendant demonstrating on video during his interview, and no different than what the\ndetective illustrated during his own testimony before the jury.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the State used Detective Chisholm as more or less a pseudo-expert,\noutlining his experience with firearms and expertise in their function, despite never\nformally designating him an expert. Because Detective Chisholm was never officially\ndesignated an expert, the State did not disclose to the defense his \"demonstration,\" his\nqualifications, or any of the underlying grounds or basis supporting the reliability of his\nopinions. We presume without deciding that the failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's\ndemonstration before trial was a fundamental failure in the proceeding. See Waller, 299\nKan. at 725.\n\n\n       Presuming error, we move to the second step of the analysis and determine\nwhether such a fundamental failure \"caused prejudice that could not be cured or mitigated\nthrough jury admonition or instruction or other means, resulting in an injustice.\" State v.\nCorey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">304 Kan. 721</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">374 P.3d 654</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016). Owens argues that \"[f]undamental\nfairness would have allowed the defense, pretrial, to seek its own firearms 'familiar'\nwitness demonstration, taking into account Mr. Owens' unique physique.\" As the State\npoints out, Owens was \"never deprived of such an opportunity.\" His defense, dating back\nto the initial interrogation, was always that he fired the gun by accident. He could have\nhired an expert at any point to bolster this theory by showing that his accidental-shooting-\nfrom-inside-the-sling theory was feasible. See State v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">284 Kan. 333</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343, 161\n\n\n                                             </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28\n\fP.3d 208</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007) (district court did not err in denying mistrial motion where prosecutor's\nfailure to disclose change in expert testimony did not destroy, or even change, the theory\nof defense), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in State v.

The defense thoroughly cross-\nexamined Detective Chisholm about the demonstration on the stand. Insomuch as the\ndefense was caught off-guard by the State's opening, we cannot say this resulted in\nincurable prejudice. Further, as to the prosecutor's opening remarks, the jury was\nappropriately instructed that \"[s]tatements, arguments, and remarks of counsel are\nintended to help you in understanding the evidence and in applying the law, but they are\nnot evidence. If any statements are made that are not supported by evidence, they should\nbe disregarded.\" See State v. Kleypas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">305 Kan. 224</span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. \u00b6 16, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">382 P.3d 373</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016)\n(Generally, we presume juries follow a court's instructions, and a defendant must come\nforward with some evidence to overcome the presumption to demonstrate grounds for\nmistrial.).\n\n\n       The State's failure to disclose Detective Chisholm's reconstruction did not result in\nincurable prejudice, resulting in an injustice. We hold that the district judge did not abuse\nhis discretion by denying Owens' request for mistrial.\n\n\n       The Second Mistrial Motion\n\n\n       Owens lodged his second motion for a mistrial after the State played an\nunredacted version of a recorded phone call between police and Owens' mother. Before\nplaying the recording, the State represented to the defense and to the court that it had\n\n\n                                             29\n\fredacted the portion of the tape where Owens' mother said she wanted to consult an\nattorney in response to a detective's request to search her home. Yet, the recording that\nthe State played was not redacted. Owens moved for a mistrial because \"[w]e were told,\nspecifically, that that information would not be played in front of the jury, and it was.\"\n\n\n       The district judge denied the request, reasoning:\n\n\n               \"The evidence that was presented\u2014the issue is Ms. Owens saying that she wasn't\n       sure she wanted the police to search their house and asking if she needed a lawyer, which\n       the question really is whether it is admissible or not as it relates to Mr. Owens, who is on\n       trial. It is evidence that the parties had agreed would not come in. It did come in, and if it\n       is admissible evidence, it is not overly prejudicial to this defendant, because it does not\n       affect any rights that he, himself, exerted. He, at that time, was 27 some-odd-years old.\"\n\n\nThe district judge also offered a limiting instruction directing jurors to disregard Owens'\nmother's comment about an attorney. Owens declined the instruction, motivated by a\ndesire to \"not ring the bell again.\"\n\n\n       We again return to the two-step framework from Waller, 299 Kan. at 725-26.\nFirst, we consider whether the district judge abused his discretion by finding no\nfundamental failure in the proceeding had occurred. Owens argues the district judge \"did\nnot address the unfairness to the defense. Instead, [Owens claims] the court minimized\nthe damage, stating it was 'not shocking' that [Owens' mother] was reluctant to agree to a\nsearch of her home.\" Moreover, Owens suggests \"[a]ny implication that Mr. Owens'\nfamily had something to hide, or were protecting him, was damaging to his defense,\nwhich was based on credibility.\"\n\n\n       We hold that the district judge did not abuse his discretion by finding that the\npresentation of the unredacted tape was not a fundamental failure in the proceedings. A\njury could reasonably understand why Owens' mother may have wanted to consult with\n\n\n                                                    30\n\fan attorney before agreeing to a search of her home. The jury's knowledge that Owens'\nmother wanted an attorney's advice did not amount to a fundamental failure. See, e.g.,\nState v. Rice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613581/state-v-rice/\">261 Kan. 567</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613581/state-v-rice/\">932 P.2d 981</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997) (The district judge did not abuse\nhis discretion by denying a motion for mistrial after a police officer testified that the\ndefendant invoked his right to counsel, where \"jury was told to draw no negative\nimplication from Rice's decision not to talk with police before talking with his attorney\nand no further mention of the incident was made.\"). And Owens fails to establish that any\nprejudicial inference would have been attributed to him, rather than his mother. Finally,\nthe district judge offered a limiting instruction here, but Owens declined it.\n\n\n       Because we find no error in the district court's conclusion that there was no\nfundamental failure in the proceedings, we need not proceed to the second step and\nconsider prejudice. Accordingly, we hold that the district judge did not commit reversible\nerror by denying Owens' motions for mistrial.\n\n\nThe Aggravated Burglary Instruction Was Not Clearly Erroneous\n\n\n       Owens next argues that the district judge committed reversible instructional error.\nSpecifically, he challenges the definition of \"knowingly\" that the district judge provided\nin the aggravated burglary instruction.\n\n\n       Standard of Review\n\n\n               \"This court follows a four-step progression when reviewing challenges to jury\n       instructions: First, it considers the reviewability of the issue from both jurisdiction and\n       preservation viewpoints, exercising an unlimited standard of review; next, it applies\n       unlimited review to determine whether the instruction was legally appropriate; then, it\n       determines whether there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\n       the defendant or the requesting party, that would have supported the instruction; and\n       finally, if the district court erred, this court determines whether the error was harmless,\n\n\n                                                    31\n\f       utilizing the test and degree of certainty set forth in State v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460345/state-v-ward/\">292 Kan. 541</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460345/state-v-ward/\">256\n       P.3d 801</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011), cert. denied </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">565 U.S. 1221</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012).\" State v.

Instructional error is clearly erroneous when\n\"'the reviewing court is firmly convinced that the jury would have reached a different\nverdict had the instruction error not occurred.'\" State v. Dominguez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">299 Kan. 567</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">328 P.3d 1094</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014).\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       The State argues that Owens is not entitled to relief on this front because he not\nonly assented to the district judge's proposed instruction containing the challenged\ndefinition of \"knowingly,\" but in fact invited the error by requesting the same definition\nin his proposed instructions. The invited error argument is baseless because Owens\nproposed this definition of \"knowingly\" in the context of an instruction titled \"homicide\ndefinitions,\" not as part of the instruction on the elements for aggravated burglary and\naggravated assault. Owens therefore did not invite the error he now complains of, that is,\nthe district court's definition of \"knowingly\" in the aggravated burglary instruction.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, Owens did not object to the district court's instruction at trial. Thus,\nthe clear error framework applies. State v. Boeschling, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">311 Kan. 124</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">458 P.3d 234</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2020) (\"[T]he clear error framework applies when a party fails to object to an instruction\nbelow but claims that instruction is error on appeal.\").\n\n\n       The State charged Owens with aggravated burglary. Under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-\n5807(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A), the elements of aggravated burglary are:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    32\n\f       1. Without authority\n       2. Entering a dwelling\n       3. While another person was inside said dwelling\n       4. With the intent to commit a felony therein.\n\n\n       The felony that the State alleged Owens intended to commit inside the home\n(under the fourth element of aggravated burglary) was aggravated assault. K.S.A. 2020\nSupp. 21-5412 defines aggravated assault as \"knowingly placing another person in\nreasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm\" using a deadly weapon. Thus, the\nculpable mental state for aggravated assault is \"knowingly.\"\n\n\n       Owens argues that the district judge erred by instructing the jury, with respect to\nthe aggravated assault underlying the aggravated burglary, that \"[a] defendant acts\nknowingly when the defendant is aware of the nature of his conduct that the State\ncomplains about.\" This is PIK Crim 4th 52.010 option 1 for the definition of\n\"knowingly.\" Owens contends the district judge should have instructed the jury that a\ndefendant acts knowingly \"'when he or she was aware that his or her conduct was\nreasonably certain to cause the result.'\" This is PIK Crim 4th 52.010 option 3 for the\ndefinition of \"knowingly.\"\n\n\n       We disagree because the district court's instruction was legally appropriate. In this\ncase, any distinction between the two definitions of \"knowingly\" is one without legal\nsignificance. The definition of \"knowingly\" in the instruction as given meant that the jury\nhad to find that Owens was aware of the nature of the conduct of which the State\ncomplains. In other words, Owens had to be aware that his conduct was reasonably\ncertain to put Rowena in fear. Defendant's proposed definition of \"knowingly\" conveyed\nthe same meaning. The district court's denial of the requested instruction was not clearly\nerroneous because the instruction as given properly and fairly stated the law as applied to\nthe facts of the case. See State v. Pabst, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2543721\"><a href=\"/opinion/2543721/state-v-pabst/\">273 Kan. 658</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2543721\"><a href=\"/opinion/2543721/state-v-pabst/\">44 P.3d 1230</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002) (where\n\n\n                                             33\n\fdistrict court denies requested instruction, appellate court focuses inquiry on whether\ninstruction given properly and fairly stated the law as applied to the facts of the case).\n\n\n       Furthermore, the record was rife with evidence of Owens' \"knowledge,\" i.e., that\nOwens was aware that his conduct would place Rowena in reasonable apprehension of\nimmediate bodily harm. Based on Owens' own account of the incident during\ninterrogation, he decided to park down the street, rather than in Rowena's driveway, to\navoid detection. Owens entered Rowena's house with a gun to be \"take[n] . . . seriously.\"\nHe carried the gun in the sling, without concealing it entirely, because he wanted Rowena\nto know he had a gun. He said he was \"pissed\" at Rowena because she did not give him a\n\"legitimate explanation\" for the breakup. Based on this evidence, we are not firmly\nconvinced that the jury would have reached a different verdict under Owens' requested\ninstruction.\n\n\n       For these reasons, the district court's aggravated burglary instruction was legally\nproper, factually appropriate, and not clearly erroneous.\n\n\nThe Prosecutor Committed Harmless Error in Closing\n\n\n       Owens next argues that the State committed reversible prosecutorial error. First,\nOwens complains that the prosecutor inappropriately used the \"dug a hole\" evidence to\n\"show propensity and character through conduct\" in closing. Further, Owens complains\nthat the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence by referencing missed mental health\nappointments that were not actually supported by admitted evidence. We address each\ncomplaint in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f       Standard of Review\n\n\n                \"In considering a claim of prosecutorial error, [the court] follow[s] a two-step\n       analysis.

The\nchallenged portion of the State's closing provided:\n\n\n                \"What do we have? We have a guy who his roommates and his mom knows he\n       has a .45. That gun will not be found because it's not at his house. The cops don't know\n       that it's in the lake. They'll never find it, okay. It's not in Manhattan; it's not at his folks'\n       house. He has been told over and over again to stay away from her by her own brother\n       who is a cop. She has cut him off of her social media. He's in the Wichita area the day of\n       the shooting. He is alone. His family is not with him. No one is going to give him an\n       alibi. And we've got Marvin sitting in his driveway, and we'll have pictures that the cops\n       are going to find, because they did, of him going in and going out, and a car consistent\n       with his dad's truck. If I got no statement from him, is that the kind of circumstantial case\n       you would want to look at and give some weight to? He's the ex-boyfriend. He's breaking\n       up. His last words to her the last time they spoke was this whole business about, well, the\n       last girlfriend I had\u2014and tells that whole story. It's irrelevant if that's true. It's just a\n       weird thing to say to a girl you're trying to get back in touch with. 'Well, the last\n       girlfriend I had, I dug a hole for.'\n\n\n\n\n                                                       35\n\f              \"When tragedies happen people want to try to make sense of them.\"\n\n\n      The prosecutor went on:\n\n\n      \"It is not a unique story. He dated a girl. He wanted it to go in a direction she didn't. He's\n      talking marriage after six weeks, eight weeks. When she told him right off the bat,\n      'Brother, this is going to be fun, but I'm heading out of state.' And then told it was over.\n      He doesn't leave it alone. He tells her this crazy story; tells her what happened in war.\n\n\n              \"Her own family, her brother gets involved and says, 'Back off.' She defriends\n      him. He brings his gun from Manhattan. He takes it home and gets it loaded. He gets in\n      his dad's car and he drives to the house. Whether he was driving around or sitting and\n      waiting, okay. A whole lot of time passes while he's thinking about what he's going to do.\n      He could have turned around and headed back to Andover, or Manhattan for that matter.\n      But he chose to stay. He chose to park. He chose to walk up there. And he chose to have\n      that weapon out.\"\n\n\n      Owens claims the State used the \"dug a hole\" comments impermissibly \"to show\npropensity and character through conduct,\" and to \"inflame the passions or prejudices of\njurors.\" But he does not develop these arguments beyond these bare assertions.\n\n\n      To the contrary, the prosecutor's argument illustrated how Rooshad's testimony\n(that Owens told Rowena about the \"dug a hole\" story) controverted Owens' claim that he\nwent to Rowena's home just to talk about getting back together. Based on this testimony,\nthe prosecutor reasonably argued that after Owens told Rowena the \"dug a hole\" story, it\nwas unlikely that Owens was bewildered by Rowena's decision to end the relationship\nand that he entered her home only in search of Rowena's \"legitimate\" explanation for the\nbreakup. We hold that these comments were founded on reasonable inferences from the\nadmitted evidence and within the \"wide latitude\" afforded to prosecutors in closing\nargument. See State v. Longoria, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">301 Kan. 489</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">343 P.3d 1128</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015).\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f        The Prosecutor's Argument Regarding the Missed Medical Appointments\n\n\n        Next, Owens argues that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence in closing\nargument by claiming Owens missed several scheduled mental health appointments and\nreferencing, as support, medical records that were not admitted into evidence. During this\nsection of closing, the State attacked Owens' argument that his PTSD, traumatic brain\ninjury, and mental health issues caused him to accidentally fire the gun. The prosecutor\nsaid:\n\n\n                \"You're going to get all these stacks of records about all the efforts he went\n        through, and the VA was letting him down. And, you know, he's got PTSD and all these\n        things, and he's just not getting the help he wants. For what it's worth, if you want to pore\n        through them, page 120 of the Levine [sic] records, this is in May of '16, so what, just\n        three or four months before the act. 'The patient did not show up for his appointment.\n        This is his fourth consecutive no show.' This is a guy who is crying for help; he sure\n        misses a lot of appointments with his docs. Again, this is a pattern. It goes back to May of\n        '15. 157, I think it is, yeah. 'Patient did not show up for his appointment.'\n\n\n                \"'Patient did not show up for his appointment,' page 158.\n\n\n                \"He no-showed for his new patient appointment, page 177. Does that mean\n        anything? Does that mean he's guilty of murder? No. But as we're trying to\u2014as the\n        defense wants to put all of this into this notion that he's been to war. He's served his\n        country honorably. He came back a different man, and he's not getting the support and\n        help he wants, and that's why he was at this dire, dark place and this accident, this terrible\n        accident happened, well, take a good, hard look at that.\"\n\n\n        The State concedes that \"the medical records in the record on appeal do not\ncontain the page numbers referenced by the prosecutor.\" But the State attempts to smooth\nover the fact that the prosecutor's statements did not match up with the records in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      37\n\fevidence by arguing that the \"fact\" that Owens did not utilize medical help available to\nhim \"was indeed in evidence.\"\n\n\n       The State's argument is unconvincing. The prosecutor plainly argued facts not in\nevidence. The prosecutor said Owens' pattern of declining help \"goes back to May of\n'15.\" None of the record cites the State referenced to support the prosecutor's closing\nargument date back to May of 2015. The only admitted records from Lafene Health\nCenter in 2015 confirm that Owens did attend scheduled appointments, and none offer\nsupport for the prosecutor's argument. And the admitted Veterans Administration records\ndo not reflect any treatment provided or offered to Owens in 2015 at all.\n\n\n       Similarly, none of the record cites submitted by the State in its appellate brief deal\nwith a no-showed \"new patient\" appointment, which the prosecutor also claimed Owens\nmissed. \"[I]t is clearly improper for a prosecutor to state facts that are not in evidence.\"\nState v.

The State contends the prosecutor's error does not warrant reversal of Owens'\nconvictions because any error is harmless. Ultimately, we agree with the State.\n\n\n       The State charged Owens with first-degree premeditated murder or, in the\nalternative, felony murder. Owens used the medical records to bolster his defense that\n\n\n                                                38\n\fOwens did not intend to pull the trigger and shoot Rowena, therefore, suggesting the\nkilling was accidental, not intentional and premeditated. The State's closing argument\nrelied on medical records not in evidence to challenge this defense.\n\n\n       Ultimately, the jury acquitted Owens of first-degree, premeditated murder and\nconvicted him under the alternate theory of felony murder, specifically a killing in the\ncommission of aggravated burglary. Owens' defense\u2014that he did not pull the trigger\nintentionally or with premeditation\u2014was not a legally viable defense to Owens' crime of\nconviction. Whether Owens intentionally pulled the trigger or did so accidentally makes\nno legal difference for purposes of felony murder. The jury did not have to find Owens\nintended to kill Rowena or acted with premeditation to convict him of felony murder; the\njury only had to find Owens killed Rowena while committing aggravated burglary. See\nState v. Mireles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">297 Kan. 339</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">301 P.3d 677</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013) (\"[T]he elements of felony\nmurder do not include a killing that is intentional or done with premeditation.\"). And, as\ndiscussed previously, there is abundant evidence to support the jury's finding that Owens\nkilled Rowena during an aggravated burglary. Therefore, the prosecutorial error was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\nNo Cumulative Error\n\n\n       Owens contends he is entitled to a new trial because of cumulative error. This\ncourt may reverse a defendant's convictions for cumulative error \"when the totality of the\ncircumstances demonstrate that the defendant was substantially prejudiced by cumulative\nerrors and was denied a fair trial.\" State v.

We also held that the State committed prosecutorial error by stating\nfacts not in evidence during its closing argument. But we concluded this error was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\n       The presumed error and harmless prosecutorial error affected separate and distinct\nsubject matter and issues. The errors were not interrelated in a way that enhanced their\nprejudicial force. In other words, the cumulative impact of the errors is no greater than\nthe sum of their individual parts.\n\n                                                    40\n\f       Moreover, the weight of the evidence against Owens was remarkably strong. The\njury heard Owens' confession to shooting Rowena, after he entered her home without\npermission to intimidate her. The State supplemented the confession with substantial\ndirect and circumstantial evidence that convincingly established the elements of felony\nmurder and aggravated burglary. Given the negligible impact of the unrelated errors,\ncoupled with the strength of the State's evidence, we hold that the cumulative effect of\nthe errors was harmless beyond reasonable doubt and did not deny Owens a fair trial. See\nTully, 293 Kan. at 205-07.\n\n\nKansas' Criminal Restitution Scheme Implicates Section 5 of the Kansas Constitution Bill\nof Rights\n\n\n       Finally, Owens argues that Kansas' criminal restitution scheme is unconstitutional.\nUnder that scheme, district court judges must order criminal defendants to pay restitution.\nThis restitution includes, but is not limited to, damage or loss caused by the defendant's\ncrime, as determined by the judge. See K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-6604(b)(1); K.S.A. 2016\nSupp. 21-6607(c)(2). Once the judge orders restitution, the statutory scheme converts the\naward into a civil judgment, which may be enforced the same as any other civil\njudgment. K.S.A. 2016 Supp. 21-6604(b)(2); K.S.A. 60-4301.\n\n\n       Owens argues this statutory scheme violates section 5 of the Kansas Constitution\nBill of Rights, which provides: \"The right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\" He contends\nthis guarantee preserved the common-law right to have juries determine damages in civil\ntort claims. According to Owens, the statutory restitution scheme effectively allows a\njudge, rather than a jury, to determine civil damages, thus implicating section 5. He\ntherefore asks this court to vacate his restitution order.\n\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f       Preservation\n\n\n       Owens admits he did not raise this constitutional challenge before the district\ncourt. Generally, we do not consider constitutional claims for the first time on appeal.\nState v. Daniel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">307 Kan. 428</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">410 P.3d 877</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2018). That said, we agree with Owens\nthat his claim meets one of the discretionary exceptions to this general rule\u2014that\nconsideration of the claim is necessary to serve the ends of justice or prevent the denial of\nfundamental rights. See State v. Dukes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">290 Kan. 485</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630046\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630046/state-v-dukes/\">231 P.3d 558</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010).\n\n\n       Analysis\n\n\n       Determining a statute's constitutionality is a question of law over which we have\nunlimited review. State v. Soto, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">299 Kan. 102</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">322 P.3d 334</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014).\n\n\n       The outcome here is controlled by our decision in Arnett. There, we held that the\ncurrent statutory restitution scheme violates section 5 by converting restitution orders, in\nwhich a judge determines the damages proximately caused by the criminal act, into civil\njudgments, thereby bypassing the traditional function of juries to determine civil\ndamages. Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18. Specifically, Arnett held that K.S.A. 60-\n4301; K.S.A. 60-4302; K.S.A. 60-4303; K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 21-6604(b)(2); and the last\nsentence of K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 22-3424(d)(1) violate section 5. However, we also held\nthat the proper remedy for this constitutional impropriety was to sever the offending\nportions of the statutory scheme rather than vacate every judicially determined restitution\norder. Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18.\n\n\n       Owens is thus correct that the criminal restitution statutory scheme implicates\nsection 5. However, once the unconstitutional provisions of that scheme are severed,\nOwens' original restitution judgment is constitutionally firm. He will not be subject to a\ncivil judgment for his criminal restitution unless it is obtained separately through a civil\n\n\n                                             42\n\fcause of action. See Arnett, 314 Kan. at ___, slip op. at 18. Thus, we affirm the district\ncourt's restitution order.\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n       DARYL D.

Lawson, murdered four\npeople: Stacey Holston, her eight-year-old son D.H., her mother, Tammie McGuire,\nand her mother\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire. On October 13, Lawson surrendered\nto police and confessed to the murders.\n        {\u00b6 3} The Lawrence County grand jury returned an 11-count indictment,\nincluding four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications.\nLawson entered guilty pleas to all counts and specifications of the indictment.\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.06, a three-judge panel of the common pleas court heard the\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nstate\u2019s evidence of guilt with regard to the capital charges. The panel found Lawson\nguilty of four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications as to\neach count. The panel then conducted a sentencing hearing and sentenced Lawson\nto death for each aggravated murder.\n       {\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Lawson raises five propositions of law. We overrule\neach of the propositions of law. After conducting an independent review, we\nconclude that although significant mitigating factors exist, the aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\nof the four aggravated murders. We further conclude that each death sentence is\nappropriate and proportionate. Therefore, we affirm all four death sentences.\n                 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                     A. Facts\n       {\u00b6 5} Arron Lawson was Stacey Holston\u2019s first cousin. Stacey lived with\nher husband, Todd Holston, and their sons, D.H. and two-year-old B.H., near Pedro,\nOhio. Lawson lived nearby and was in the habit of visiting the Holstons daily.\n       {\u00b6 6} Lawson was infatuated with Stacey; he told his mother that she was\n\u201cthe love of his life.\u201d In his confession, he stated that he and Stacey had been\nhaving a sexual affair, which Stacey had broken off \u201c[a]bout a week ago,\u201d i.e.,\napproximately October 6, 2017.\n       {\u00b6 7} Lawson visited Stacey on Tuesday, October 10, 2017, the day before\nthe murders, while Todd was at work. During this visit, Lawson surreptitiously\nentered a bedroom at the back of the house, opened a window, and inserted a book\nbetween the window and the sill to hold the window partly open. By his own later\nadmission, he did this with the intention of entering the house the next day to\ncommit murder.\n       {\u00b6 8} At about 7:15 p.m., when Todd came home, Lawson was still there\nwith Stacey and the children. At Stacey\u2019s request, Todd drove Lawson home. Todd\ntestified at trial that Lawson \u201cwasn\u2019t too happy about\u201d being sent home.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The next morning, Todd left for work at approximately 4:30 a.m.\nAbout half an hour later, Lawson entered the Holstons\u2019 residence through the rear\nwindow. He had a 20-gauge shotgun, eight shells loaded with slugs, and a backpack\ncontaining flashlights, toilet paper, knives, a tarp, and other items. Lawson hid in\nthe back bedroom until about 8:30 a.m.\n       {\u00b6 10} Meanwhile, D.H.\u2019s school bus arrived and D.H. left the house to go\nto school. Stacey sent with him a note directing the school to put D.H. on a different\nbus that afternoon than he normally rode and to take him to his grandparents\u2019 house.\n       {\u00b6 11} By 8:30, after D.H. had left, Stacey was in the home with B.H.\nStacey entered the back bedroom where Lawson was hiding, and Lawson shot her\nthree times in the chest and shoulder. She fell to the floor.\n       {\u00b6 12} Lawson dragged her body to D.H.\u2019s bedroom where he lifted her\nonto a futon bed and, using a condom, had sex with her corpse. Lawson discarded\nthe condom in the kitchen wastebasket. He then returned to the bedroom and\ncovered Stacey\u2019s body with a blanket and the futon\u2019s mattress.\n       {\u00b6 13} As these events were occurring, Todd was at a worksite in Maysville,\nKentucky, where he clocked in at 6:43 a.m. It was Stacey\u2019s habit to send Todd a\ntext message early every morning to make sure he had arrived safely at work. When\nshe failed to do so on October 11, Todd began to worry. He repeatedly tried to call\nand text her throughout the day, but she did not respond.\n       {\u00b6 14} At 9:23 a.m., Lawson used Stacey\u2019s cell phone to call D.H.\u2019s school.\nPosing as Todd, Lawson told the school\u2019s guidance secretary that D.H.\u2019s\ngrandfather was unable to watch D.H. that day, so D.H. should be taken home on\nhis usual bus that afternoon. Lawson spoke calmly and gave the guidance secretary\nno reason to doubt he was who he claimed to be. Because Lawson was using\nStacey\u2019s phone, the phone number on the school\u2019s caller ID matched the number\non file in the office. So the original arrangement was canceled and D.H. was\nbrought home after school. Meanwhile, Lawson waited at the Holstons\u2019 residence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nHe fed B.H., changed his diaper, and later put him down for a nap in the main\nbedroom.\n        {\u00b6 15} When D.H. arrived home, Lawson sat with him in the living room\nand they talked about school. However, D.H. began asking Lawson where his\nmother was and when his father was coming home. Lacking answers, Lawson told\nD.H. that Lawson\u2019s PlayStation 3 was in D.H.\u2019s room behind the dresser. D.H.\nwent to his bedroom. As D.H. looked behind his dresser, Lawson shot him twice,\nonce in the arm and once in the torso. Lawson left the boy\u2019s body where it fell and\ncovered it with clothes. After killing D.H., Lawson continued to wait in the\nHolstons\u2019 residence.\n        {\u00b6 16} Around 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., Todd tried again to contact Stacey on his\nway home from his worksite. He then called Stacey\u2019s mother, Tammie McGuire,\nwho lived about a quarter mile from the Holstons. Tammie agreed to check on\nStacey and drove to the house. A few minutes later, she called Todd back and told\nhim that she was at his house but that the door was locked. Todd authorized her to\nbreak in, and she did. The phone connection remained open. A few minutes later,\nTodd heard Tammie scream, \u201cOh, my God\u201d followed by a loud noise. Then, as\nTodd later testified, \u201call of a sudden it was just quiet.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 17} By Lawson\u2019s account, he was in the main bedroom when he heard\nTammie forcing her way into the house. He hid behind the bedroom door; when\nTammie opened that door, he stepped out and shot her. Lawson dragged Tammie\u2019s\nbody to the laundry area and threw a blanket over her. He then used her keys to\nmove her truck behind the house.\n        {\u00b6 18} Meanwhile, Todd phoned Tammie\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire, and\napprised him of the situation. Donald said he would go and check, and he walked\nto the house.\n        {\u00b6 19} According to Lawson, Donald initially tried to enter through the\nback door, but it was locked, so Donald went around to the locked front door and\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u201crammed through.\u201d When Donald came in, Lawson shot him and dragged the body\nto D.H.\u2019s bedroom.\n        {\u00b6 20} About 10 to 20 minutes later, Todd arrived home. When he came\nthrough the front door, Lawson attacked him with a knife, stabbing him a number\nof times in the head, neck, and torso. Todd wrested the knife from Lawson and\npinned him to the couch.\n        {\u00b6 21} Todd asked Lawson why he had attacked him.            According to\nLawson, he then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a blind thing of anger.\u201d But\nTodd testified that Lawson had said, \u201cThere\u2019s been people breaking in out here, and\nI thought you was one of them.\u201d According to Todd, Lawson then \u201cshook like he\nsnapped out of something.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 22} Todd also asked Lawson where Stacey and the children were.\nLawson said they were in the bedroom and were \u201cokay.\u201d Todd testified that he\nthen forcefully removed Lawson from the house. Lawson drove away in the truck\nbelonging to the McGuires.\n        {\u00b6 23} Todd checked on B.H., who was unharmed. (According to Lawson,\nB.H. slept through at least the first three murders.) Todd then looked through the\nhouse. After finding the bodies of Tammie, Stacey, and Donald, he took B.H. and\ndrove to the McGuires\u2019 house, where he borrowed a cell phone from Tammie\u2019s\nbrother and called 9-1-1.\n        {\u00b6 24} Lawson had planned to hide out in the woods, but he had left his\nbackpack and shotgun behind in the Holstons\u2019 house, so he drove to a store. With\ncash stolen from the Holstons, he bought new clothes to replace his bloodstained\nones.\n        {\u00b6 25} While driving the truck, Lawson was pursued by police; he\nabandoned the truck and fled on foot. Eventually, he reached a wooded area, where\nhe spent the next two nights. Lawson later said that after one \u201ccold, cold night\u201d in\nthe woods, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have no more flight in me.\u201d Nevertheless, he did not\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemerge from the woods until the morning of October 13, when he was apprehended.\nDetectives took him to the county prosecutor\u2019s office in Ironton, where he\nconfessed to the four murders.\n       {\u00b6 26} Dr. Robert Shott, the deputy Montgomery County coroner,\nperformed autopsies on all four victims. He testified that Stacey suffered two\nshotgun wounds to the chest and one to the back, fatally injuring her heart and\nlungs. D.H. was shot twice, receiving fatal wounds to the heart, lung, and aorta.\nTammie was shot once in the neck, fatally injuring her spinal cord, and once in the\nshoulder. Donald was shot once in the shoulder and once, fatally, in the chest.\n                              B. Procedural History\n       {\u00b6 27} On October 18, 2017, the grand jury indicted Lawson on four counts\nof aggravated murder with death specifications. Count 1 charged the aggravated\nmurder of Stacey Holston with prior calculation and design, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A).      Count 1 carried three death specifications: course of conduct\ninvolving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(5); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7),\npredicated on rape.\n       {\u00b6 28} Count 2 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of D.H., a child\nunder the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(C). This count carried six death\nspecifications: course of conduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder of a\nvictim younger than 13, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9); murder to escape\ndetection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated\non kidnapping; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Count 3 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Tammie\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Count 4 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Donald\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Counts 3 and 4 both carried four death specifications: a course of\nconduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n       {\u00b6 30} The indictment also included the following noncapital counts: Count\n5, attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.02(A); Count 6,\nfelonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Count 7, aggravated burglary,\nin violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2); Count 8, rape, in violation of R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2); Count 9, abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B); Count\n10, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Count 11, tampering with\nevidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1); Count 12, theft of a motor vehicle, in\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(5); and Count 13, failure to comply with\na police officer\u2019s order, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii). Counts\n1 through 4 and Counts 7, 8, and 10 carried firearm specifications.\n       {\u00b6 31} On February 21, 2019, the state voluntarily dismissed the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8) specifications that were attached to Counts 2, 3, and 4. Lawson then\nentered pleas of guilty to all remaining counts and specifications before the three-\njudge panel. Over the next few days, the three-judge panel heard witness testimony\nas required by R.C. 2945.06 and on February 25, 2019, unanimously found Lawson\nguilty of all counts of the indictment except Count 8 (rape) and of all specifications\nexcept the specification for felony murder predicated on rape that was attached to\nCount 1 (aggravated murder of Stacey).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The panel then held a mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C.\n2929.03(D)(1) beginning on February 26, 2019. After hearing the evidence that\nLawson offered in mitigation, the panel sentenced him to death on all four counts\nof aggravated murder. He also received sentences totaling 59 years and six months\non the noncapital counts and specifications. Lawson appeals of right and we now\naddress his propositions of law.\n      II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY\n                                     HEARING\n       {\u00b6 33} Lawson initially pleaded not guilty to the indictment. More than a\nyear later, he changed his mind, waived a jury trial, and entered guilty pleas to each\ncount of the indictment and to all the death specifications (except the three that the\nstate voluntarily dismissed). In so doing, he acted against his trial counsel\u2019s advice.\n       {\u00b6 34} Defense counsel never requested a hearing into Lawson\u2019s\ncompetence to stand trial. Nevertheless, in his first proposition of law, Lawson\ncontends that the trial court had a constitutional duty to inquire into his competence\nto stand trial before accepting his change of plea.\n                                 A. Relevant Facts\n       {\u00b6 35} On February 11, 2019, several days into the jury-selection process,\ndefense counsel informed the trial court that Lawson did not want a trial. In\nchambers, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys explained that Lawson did not want to put\nhimself, his family, and the families of the victims through a full trial \u201cwith all of\nthe gruesome photos that would be presented [and] all of the things that would be\n* * * said about him.\u201d Counsel said that he had explained to Lawson that if he\nentered a guilty plea, the case would proceed before a three-judge panel, not a jury.\n       {\u00b6 36} Defense counsel then observed:\n\n\n       I suppose * * * if he wants to do that, there\u2019s always a question of\n       whether or not there needs to be an examination of his competence\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        to waive jury in a capital case. Obviously that\u2019s not something that\n        we can [determine] today. And it may be something that would\n        require a psychological evaluation, although in a capital case, I\n        would ask for an independent one rather than what we would do in\n        a typical case.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 37} One of the prosecutors noted that the defense team included a\npsychologist, Dr. Bob Stinson, and asked whether Dr. Stinson could render an\nopinion on Lawson\u2019s competence. Defense counsel replied that he could not\n\u201ccommit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that,\u201d because a competency assessment is\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d from a mitigation assessment.        Nevertheless, defense\ncounsel noted that Dr. Stinson \u201c[o]bviously * * * would have more familiarity with\n[Lawson] than anyone else\u201d and stated that he \u201cassume[d] that it could be done in\na manner\u201d; he also stated that he had not \u201cthought through whether that would\ncreate some sort of a conflict in terms of what [Dr. Stinson\u2019s] testimony would be\nin the mitigation phase.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 38} The trial judge then stated that he had \u201cbrought this up months ago\non the potential for a competency evaluation\u201d but that he had declined to order one\nbecause the defense had opposed it. (Any previous discussions of competency\nissues must have occurred off the record, as the transcript does not reflect any\ndiscussion of a competency evaluation before February 11.) The trial judge\ncontinued, \u201cI\u2019m now second-guessing myself that I should have [ordered] it over\nobjection.\u201d       Defense counsel remarked that the court was \u201cnot incorrect\u201d in\ndeclining to order an evaluation over the defense\u2019s opposition. The prosecutor\npointed out that the defense had not raised a question about Lawson\u2019s competence\nto stand trial.\n        {\u00b6 39} At the request of defense counsel, the court took a recess so that\nLawson could discuss the matter with his family. When the session resumed,\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefense counsel told the court at a bench conference that \u201cafter much thought,\nconsideration, [and] discussion with family members and counsel,\u201d Lawson had\ndecided not to change his plea and would proceed with a jury trial. The court then\nresumed the jury-selection process and the prospective jurors were brought into the\ncourtroom.\n       {\u00b6 40} The next day, however, Lawson\u2019s counsel informed the trial court\nthat Lawson had decided to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea\nto a three-judge panel. The trial court questioned Lawson at length about whether\nhe understood that he was waiving his constitutional right to have a jury hear and\ndecide the case. Lawson affirmatively stated a number of times that he understood\nthe consequences of his decision.\n       {\u00b6 41} During this exchange, the trial court asked Lawson whether he had\nconsulted with his family about his decision.          Lawson answered that after\nconsulting with his family the previous day, he \u201chad a second thought throughout\nthe night.\u201d He informed the trial court that \u201cit was a little rough because I saw my\nmom crying and it always plays on my heart. And then after a while I have to make\na better decision for my life and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 42} The trial court accepted Lawson\u2019s waiver. Lawson\u2019s counsel then\nfiled a written waiver of jury trial that Lawson had signed. Defense counsel\ncertified in writing that they had consulted with Lawson, had explained his right to\na jury trial, and believed that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\nThe trial court\u2019s acceptance of Lawson\u2019s jury waiver was also filed; it included the\ntrial court\u2019s finding that the waiver was made \u201cknowingly, intelligently and\nvoluntarily.\u201d On February 19, 2019, the chief justice of this court assigned two\nadditional judges to serve on the three-judge panel.\n       {\u00b6 43} On February 21, 2019, the panel held a change-of-plea hearing. At\nthe hearing, defense counsel stated that they had discussed the change of plea with\nLawson for about 90 minutes that day. Prior to proceeding to consider the change\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nof plea, the presiding judge asked counsel whether at any point they ever had any\nconcerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency * * * that\nwould have prevented him from knowingly and intelligently and voluntarily\nentering into th[e] plea waiver\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that based on\nhis many years of experience with representing incompetent clients, his interactions\nwith Lawson gave him \u201cno reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of\nthose categories.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 44} The presiding judge then asked whether defense counsel had\n\u201cconducted appropriate investigation * * * into * * * mental issues or competency\nissues.\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that with Dr. Stinson\u2019s assistance, they\nhad conducted such an investigation. After lengthy discussions with Dr. Stinson,\nthe attorney said, the defense had elected not to raise the issue of \u201cpossible\nincompetency to proceed in this matter.\u201d\n            B. The Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire Into Competence\n  1. Historical perspective on the prohibition against the trial of incompetent\n                                     defendants\n       {\u00b6 45} The fundamental principle that a criminal defendant who has been\nadjudicated to be legally incompetent shall not be required to stand trial has deep\nroots in common law. See Freeman v. People, 4 Denio 9, 1847 WL 4116, *19\n(N.Y.1847) (recognizing that new competency legislation \u201cwas not introductory\u201d\nas it was \u201cin strict conformity with the common law on the subject\u201d). The\nprohibition against the trial of incompetent defendants \u201cdates back at least to the\ntime of [Sir William] Blackstone.\u201d Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct.\n2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), fn. 11. In the eighteenth century, Blackstone wrote\nthat if a man commits an offense and becomes \u201cmad\u201d after the commission of the\noffense, then he should not be arraigned for it \u201cbecause he is not able to plead to it\nwith that advice and caution that he ought.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\non the Laws of England, 24. Similarly, if he becomes \u201cmad\u201d after pleading, he\nshould not be tried, \u201cfor how can he make his defense?\u201d Id.\n       {\u00b6 46} The Supreme Court has long held that convicting a defendant while\nhe is legally incompetent violates the United States Constitution. \u201c[T]he conviction\nof an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process, and * * *\nstate procedures must be adequate to protect this right.\u201d Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S.\n375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), citing Bishop v. United States, 350\nU.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835 (1956).\n       {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2945.37, which was first enacted in 1978, see Am.Sub.H.B. No.\n565, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2937, 2943-2946, sets forth the process that a\ndefendant is due when an issue is raised pertaining to his competency. R.C.\n2945.37(B) states:\n\n\n               In a criminal action * * *, the court, prosecutor, or defense\n       may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. If\n       the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\n       hold a hearing on the issue * * *. If the issue is raised after the trial\n       has commenced, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for\n       good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion.\n\n\n               2. What Triggers a Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire?\n       {\u00b6 48} A defendant is rebuttably presumed to be competent to stand trial.\nState v. Barton, 108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 56, citing\nR.C. 2945.37(G). \u201c[A] competency determination is necessary only when a court\nhas reason to doubt the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 401, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, fn. 13.\n       {\u00b6 49} Over 60 years ago, the now well-known test for determining legal\ncompetency to stand trial was announced in Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402,\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960).           Agreeing with the solicitor general\u2019s\nargument, the Supreme Court explained that a trial court must inquire into whether\nthe defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a\nreasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well\nas factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Id. at 402. This standard\nalso applies when a court is determining a defendant\u2019s competency to plead guilty\nor waive his right to counsel. Godinez at 396, 398-399.\n       {\u00b6 50} We first recognized the Dusky competency test in State v. Chapin,\n67 Ohio St.2d 437, 439-440, 424 N.E.2d 317 (1981), and have continued to apply\nit in the ensuing decades, see State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-\n5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 56 (stating that the Dusky test applies when assessing a\ndefendant\u2019s competency to enter a guilty plea).\n       {\u00b6 51} Due process requires a court to hold a hearing when it has been\npresented with a \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence.\u201d Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S.\n162, 175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). When the issue of competency is\nraised after a defendant\u2019s trial has commenced, R.C. 2945.37(B) directs that \u201cthe\ncourt shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s\nown motion.\u201d We have construed the connotation of the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d to be\n\u201cin accordance with the general principles set forth [by the Supreme Court] in\nDrope and Pate[,383 U.S. at 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815].\u201d State v. Berry,\n72 Ohio St.3d 354, 360, 650 N.E.2d 433 (1995), citing Chapin. Therefore, \u201c[t]he\nright to a hearing on the issue of competency rises to the level of a constitutional\nguarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence\u2019 such that\nan inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s\nright to a fair trial.\u201d Berry at 359, quoting Drope at 175.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                     3. Analysis\n      a. Were there sufficient indicia of incompetence to require a hearing?\n       {\u00b6 52} Lawson acknowledges that his counsel never asked for a\ncompetency evaluation, but he contends that the trial court denied him due process\nby not ordering one sua sponte. He contends that the record in this case establishes\nsufficient \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d to require a hearing.\n       {\u00b6 53} Three facts, Lawson contends, called his competence into question.\nFirst, his decision to waive a jury trial and plead guilty to the indictment was made\nagainst the advice of his counsel. Second, he displayed \u201cindecision,\u201d in that he\nchanged his mind about pleading guilty. Third, at the time of his plea, he \u201cwas\nbeing treated with psychiatric medications,\u201d a fact he disclosed to the trial court\nduring the plea colloquy.\n       {\u00b6 54} Lawson\u2019s acting against the advice of counsel does not indicate\nincompetence. We have noted that a defendant\u2019s \u201crefusal to heed his counsel\u2019s\nadvice * * * [does] not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the\ncharges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in\nhis defense.\u201d State v. Johnson, 112 Ohio St.3d 210, 858 N.E.2d 1144, 2006-Ohio-\n6404, \u00b6 161. Indeed, such a refusal generally \u201cevidences [the defendant\u2019s] ability\nto participate in his defense.\u201d State v. Fletcher 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 49814, 1985\nWL 4215, *2 (Dec. 5, 1985).\n       {\u00b6 55} Nor does Lawson\u2019s alleged indecision suggest that he was\nincompetent. The record shows that after first expressing his desire to plead guilty\non February 11, 2019, Lawson discussed the matter with his counsel and family\nand then decided not to change his plea. The next day, however, he filed his written\njury waiver. The record does not show that he changed his mind again. On\nFebruary 21, he still wished to plead guilty, and he did so without further hesitation.\n       {\u00b6 56} It is not surprising that a defendant contemplating entering a guilty\nplea in a capital case would display some hesitation. \u201cIndecisiveness is not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsame as incompetency[,] however.\u201d Johnson v. State, 138 Md.App. 539, 567, 772\nA.2d 1260 (2001). And Lawson\u2019s indecision does not amount to irrationality. See\nUnited States v. Miller, 531 F.3d 340, 348 (6th Cir.2008) (in determining\ncompetency, a court is to consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior).\nLawson explained that he changed his mind due to the emotional toll he felt when,\nduring a visit, his mom cried to him about his actions. However, once he distanced\nhimself from those emotions and further reflected, he knew that the best decision\nfor him was to change his not-guilty plea to a plea of guilty.\n       {\u00b6 57} In any event, Lawson\u2019s change of mind was brief. Having decided\nto plead guilty on February 12, he held to his decision in the face of his counsel\u2019s\ncontrary advice and after a rigorous plea colloquy. And he continued to hold to his\ndecision over the ensuing nine days and during the change-of-plea hearing before\nthe three-judge panel. This sequence of events has no tendency to show that\nLawson lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding, nor does it suggest that he was unable to understand the\nproceedings.\n       {\u00b6 58} Finally, Lawson cites his statement during the plea colloquy that he\nwas taking prescription medication. The presiding judge asked Lawson whether he\nwas \u201cpresently under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or mind-altering\nsubstance.\u201d Lawson replied: \u201cI\u2019m under prescription medication, but that is all.\u201d\nHe stated that he was taking naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and Zoloft.\n       {\u00b6 59} However, \u201cit is a matter of statutory and decisional law that \u2018[t]he\nfact that a defendant is taking antidepressant medication or prescribed psychotropic\ndrugs does not negate his competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio\nSt.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 56, quoting State v. Ketterer, 111\nOhio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 71; see also State v. Mink, 101\nOhio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 38; R.C. 2945.37(F) (\u201cThe\ncourt shall not find a defendant incompetent to stand trial solely * * * because the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant is receiving or has received psychotropic drugs or other medication, even\nif the defendant might become incompetent to stand trial without the drugs or\nmedication\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 60} In both Mink and Ketterer, as Lawson points out, \u201ccompetency\nevaluations were conducted * * * before each defendant entered his guilty plea to\ncapital charges.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 54, citing Mink at \u00b6 31-32 and Ketterer at \u00b6 67.\nNevertheless, Mink and Ketterer do not stand for the proposition \u201cthat a court must\norder a competency hearing before accepting a guilty plea from a capital defendant\nwho is taking a prescription medication for mental illness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)\nMontgomery at \u00b6 54. And in Montgomery, we expressly declined to so hold. Id.\n       {\u00b6 61} Lawson stated during the colloquy that his medications did not\nprevent him from understanding what his attorneys or the court said to him, nor did\nthey affect his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court\nalso asked Lawson if there was any medication that he had been prescribed but was\nnot taking; he said no. Moreover, during the plea colloquy, Lawson \u201cappropriately\nanswered the court\u2019s questions,\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 57, and displayed no\n\u201coutrageous, irrational or confused\u201d behavior, id. at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 62} The presiding judge asked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen\nany indication that Lawson\u2019s medications \u201ccould be affecting his ability to reason\nor [his] judgment.\u201d Both attorneys replied in the negative. \u201cSolemn declarations\nin open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S.\n63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Lawson\u2019s counsel knew that Lawson\nwas taking medication, \u201cyet they had no concerns about his competence.\u201d\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 51. The\nrecord contains no countervailing evidence\u2014nothing to suggest that the\nmedications Lawson was taking could have hampered his ability to understand the\nproceedings or assist his counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 63} Finally, after Lawson informed the court that he was taking\nprescription medication, the trial court conducted a full plea colloquy under\nCrim.R. 11. The panel asked Lawson whether he understood the constitutional\nrights he was waiving by pleading guilty, the consequences of his pleading guilty,\nand the maximum sentence he could potentially receive if found guilty of the capital\nspecifications. The panel had previously verified that he understood the written\nplea of guilty and had executed it with the assistance of his counsel. The panel\nasked Lawson whether he understood each of the charges against him. Lawson\n\u201canswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent\nfashion.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 50.\n       {\u00b6 64} Trial counsel\u2019s statements to the trial court are also important in\nconsidering whether the trial court violated Lawson\u2019s due-process rights by failing\nto initiate a competency hearing. \u201cTrial counsel\u2019s assurances to the court are\nrelevant because \u2018a defendant\u2019s counsel is in the best position to evaluate a client\u2019s\ncomprehension of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Stanley v. Cullen, 633 F.3d 852, 861 (9th\nCir.2011), quoting Hernandez v. Ylst, 930 F.2d 714, 718 (9th Cir.1991). The\nSupreme Court has recognized that \u201cjudges must depend to some extent on counsel\nto bring issues into focus.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 176-77, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103. Lawson\u2019s defense counsel never asserted their belief that Lawson was\nincompetent. In fact, lead defense counsel stated just the opposite.         Counsel\nindicated that the trial court was correct in declining to order a competency\nevaluation. He told the court that he had spent \u201cmany hours\u201d with Lawson over a\n17-month period and had discussed Lawson\u2019s competence with Dr. Stinson, and\nlead defense counsel expressly stated that he had \u201cno reason to think\u201d that Lawson\nwas incompetent to enter a guilty plea. \u201c[W]hen a trial court must decide whether\nto hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, reviewing courts\n\u2018give weight * * * to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the defendant.\u2019 \u201d State\nv. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298 (1999), quoting Commonwealth\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nv. Hall, 15 Mass.App. 1, 3, 443 N.E.2d 121 (1982). In this case, the presiding judge\nhad observed Lawson\u2019s in-court demeanor for months and was able to observe his\ndemeanor during the plea colloquy. Indeed, \u201cit is noteworthy that nobody on the\nspot thought [Lawson\u2019s] behavior raised any question as to his competence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Cowans at 84; accord State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-\nOhio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 63; Montgomery at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 65} Under all the circumstances here, the facts that Lawson cites as\nindicia of incompetence were insufficient to overcome the general presumption of\ncompetence and were insufficient to entitle him to a competency evaluation.\n               b. Did the trial court raise the issue of competency?\n       {\u00b6 66} Lawson contends that \u201cthe [trial] court itself effectively raised the\nissue\u201d of his competence\u2014presumably on February 11, 2019, when the court\nwondered out loud whether it should have ordered a competency hearing earlier in\nthe case over the defense\u2019s objections. Lawson relies on State v. Bock, 28 Ohio\nSt.3d 108, 110, 502 N.E.2d 1016 (1986), in which this court stated: \u201c[T]here is no\nquestion that where the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is raised\nprior to the trial, a competency hearing is mandatory.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.37(B).\nLawson\u2019s argument is not clear, but he seems to imply that a competency hearing\nwas required under Bock because the trial court itself had \u201craised\u201d the issue of\ncompetence.\n       {\u00b6 67} We disagree. While a trial court may raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency, see R.C. 2945.37(B), the trial court in this case was not exercising this\nauthority. In essence, the trial court was asking the defense whether it wanted a\ncompetency hearing. Asking the defense whether it wants a hearing does not by\nitself make a hearing mandatory. The fact that the trial court did not order a\ncompetency evaluation and hearing, when it had the authority to sua sponte do so,\nshows that the court did not intend to raise the issue of Lawson\u2019s competence.\nMoreover, even if a competency hearing were mandatory under Bock, the failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nhold one would be harmless error in this case: \u201c[I]t is clear that the failure to hold\na mandatory competency hearing is harmless error where the record fails to reveal\nsufficient indicia of incompetency.\u201d Bock at 110.\n                    4. No support for the dissent\u2019s per se rule\n        {\u00b6 68} As set forth above, the Supreme Court has established, and Ohio has\nadopted, specific procedures to adequately protect an incompetent defendant from\nbeing tried or convicted. The dissent, however, advocates for the adoption of a per\nse rule\u2014that a competency examination and hearing are required at the instant in\nwhich a capital defendant pursues an adverse-interest request, such as entering a\nplea of guilty.\n        {\u00b6 69} There is no compelling reason to adopt that per se rule. As the Fifth\nCircuit has held:\n\n\n        [W]e decline to adopt a per se rule that, as a matter of law, a trial\n        court must doubt a capital punishment defendant\u2019s competency, or\n        conclude that such defendant does not understand the proceedings\n        against him or appreciate their significance, or conclude that he\n        cannot rationally aid his attorney in his defense simply because it is\n        obvious to the court that the defendant is causing his trial to be\n        conducted in a manner most likely to result in a conviction and the\n        imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\nRoberts v. Dretke, 381 F.3d 491, 498 (5th Cir.2004).\n        {\u00b6 70} A per se rule is also incongruous with the Supreme Court\u2019s position\nthat there is no one sign that triggers the need for a competency evaluation.\n\n\n        [E]vidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at\n        trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but\n       that even one of these factors standing alone may, in some\n       circumstances, be sufficient. There are, of course, no fixed or\n       immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further\n       inquiry to determine fitness to proceed; the question is often a\n       difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle\n       nuances are implicated.        That they are difficult to evaluate is\n       suggested by the varying opinions trained psychiatrists can entertain\n       on the same facts.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) Drope, 420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103.\n       {\u00b6 71} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Lawson\u2019s first proposition of\nlaw.\n III. VALIDITY OF LAWSON\u2019S JURY WAIVER AND GUILTY PLEAS\n       {\u00b6 72} In his second proposition of law, Lawson contends that both his jury\nwaiver and his subsequent guilty pleas were invalid because they were not knowing,\nvoluntary, and intelligent. This proposition essentially restates the claims made in\nhis first proposition of law; the same three circumstances that the first proposition\ncalls \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d are here relied upon as reasons to question the\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent character of his jury waiver and guilty pleas.\nLawson also argues that before accepting his waiver and pleas, the trial court should\nhave advised him that a single juror could prevent a death sentence. For the reasons\nthat follow, we reject both claims.\n                               A. The Jury Waiver\n       {\u00b6 73} \u201cIn addition to determining that a defendant who seeks to plead\nguilty * * * is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself that the waiver of his\nconstitutional rights is knowing and voluntary.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 400, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321. The United States Supreme Court has explained the\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\ndistinction between a competency determination and an inquiry into the knowing\nand voluntary character of a rights waiver as follows:\n\n\n               The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant\u2019s mental\n       capacity; the question is whether he has the ability to understand the\n       proceedings. * * * The purpose of the \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d\n       inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actually\n       does understand the significance and consequences of a particular\n       decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 401, fn. 12, quoting Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 28, 113\nS.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).\n       {\u00b6 74} A jury waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. E.g.,\nState v. Ruppert, 54 Ohio St.2d 263, 271, 375 N.E.2d 1250 (1978). Waiver may\nnot be presumed from a silent record; however, if the record shows that a jury\nwaiver occurred, the verdict will not be set aside except on a plain showing that the\nwaiver was not freely and intelligently made. Adams v. United States ex rel.\nMcCann, 317 U.S. 269, 281, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). Moreover, a\nwritten waiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. United States\nv. Sammons, 918 F.2d 592, 597 (6th Cir.1990). See generally State v. Bays, 87\nOhio St.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126 (1999).\n       {\u00b6 75} In this case, Lawson executed and filed a written jury waiver.\nAttached to the waiver was the following certification by defense counsel:\n\n\n               We, the undersigned, as counsel for defendant Arron\n       Lawson, have consulted with our client, explained his Constitutional\n       rights to a trial by jury, and made inquiry to determine if his decision\n       * * * was based upon any promises or coercive tactics * * * and\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        explained to him the process of trial by three-judge panel. We find\n        no evidence of any promises or coercive tactics * * *. We recognize\n        that his waiver of jury trial is voluntary. And we believe his waiver\n        is knowingly and intelligently made.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 76} By itself, the fact that a defendant is taking prescription medications\n\u201cdoes not defeat the presumption that his written waiver was knowing, intelligent,\nand voluntary.\u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d\n180, at \u00b6 30. Lawson points to nothing to show \u201cthat he, in fact, failed to understand\nthe waiver proceedings or the effect of his decision to waive\u2014or that his decision\nwas somehow involuntary\u2014because of the prescription medications.\u201d Id.\n                                B. The Guilty Pleas\n        {\u00b6 77} \u201cPrior to accepting a guilty plea from a criminal defendant, the trial\ncourt must inform the defendant that he is waiving his privilege against compulsory\nself-incrimination, his right to jury trial, his right to confront his accusers, and his\nright of compulsory process of witnesses.\u201d State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473,\n423 N.E.2d 115 (1981), paragraph one of the syllabus, following Boykin v.\nAlabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242-243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); see also\nCrim.R. 11(C)(2)(c).\n        {\u00b6 78} In this case, the trial court complied with Ballard and Crim.R.\n11(C)(2)(c) by informing Lawson that his guilty plea waived his rights to confront\nthe state\u2019s witnesses, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to require the state\nto prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial in which he would have had the\nright not to testify against himself.\n        {\u00b6 79} Lawson initiated the decision to plead guilty, \u201cinsisted upon it\nagainst advice of counsel, and held to it through a lengthy plea colloquy,\u201d State v.\nFitzpatrick, 102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 40. In\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nFitzpatrick, this court concluded on similar facts that it was \u201cclear\u201d that a capital\ndefendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was voluntary. Id.\n        {\u00b6 80} Nevertheless, Lawson contends that his plea was not voluntary,\nknowing, and intelligent, because (1) the trial court did not inquire into why he was\nnot following counsel\u2019s advice, (2) the trial court did not inquire more deeply into\nthe nature and effects of the medications Lawson was taking, and (3) the trial court\naccepted the waiver and pleas without a hearing on Lawson\u2019s competence.\n        {\u00b6 81} Lawson argues that when a defendant chooses, contrary to his\ncounsel\u2019s advice, to waive a jury trial or plead guilty, the trial court has a duty to\ninquire into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s decision. But he cites no authority for\nthat position.\n        {\u00b6 82} The decisions whether to waive a jury trial and whether to plead\nguilty belong to the defendant, not counsel. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745,\n751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). A defendant\u2019s election to exercise his\nright to reject his counsel\u2019s advice does not imply that his decision could not have\nbeen knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. To draw such an inference would negate\nthe defendant\u2019s right to decide these matters for himself.\n        {\u00b6 83} Lawson also asserts that his decision to reject counsel\u2019s advice was\n\u201cessentially\u201d equivalent to waiving the right to counsel altogether. We reject this\nassertion; there is an obvious difference between Lawson\u2019s situation\u2014having the\nassistance of counsel, but rejecting counsel\u2019s advice\u2014and having no counsel at all.\n        {\u00b6 84} Lawson also argues that the trial court failed to conduct a sufficient\ninquiry into the prescription drugs he was taking. He contends that the trial court\nshould have asked what the medications were for, who prescribed them, how long\nLawson had been taking them, when he had taken them last, and what effects they\nmay have had on his mental state.\n        {\u00b6 85} Lawson cites Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, at \u00b6 66, in which this court stated: \u201cAdditional inquiry is necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ninto a defendant\u2019s mental state once a defendant seeking to enter a guilty plea has\nstated that he is under the influence of drugs or medication.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 86} However, in Montgomery, we rejected a similar claim on similar\nfacts. The defendant in Montgomery argued that the three-judge panel inadequately\ninquired \u201cinto the effect, if any, that his prescription medications had on his mental\nstate.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 44.\n        {\u00b6 87} When the presiding judge in Montgomery learned at the jury-waiver\nhearing that the defendant was taking prescription medications for mental illness,\nthe judge asked \u201cwhether he had been prescribed the medications and whether he\nwas taking them pursuant to the prescription.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49. The judge also \u201cdirectly\nasked him whether he understood the constitutional rights he was forgoing by\nwaiving his right to a jury, whether he was doing so voluntarily, and whether his\ncounsel had reviewed the jury waiver with him prior to the hearing.\u201d Id. The panel\nlater conducted a plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and \u201cMontgomery\nanswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion.\u201d\nId. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 88} Moreover, \u201c[t]he panel had no reason to believe that Montgomery\nhad any issues with competence or could not intelligently and voluntarily enter a\nguilty plea.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47. Neither the defendant nor counsel in Montgomery \u201cever\nmade any representation to the court that he had any * * * issues with competency.\u201d\nId. The panel specifically asked at the plea hearing\n\n\n        whether [defense counsel] had any reason to believe that\n        [Montgomery] was not competent or capable of voluntarily and\n        intelligently pleading guilty. Defense counsel * * * were aware that\n        Montgomery was medicated for depression, yet they * * * never\n        raised an issue to the court about Montgomery\u2019s ability to\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        understand the proceedings and enter a knowing and voluntary\n        guilty plea.\n\n\nId. at \u00b6 51.\n        {\u00b6 89} In the end, \u201cthere [was] no evidence * * * that Montgomery was not\nin full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point during the\npendency of his case.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180,\nat \u00b6 52. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cthe panel\u2019s inquiry into Montgomery\u2019s\nmental state and use of prescription medications and in its acceptance of\nMontgomery\u2019s guilty plea was adequate and that Montgomery voluntarily and\nknowingly pleaded guilty to capital murder.\u201d Id.\n        {\u00b6 90} The facts of this case closely parallel those of Montgomery. During\nthe plea colloquy, the trial court asked Lawson whether his medications prevented\nhim from understanding what his attorneys or the court told him and whether they\naffected his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court also\nasked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen any indication that Lawson\u2019s\nmedications were affecting his reasoning ability or judgment. Neither Lawson nor\nhis counsel indicated at any point \u201cthat he had any * * * issues with competency,\u201d\nMontgomery at \u00b6 47. Moreover, as in Montgomery, the panel in this case conducted\na plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and Lawson \u201canswered each of the\npanel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion,\u201d id. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 91} \u201cIn short, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that [Lawson]\nwas not in full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point\nduring the pendency of his case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52. \u201c[C]onsidering the totality of the\nevidence,\u201d id., the panel\u2019s inquiry into Lawson\u2019s mental state and use of\nprescription medications was sufficient to comply with Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350,\n2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n      C. Failure to Advise that Single Juror Can Block Death Sentence\n        {\u00b6 92} Lawson contends that his jury waiver and guilty pleas were not\nvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent because the trial court did not tell him that a\nsingle juror can block a death sentence. However, we have rejected that contention.\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 30, citing\nBays, 87 Ohio St.3d at 19-21, 716 N.E.2d 1126; see also Fitzpatrick, 102 Ohio\nSt.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 NE.2d 927, at \u00b6 42-48; Sowell v. Bradshaw, 372\nF.3d 821, 833 (6th Cir.2004). We reject it again today.\n              III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        {\u00b6 93} In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance. To establish ineffective assistance, Lawson must\nshow (1) deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective\nstandard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been\ndifferent. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052,\n80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989),\nparagraphs two and three of the syllabus.\n                A. Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation\n        {\u00b6 94} Lawson argues that his counsel should have requested a competency\nevaluation, which would have led to a competency hearing.\n        {\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.37(B) entitles the defense to a pretrial competency\nhearing upon request: \u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas, * * * the\ncourt, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to\nstand trial. If the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\nhold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense\ncounsel is not ineffective in failing to request that the trial court order a competency\nevaluation or hold a competency hearing when the defendant does not display\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. State v.\nThomas, 97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 96} Lawson contends that counsel\u2019s decision not to request a\ncompetency evaluation cannot be justified as a strategic decision, because\nrequesting an evaluation would have had no possible \u201cdownside.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 97} Lawson\u2019s assertion that there is no downside to requesting a\ncompetency evaluation in this type of situation is questionable: defense counsel\nmay risk straining their relationship with their client when they question his mental\ncompetence and seek to negate his decisions. But in any event, competent counsel\nwould not request an evaluation unless they had some reason to doubt the\ndefendant\u2019s competence. Here, nothing in the record shows that Lawson\u2019s counsel\nhad any such reason.\n       {\u00b6 98} Lawson contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate the\ncompetency issue before declining to request a competency evaluation. He argues\nthat an expert opinion on Lawson\u2019s competence was essential, because counsel\u2019s\n\u201carmchair opinions\u201d were not a sufficient basis on which to make such a decision.\nHe further argues that the record fails to show that defense counsel ever sought an\nexpert opinion.\n       {\u00b6 99} Lawson points to defense counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court on\nFebruary 11, 2019, the day Lawson first announced that he wanted to waive a jury\nand plead guilty. One of the prosecutors asked whether Dr. Stinson could render\nan opinion on competence based on conversations Dr. Stinson and Lawson had\nalready had. One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied:\n\n\n               I can\u2019t commit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that. I know\n       psychologists that I have worked with in the past would probably\n       say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a completely different review and assessment,\u201d\n       and they\u2019re looking for different things than the context of\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       presenting possible psychological information for purposes of\n       mitigation.\n               Obviously [Dr. Stinson] would have more familiarity with\n       this young man than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be\n       done in a manner, although I * * * haven\u2019t thought through whether\n       that would create some sort of a conflict in terms of what his\n       testimony would be in the mitigation phase.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Lawson reads this statement as indicating \u201cthe limited scope of Dr.\nStinson\u2019s services[,] which did not include a competency examination.\u201d But\ndefense counsel did not say that Dr. Stinson could not render such an assessment.\nHe said only that he could not guarantee that Dr. Stinson would be able to form an\nopinion of Lawson\u2019s competence based on the interviewing Dr. Stinson had done\nup to that point. Indeed, counsel went on to say that Dr. Stinson \u201cwould have more\nfamiliarity with [Lawson] than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be done\nin a manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n       {\u00b6 101} Lawson goes on to assert that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that\nindicates that Dr. Stinson or any other mental health professional did, or was even\nasked to do, a competency evaluation on\u201d Lawson. Lawson\u2019s argument misplaces\nthe burden of persuasion: a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal must show from the record that the elements of the claim\nexist. Therefore, Lawson must show that his counsel failed to perform an adequate\ninvestigation of his possible incompetence. See, e.g., State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d\n448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 244.\n       {\u00b6 102} Lawson also ignores what defense counsel said during the plea\nhearing on February 21. During that hearing, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys expressly\nstated that counsel had conducted an investigation into competency issues and that\nthey had consulted Dr. Stinson:\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n               JUDGE BALLARD: * * * [A]t any point did you ever have\n       any concerns that might be raised by Adkins [sic, Atkins v. Virginia,\n       536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002)], or any\n       mental defect or mental deficiency that could have been identified\n       in Mr. Lawson that would have prevented him from knowingly and\n       intelligently and voluntarily entering into this plea waiver?\n               MR. MCVAY [defense counsel]: Not being a psychologist\n       or a psychiatrist * * * I\u2019m not in a position * * * to technically\n       answer that. But based on my many years of experience and 24\n       years as a practicing attorney handling a substantial number of death\n       penalty cases * * * and having had clients who would be Adkins-\n       qualified or otherwise incompetent to enter a plea, * * * I have no\n       reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of those\n       categories at this point in time based upon my discussions with him\n       and many hours spent with him, over 17 months, as well as the time\n       spent with him today.\n\n\n(Capitalization sic.)\n       {\u00b6 103} The presiding judge then asked counsel: \u201c[I]s it safe for this panel\nto assume that you conducted appropriate investigation from your practice into any\nissue that would be addressed by Adkins or mental issues or competency issues?\u201d\nCounsel replied:\n\n\n               We did, your Honor. In keeping with the American Bar\n       Association Guidelines for the Representation of Defendants\n       Charged with Capital Crimes and their recommendation, if not\n       insistence, that we engage a forensic psychologist to work with and\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       examine the defendant in the course of our representation, * * * that\n       in fact has been done. * * *\n               Having said that, and having discussed matters with * * *\n       Dr. Stinson at length, I think I can fairly represent that by virtue of\n       the fact that we have not filed any pleadings pertaining to a possible\n       incompetency to proceed in this matter * * *, I feel that we\u2019re on\n       safe ground in that respect in the sense that we have done our due\n       diligence with regard to that * * *. We have looked into all of those\n       matters, discussed most, * * * I would suggest all of those matters\n       with Mr. Lawson. I believe that we\u2019re on solid ground to move\n       forward with what his intentions are at this point in time.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) This statement indicates that Dr. Stinson examined Lawson and\nthat defense counsel consulted Dr. Stinson in determining whether to further pursue\nthe issue of Lawson\u2019s competence. Lawson cites nothing in the record that either\ncontradicts counsel\u2019s representations or shows that the investigation that had been\nconducted was deficient.\n       {\u00b6 104} Finally, Lawson is unable to show prejudice resulting from\ncounsel\u2019s declining to request a competency evaluation. It is true that if Lawson\u2019s\ncounsel had requested an evaluation, the trial court would have been required by\nstatute to order one.   But that says nothing about the likely outcome of the\nevaluation and of the hearing. To show prejudice, Lawson must show that there is\na reasonable probability that an evaluation \u201cwould have revealed that he was\nincompetent to stand trial,\u201d Alexander v. Dugger, 841 F.2d 371, 375 (11th\nCir.1988).\n       {\u00b6 105} As we concluded in relation to Lawson\u2019s first proposition of law,\nthe record simply contains insufficient indicia of incompetence to require a\ncompetency evaluation or a competency hearing. If defense counsel had requested\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\na competency evaluation, the trial court would have had to hold a hearing. But the\nalleged indicia of incompetence that Lawson repeatedly cites would have been\ninsufficient to overcome the legal presumption of competence, because they do not\nsuggest that Lawson was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the\nproceedings against him or of assisting in his own defense. The record of the\npenalty phase contains numerous references to Lawson\u2019s mental-health history,\nincluding diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, and posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). However, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere\nmental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be\nemotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the\ncharges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 110, 502\nN.E.2d 1016. Accordingly, the record does not show a reasonable likelihood that\nthe trial court would have found Lawson incompetent to stand trial.\n              B. Failure to Argue Mercy As a Mitigating Factor\n       {\u00b6 106} In another part of his third proposition of law, Lawson contends\nthat his counsel were ineffective because they failed to renew a pretrial motion to\ninstruct the jury on mercy as a mitigating factor and because they did not argue\nduring the penalty phase that mercy was a mitigating factor.\n       {\u00b6 107} As the state points out, any issues concerning jury instructions\nbecame moot once Lawson waived a jury trial. However, Lawson also contends\nthat counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue before the three-\njudge panel that mercy is a mitigating factor. That facet of his claim is obviously\nnot rendered moot by Lawson\u2019s jury waiver.\n       {\u00b6 108} However, the claim lacks merit, as we have repeatedly held that\nmercy is not a mitigating factor. See, e.g., State v. Belton, 149 Ohio St.3d 165,\n2016-Ohio-1581, 74 N.E.3d 319, \u00b6 88; State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-\nOhio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955, \u00b6 253. Hence, counsel did not perform deficiently by\ndeclining to argue otherwise.     \u201cDefense counsel is not required to advance\n\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\narguments lacking merit. * * * It is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to\nmaneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested or rejected legal\ntheories.\u201d State v. McNeill, 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 449, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998).\n       {\u00b6 109} Lawson also fails to show prejudice. Defense counsel in this case\npresented extensive mitigating evidence focused on Lawson\u2019s dysfunctional family\nand upbringing, his alleged abuse, traumatic events in his life, and his diagnosed\nmental disorders. Their penalty-phase arguments to the panel concentrated on that\nevidence. Lawson does not explain how adding an express plea for mercy would\nhave been reasonably likely to make a difference in the penalty-phase outcome.\n       {\u00b6 110} We overrule Lawson\u2019s third proposition of law.\n                          V. SENTENCING OPINION\n       {\u00b6 111} In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the\npanel\u2019s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends\nthat the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against\nhim and improperly discounted the mitigating factors. We disagree.\n                 A. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s 12-page sentencing opinion begins with a\nstatement of facts. According to Lawson, the opinion includes several facts that\n\u201cmade the crime particularly disturbing\u201d and could only \u201cbe termed as\ninflammatory.\u201d Lawson contends that by mentioning these facts in the opinion, the\npanel \u201cemployed\u201d them as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\n       {\u00b6 113} The \u201cinflammatory\u201d facts Lawson refers to include the following:\nthat Lawson had sexual intercourse with Stacey\u2019s body after shooting her, that\nStacey had recently ended a sexual relationship with Lawson, that Lawson posed\nas D.H.\u2019s father to deceive D.H.\u2019s school into sending him home that day, that\nLawson \u201ctricked\u201d D.H. into entering the bedroom and shot him twice at close range,\nthat Lawson prepared in advance for the murders by propping a window open the\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nnight before, that he moved and covered the bodies, and that he was arrested two\ndays later \u201c[a]fter a manhunt.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 114} But a trial court does not \u201ccreate nonstatutory aggravating\ncircumstances\u201d merely by \u201cdiscussing the facts of the crime.\u201d State v. Robb, 88\nOhio St.3d 59, 82, 723 N.E.2d 1019 (2000). Moreover, the sentencing opinion here\ncorrectly identified the aggravating circumstances of which Lawson was found\nguilty as to each aggravated-murder count. When a trial court has correctly\nidentified the statutory aggravating circumstances pleaded and proved at trial, we\npresume that the trial court understood the difference between statutory aggravating\ncircumstances and the facts that describe the nature and circumstances of the\noffense. State v. Martin, 151 Ohio St.3d 470, 2017-Ohio-7556, 90 N.E.3d 857,\n\u00b6 137.\n         {\u00b6 115} Lawson points to nothing in the opinion that suggests that the panel\nused the facts as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Instead, he contends that\nthe opinion fails to affirmatively state that the facts were not so used, and he argues\nthat this failure suffices to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only\nthe aggravating circumstances to which Lawson pleaded guilty. However, the\nopinion does specifically state that the panel did not consider Lawson\u2019s alleged\naffair with Stacey or the other \u201coffenses charged in the indictment,\u201d which would\ninclude his abuse of Stacey\u2019s corpse, as aggravating circumstances.\n         {\u00b6 116} Lawson\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our precedent.             The\nopinion \u201cidentified only the applicable statutory aggravating circumstances * * *\nand listed no improper nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.              Therefore,\n[Lawson] has not rebutted the presumption that the court relied only upon the\naggravating circumstances it identified.\u201d State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio St.3d 175,\n2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, \u00b6 121.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n            B. Unconsidered or Improperly Discounted Mitigation\n        {\u00b6 117} Lawson also contends that the panel\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201ccontains\nweighing errors\u201d that violate the Eighth Amendment as construed in Lockett v.\nOhio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion),\nand Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The\nUnited States Supreme Court in Eddings held that the sentencer in a capital case\nmay not \u201crefuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 114. Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider\nsome mitigating factors and gave too little weight to others.\n        {\u00b6 118} Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider Dr. Stinson\u2019s\ntestimony bearing on the mitigating factor of Lawson\u2019s youth, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\nBecause Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the murders, the trial court\ngave little weight to this factor. However, the sentencing opinion does not discuss\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony that the human brain does not finish developing until a\nperson reaches his mid-20s; in particular, Dr. Stinson testified that this is true of the\nfrontal lobe, which is responsible for \u201cjudgment, reasoning, impulse control, [and]\nplanning.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s opinion does not discuss this testimony,\nLawson asks us to infer that the panel did not consider it.\n        {\u00b6 119} But \u201c[w]hile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of\nmitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio\nSt.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). A trial court\u2019s failure to discuss each\nmitigating factor in its opinion does not give rise to an automatic inference that\nfactors that were not discussed in the opinion were not considered. Obermiller, 147\nOhio St.3d 175, 2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, at \u00b6 125, citing State v. Roberts,\n137 Ohio St.3d 230, 2013-Ohio-4580, 998 N.E.2d 1100, \u00b6 54.\n        {\u00b6 120} Such an inference is warranted only in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d\nRoberts at \u00b6 64, and Lawson points to no such circumstances here. In Roberts, the\ndefendant\u2019s allocution contained \u201cpotentially significant mitigation,\u201d id., and \u201cwas\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthe only relevant matter * * * specifically placed before the trial court as\nmitigation\u201d (emphasis sic), id. at \u00b6 56; in those circumstances, the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to mention the allocution in the sentencing opinion warranted the inference\nthat the court had failed to consider the allocution.       But in this case, as in\nObermiller, the sentencing opinion \u201cdiscussed multiple mitigating factors,\u201d\nObermiller at \u00b6 126. Therefore, the inference that the trial court failed to consider\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony is not justified.\n       {\u00b6 121} Lawson also contends that the trial court erred by \u201cunreasonably\ndiscount[ing]\u201d or giving \u201cinsufficient consideration to\u201d his mitigating evidence\ngoing to various other factors\u2014i.e., assigning it no weight or insufficient weight.\nLawson contends that a trial court violates the holding in Eddings and the Eighth\nAmendment by assigning insufficient weight to a defendant\u2019s mitigation.\n       {\u00b6 122} As we have explained, this reading of Eddings is incorrect because,\nas stated in Harris v. Alabama, 513 U.S. 504, 512, 115 S.Ct. 1031, 130 L.Ed.2d\n1004 (1995), \u201cthe Constitution does not require a State to ascribe any specific\nweight to particular factors, either in aggravation or mitigation, to be considered by\nthe sentencer.\u201d The weight to be given to any mitigating factor is \u201c \u2018an individual\ndecision by the fact finder,\u2019 \u201d not a matter of law. State v. Davis, 139 Ohio St.3d\n122, 2014-Ohio-1615, 9 N.E.3d 1031, \u00b6 62, quoting State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d\n353, 369-370, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992), abrogated in part on other grounds, see\nState v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 402-403, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997).\n       {\u00b6 123} Quoting Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 42, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175\nL.Ed.2d 398 (2009), Lawson describes it as a case in which the United States\nSupreme Court held that a state supreme court \u201c \u2018either did not consider or\nunreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence\u2019 adduced in a post-conviction\nhearing.\u201d   But \u201cPorter does not stand for the proposition that the Eighth\nAmendment forbids a sentencer to \u2018discount\u2019 mitigating evidence introduced at the\npenalty phase of the trial.\u201d Davis at \u00b6 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Therefore, we overrule Lawson\u2019s fourth proposition of law.\n                             VI. SETTLED ISSUES\n       {\u00b6 125} Lawson\u2019s fifth proposition of law raises various oft-rejected\narguments against the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes\ngoverning its imposition and also raises similar arguments that the death penalty\nviolates international law. See, e.g., State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-\nOhio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 106, 109-120; State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164,\n169-174, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984). We summarily overrule this proposition of law.\nSee generally State v. Poindexter, 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568 (1988),\nsyllabus; State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 81, 521 N.E.2d 800 (1988).\n                 VII. INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW\n       {\u00b6 126} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Lawson\u2019s\ndeath sentences. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine (1) whether the\nevidence supports the trier of fact\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, (2)\nwhether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty\noutweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) whether the\ndeath sentences are proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.\n                        A. Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 127} The aggravated murder of Stacey Holston (Count 1) has two\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)), and a felony-\nmurder circumstance predicated on aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)).\n       {\u00b6 128} The aggravated murder of D.H. (Count 2) has five aggravating\ncircumstances: murder of a victim under age 13 (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)); murder\ncommitted to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another\noffense (R.C 2929.04(A)(3)); course of conduct; felony murder predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder predicated on kidnapping.\n       {\u00b6 129} The aggravated murder of Tammie McGuire (Count 3) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 130} The aggravated murder of Donald McGuire (Count 4) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 131} The evidence in the record, including Lawson\u2019s confession,\nsupports the panel\u2019s finding as to each of the aggravating circumstances.\n                              B. Mitigating Factors\n       {\u00b6 132} Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh any of the\nrelevant mitigating factors provided in R.C. 2929.04(B). These factors include\n\u2022      the nature and circumstances of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      the history, character, and background of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it, R.C.\n       2929.04(B)(1),\n\u2022      whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for\n       the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation,\n       R.C. 2929.04(B)(2),\n\u2022      whether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a\n       mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the\n       criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct\n       to the requirements of the law, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3),\n\u2022      the youth of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4),\n\u2022      the offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and\n       delinquency adjudications, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5),\n\u2022      if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\n       the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim,\n          R.C. 2929.04(B)(6),\n\u2022         and any other factors that are relevant to the issue whether the offender\n          should be sentenced to death, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\n                                         1. Age\n          {\u00b6 133} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), \u201c[t]he youth of the offender\u201d is a\nmitigating factor. Lawson was born in 1994 and was 23 years old when he\ncommitted these murders. Lawson\u2019s age \u201cqualifies as a mitigating factor under\nR.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\u201d State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842\nN.E.2d 996, \u00b6 195.\n          {\u00b6 134} In the penalty phase, Lawson presented testimony from Dr.\nStinson, a forensic psychologist.       Dr. Stinson testified that the human brain\ncontinues to develop until a person reaches his mid-20s. He specifically noted that\nthe frontal lobe\u2014which is responsible for things like judgment, reasoning, impulse\ncontrol, and planning\u2014is the last part of the brain to develop and does not reach\nfull development until the mid-20s.\n                                2. Prior Criminal History\n          {\u00b6 135} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), \u201c[t]he offender\u2019s lack of a significant\nhistory of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications\u201d is a mitigating\nfactor.    The trial court found that Lawson has no previous convictions or\ndelinquency adjudications.\n                             3. Mental Disease or Defect\n          {\u00b6 136} The diminished-capacity mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), is\ninapplicable. Although Lawson has been diagnosed with various mental disorders,\nincluding bipolar disorder, Dr. Stinson did not testify that any of them deprived him\nof \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform\n[his] conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). The other\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nmitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B) that are not addressed in this opinion\nare likewise inapplicable.\n                     4. History, Character, and Background\n       {\u00b6 137} Lawson\u2019s history, character, and background constituted the heart\nof his case in mitigation. In the penalty phase, Lawson presented three witnesses:\nCarolyn Taylor, Stephanie Bentley, and Dr. Stinson. Carolyn Taylor is Lawson\u2019s\nmother. Stephanie Bentley is his half-sister and Carolyn\u2019s daughter. Dr. Stinson\ninterviewed Lawson for a total of 12 hours during four sessions and also\ninterviewed Lawson\u2019s mother. He reviewed information obtained by a mitigation\nspecialist who had conducted interviews of Lawson, his mother, his stepmother\nMartha Lawson, his half-sisters Stephanie Bentley and Summer Riesner, and others\nfamiliar with Lawson and his family. Dr. Stinson reviewed children\u2019s services,\neducational, employment, medical, mental-health, and jail records pertaining to\nLawson, records pertaining to Carolyn Taylor\u2019s family background and upbringing,\nand other records.\n       {\u00b6 138} Dr. Stinson identified 11 \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d\n(\u201cACEs\u201d) that place a child at risk for adverse health, mental-health, and social\noutcomes. They are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical\nneglect, emotional neglect, \u201cintimate partner violence,\u201d violence against the\nmother, \u201csubstance misuse in the household,\u201d parental divorce or separation,\nmental illness of a household member, and the incarceration of a household\nmember. Dr. Stinson testified that a research study conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention found that ACEs relate to approximately 40\nnegative outcomes. The presence of four or five ACEs indicates \u201csignificantly\nincreased risk for negative outcomes,\u201d and the likelihood of negative outcomes\nrises with the number of ACEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 139} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson had experienced \u201cat least\u201d nine\nACEs. The only two Dr. Stinson failed to definitively find were sexual abuse and\nphysical neglect.\n         {\u00b6 140} Lawson was born in April 1994. His parents are Delbert \u201cRay\u201d\nLawson and Carolyn Taylor. He was the third of five children Carolyn had by five\ndifferent men. Both of Lawson\u2019s parents have been divorced and remarried\nmultiple times. Carolyn has lived on welfare, food stamps, and Social Security\ndisability benefits.\n         {\u00b6 141} Ray and Carolyn lived together for about a month; when Carolyn\nbecame pregnant with Lawson, Ray left her. Carolyn lost custody of Lawson in\n1995. Ray denied his paternity until a DNA test proved that he was Lawson\u2019s\nfather; after that, he sought and was awarded custody of Lawson. According to Dr.\nStinson, Martha Lawson recalled that Carolyn had dropped Lawson off at Ray and\nMartha\u2019s house coatless in the middle of a winter night with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nturn.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 142} Lawson lived with Ray and Martha until he was 16. Also living in\nthe Lawson household were Ray and Martha\u2019s son Ray Jr. and Martha\u2019s son James\nMunyon. Carolyn was entitled to visitation with Lawson on Wednesdays and\nalternate weekends.    However, she testified that sometimes Ray and Martha\ndeprived Lawson of a visit as a punishment.\n         {\u00b6 143} While living with Ray and Martha, Lawson was especially close to\nhis paternal aunt, Linda McFann. Carolyn testified that Linda was \u201clike a second\nmom\u201d to him. Unfortunately, Linda died in a house fire. Carolyn testified that\nLawson was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Linda\u2019s death. Dr. Stinson testified that Linda died\nin 2006, when Lawson was about 12 years old. According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson\nstill had not \u201cresolved\u201d his bereavement five years later. At that time, a neighbor\ntold Lawson that he was glad Linda was dead, and Lawson responded by\n\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthreatening the neighbor with a butcher knife. Lawson was hospitalized at a\nmental-health facility after this incident.\n        {\u00b6 144} Lawson was also quite close to the boyfriend of one of his aunts,\nwhom he called \u201cUncle Tracy.\u201d Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Tracy was the most\npositive influence in his life. But Tracy died of a heroin overdose in about 2016.\n        {\u00b6 145} When Lawson was 16, Ray and Martha divorced, and Ray moved\nto Kentucky, leaving his children behind. Custody of Lawson then reverted to\nCarolyn, who had married Carl Kelly. A few months later, Carolyn and Kelly broke\nup, but Lawson continued to live with Kelly, whom Bentley described as like a\nfather to Lawson. Dr. Stinson believed that Kelly was generally a positive influence\non Lawson and may have provided \u201csome positive role modeling.\u201d On the other\nhand, Bentley testified that Kelly sold a lot of marijuana and provided some of it to\nLawson. After moving out, Carolyn maintained contact with Lawson, seeing him\nevery few days and talking to him on the phone.\n        {\u00b6 146} Dr. Stinson described the \u201ccomplicated family structure\u201d within\nwhich Lawson was raised. Ray left Lawson\u2019s mother to marry Martha, and\nLawson\u2019s mother had a relationship with Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon, who was\nthe father of Lawson\u2019s half-sister Stephanie Bentley. Lawson was teased in school\nbecause of this \u201cweird\u201d family situation. Additionally, Lawson\u2019s grandfather\nfathered a child with one of his daughters-in-law (Lawson\u2019s aunt by marriage); that\nchild was referred to as Lawson\u2019s \u201cUncle Cuz\u201d because he was both uncle and\ncousin to Lawson.\n        {\u00b6 147} Since at least age 11, Lawson has repeatedly alleged that his father,\nstepmother, and other family members abused him. He described his father as an\n\u201cabusive asshole\u201d who would get drunk and punch him.\n        {\u00b6 148} Carolyn testified that during visitations, she sometimes saw\nunexplained injuries on Lawson. Once she saw stitches in his head. She said that\nsomeone once squeezed Lawson\u2019s ears so tightly that they were severely bruised\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand had turned black. Bentley remembered seeing this as well, but she never saw\nany other bruising or injures. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Martha would pinch his\nears to the point of bruising and would strike him in the face.\n       {\u00b6 149} On one occasion, Carolyn testified, a dark orange substance was\ndraining from Lawson\u2019s ear. Carolyn recalled that when she took Lawson to a\ndoctor to treat his ear, the doctor said that it looked as if someone had jabbed the\nmetal end of a pencil into Lawson\u2019s ear after removing the eraser.\n       {\u00b6 150} Dr. Stinson testified that according to the medical records he\nreviewed, there were two cases of drainage from Lawson\u2019s ears. The first instance\nof \u201cbloody drainage\u201d occurred when Lawson was three; almost a year later, Lawson\nexperienced the orange discharge that had been described by Carolyn from the same\near.   According to Dr. Stinson, medical records documented that Lawson\u2019s\nstepbrother, James Munyon, had shoved pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears; however, Dr.\nStinson did not make clear whether this behavior had caused the discharges.\n       {\u00b6 151} Dr. Stinson admitted that to his knowledge, no specific instances of\nabuse against Lawson had ever been substantiated. And although Dr. Stinson\nbelieved that Lawson was a victim of abuse, he eventually conceded that he did not\nknow whether Lawson had been abused. (Dr. Stinson did not classify the alleged\ninsertion of pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears as a type of \u201cabuse.\u201d)\n       {\u00b6 152} Dr. Stinson also testified that Lawson reported abuse \u201cover and\nover and over to people who did nothing.\u201d Dr. Stinson felt that the fact that\nLawson\u2019s claims went unheeded was actually \u201cmore relevant\u201d than whether he\nactually was abused, because it contributed to his feelings of being unloved:\n\n\n       We can look back on it and say \u201cWell, it * * * really wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n       From my standpoint what\u2019s more relevant is the fact that once he\n       reported his abuse, nobody did anything about it * * * and he\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       internalized [the belief that] nobody cares, nobody\u2019s going to protect\n       me, nobody loves me and I\u2019m unlovable.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 153} Lawson did tell his mother that he was being abused, and his\nmedical records showed that he reported past abuse to medical-health professionals\nduring his treatment sessions.\n       {\u00b6 154} However, when Lawson first alleged to authorities that he was\nbeing abused, the authorities did not ignore it; they investigated and found no\nevidence to support the claim. The penalty-phase evidence includes records for\nLawson and his family from the Lawrence County Department of Job and Family\nServices that were admitted as a court\u2019s exhibit. Those records include a children\u2019s\nservices report showing that Ray and Martha were investigated in 2006 after\nLawson reported to the Ironton police that he was being abused.\n       {\u00b6 155} According to the records, Lawson alleged that his stepmother\nslapped his face, his siblings \u201cput erasers in his ears,\u201d and his parents \u201chit him\neverywhere.\u201d But the investigator found only one small bruise on Lawson\u2019s knee,\nand that appeared to the investigator to be normal for a preteen child and to not\nhave been deliberately inflicted.\n       {\u00b6 156} The investigator learned that Lawson\u2019s father had recently spanked\nhim with a belt; however, the spanking was inflicted as a punishment after Lawson\nchoked his brother, Ray Jr., during a squabble. Martha told the investigator that\nLawson had expressed a desire \u201cto get his father in trouble like he was in trouble\nfrom choking\u201d his brother.\n       {\u00b6 157} Although Lawson has never reported that he was sexually abused\nand in fact has denied it, Dr. Stinson nonetheless suspected that Lawson may have\nbeen sexually abused as a child. He based this suspicion on the existence of\n\u201crampant\u201d sexual abuse in Lawson\u2019s family over the years. Carolyn\u2019s oldest son\nwas allegedly sexually abused and went on to abuse two sisters and a cousin.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLawson\u2019s stepbrother was sexually abused by a neighbor. One of Lawson\u2019s half-\nsisters was sexually abused by Carolyn\u2019s brother-in-law. A generation before,\nCarolyn\u2019s family members had been involved in numerous allegations of sexual\nabuse. Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson may have denied being sexually abused\nbecause it was so common as to become \u201cnormalized\u201d in his family.\n       {\u00b6 158} Lawson\u2019s mother, Carolyn Taylor, was raised in poverty; her\nfamily was dependent on welfare and food stamps, and the children were\nmalnourished. Carolyn grew up in a trailer that housed 12 people. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that \u201cthere were concerns that the boys and the girls were sharing bedrooms\nand sleeping together.\u201d The home was leaky and roach-infested and had no indoor\nbathroom.\n       {\u00b6 159} During Carolyn\u2019s childhood, numerous allegations of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were leveled against her parents and stepparents;\nmany of them were against her father in particular.             Children\u2019s services\ninvestigators were able to substantiate some of these allegations, but according to\nDr. Stinson, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, Dr. Stinson\ntestified that the \u201cremarkable\u201d number of allegations said a great deal about the\nculture of Carolyn\u2019s family.\n       {\u00b6 160} Dr. Stinson also stated that Carolyn suffered from \u201csignificant\nmental health problems.\u201d Documented symptoms he listed included agitation,\nanhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities), anxiety, crying spells,\ndisorganized thought, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, homicidal and\nsuicidal thoughts, hyperactivity, paranoia, panic attacks, phobic avoidance,\npreoccupation, self-mutilation, and feelings of worthlessness.          Her \u201cmood\ndisturbance\u201d manifested itself in the forms of severe depression, anger, euphoria,\nirritability, mania, and \u201cmixed moods,\u201d i.e., simultaneous symptoms of depression\nand mania.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 161} Dr. Stinson related that Carolyn had been diagnosed with anxiety\ndisorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, \u201cmoderate and recurrent\u201d major depressive\ndisorder, various forms of bipolar disorder including \u201cmixed [simultaneously manic\nand depressive] severe, with psychotic features,\u201d and schizoaffective disorder, a\npsychotic disorder combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She had been\ntreated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. Carolyn\u2019s\ndoctor had determined that her mental disorders left her \u201cfunctionally impaired,\u201d\nunable to carry on day-to-day activities. The Social Security Administration had\nfound that she was \u201cpermanently impaired and unable to engage in any gainful\nactivity.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 162} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson also had three relatives\u2014an\nuncle, aunt, and great-uncle\u2014who had attempted suicide. And Lawson described\na maternal half-brother as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and as having delusions. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that severe mental-health problems have a genetic component, so that the\nchildren of parents with severe mental-health problems are particularly at risk to\ninherit them.\n        {\u00b6 163} Lawson has in fact had mental-health problems and has been\ndiagnosed with mental disorders since childhood. Most significantly, in March\n2011, shortly before he turned 17, Lawson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and\nbipolar disorder. In April of that year, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at\nMercy Franciscan Hospital after a violent incident with his neighbor. Hospital staff\nmembers believed that past abuse had contributed to his emotional difficulties.\n        {\u00b6 164} Lawson continued to receive mental-health evaluations and\ntreatment in 2011 and 2012. During one psychiatric examination, he said he was\nhaving flashbacks to past abuse. In 2012, Lawson was hospitalized again because\nhe was contemplating injuring his neighbor.\n        {\u00b6 165} Since 2011, Lawson has been diagnosed repeatedly with depressive\ndisorder and PTSD. Dr. Stinson testified that when he interviewed Lawson, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nexhibited classic symptoms of depression and PTSD.                 Despite previous\nhospitalizations, Dr. Stinson testified, Lawson did not receive the kind of treatment\nhe needed.\n        {\u00b6 166} Lawson has had anger issues dating back to his childhood. During\nthe 2006 children\u2019s services investigation, the investigating social worker wrote\nthat she was concerned about Lawson\u2019s inability to control his anger. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that Lawson was enrolled in an anger-management class at age 13 because\nhe was unable to regulate his emotions; however, his stepmother removed him\nbecause the class took time away from his chores and homework. At age 16, he\nwas diagnosed with \u201canger disorder.\u201d Dr. Stinson noted that \u201cthere is no such thing\nas anger disorder,\u201d but he interpreted this diagnosis to mean that Lawson had a\nmood disorder in which anger was predominant.\n        {\u00b6 167} A consistent factor in Lawson\u2019s personality has been his repeatedly\nexpressed feelings that he was worthless; he described himself to Dr. Stinson as\nfeeling like \u201cjust a piece of crap\u201d and \u201clike a dog.\u201d Schoolmates made fun of his\nfamily and his first name. (His mother meant to name him \u201cAaron,\u201d but she\nmisspelled it as \u201cArron\u201d on his birth certificate. His preferred pronunciation is \u201cAr-\nron,\u201d with the emphasis on the second syllable, but people frequently mispronounce\nit.)   Bentley testified that Martha favored her own children over Lawson.\nAccording to Dr. Stinson, Lawson used marijuana to deal with feelings of\nemptiness and worthlessness.\n        {\u00b6 168} Lawson\u2019s family has an extensive history of drug and alcohol\nproblems. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that his father, Ray, was \u201cdrunk all the time.\u201d\nBentley testified that Ray drank \u201c[e]very day, all day long.\u201d Carolyn told Dr.\nStinson that Ray was \u201ca real bad drunk.\u201d During the period when Lawson lived\nwith Ray and Martha, Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon was released from prison and\nmoved into the household. Dr. Stinson testified that Munyon not only smoked\nmarijuana but traded it for sex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Despite Lawson\u2019s family history, Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson\nhimself did not have \u201csevere drug and alcohol problems.\u201d But Dr. Stinson stated\nthat Lawson did use marijuana and other drugs to cope with physical pain and\nemotional distress. Bentley testified that Lawson smoked marijuana frequently or\ndaily. Dr. Stinson diagnosed Lawson with a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d but he\nconceded that this disorder caused no major impairment of Lawson\u2019s functioning.\nThere was no evidence that Lawson had been using alcohol or drugs at the time of\nthe aggravated murders in this case.\n       {\u00b6 170} Lawson had numerous medical problems throughout his life.\nWhen he was two, a dog bit him on the cheek, although Carolyn testified that the\ninjury was not serious. At the age of three, he had a laceration to the forehead,\nrequiring stitches, and had skin-cancer surgery. At the age of four, his tongue was\nclipped twice to correct a speech impediment. Both the skin-cancer surgery and\nthe tongue clipping were outpatient procedures. At the age of 12, while playing\nwith his siblings, he was shot in one eye with an \u201cairsoft\u201d gun (similar to a BB gun,\nbut firing plastic or rubber pellets), causing temporary blindness in that eye. Dr.\nStinson testified that Lawson has continued to have \u201cvision problems\u201d since that\ninjury. In addition, Lawson\u2019s gallbladder was removed in 2010.\n       {\u00b6 171} In 2011, Lawson suffered multiple medical problems. Severe\nheadaches required several doctor and hospital visits.        He also experienced\ndegenerative disc disease, abdominal pain, and \u201cabnormal findings related to his\ncolon and appendix.\u201d In 2017, Lawson was in a \u201cfender-bender\u201d accident and\nstruck his head on a rear-view mirror. While he did not seek medical attention at\nthe time, he experienced chronic headaches after the accident.\n       {\u00b6 172} In addition to the above factors, Lawson expressed remorse for the\nmurders in his confession and in his unsworn statement. He told the panel, \u201cI know\nwhat I did was wrong\u201d and stated that he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for what he did. He\napologized to everyone he had harmed, including the four murder victims and his\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nown family. He said that he cannot sleep at night, cries all the time, cries himself\nto sleep, and has flashbacks. He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t expect sympathy. * * * If it\nbe death penalty, then I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m at peace with whatever you give me.\u201d\nLawson also expressed his remorse to Dr. Stinson, who felt that Lawson\u2019s remorse\nwas sincere.\n       {\u00b6 173} Dr. Stinson testified about Lawson\u2019s conduct in the Morrow\nCounty jail, where he was held pending trial. A jail supervisor described Lawson\nto Dr. Stinson as trustworthy, well behaved, respectful, and \u201cnot * * * a problem.\u201d\nOther correctional officers consistently told Dr. Stinson that Lawson was not\ncausing any problems.      Whenever Dr. Stinson saw Lawson interacting with\nofficers, they seemed to have a tension-free and professional relationship. On one\noccasion, Lawson gave jail staff members advance warning that several other\ninmates were planning to disrupt jail operations by flooding their toilets.\n       {\u00b6 174} Lawson\u2019s jail records showed two \u201cwrite-ups\u201d in the approximately\n16 months he was there. In January 2018, he got upset about a lockdown, kicked a\ndoor, and threatened an officer; he lost all privileges as a result. Dr. Stinson\ndescribed the other incident as \u201cequivocal.\u201d A Lawrence County deputy sheriff\nwho was transporting Lawson accused him of resisting him and of disrespect and\ndisobedience; however, a Morrow County deputy stated that there had been no\nproblem. Lawson was not disciplined for this incident. Overall, Dr. Stinson opined\nthat when compared to other inmates he had worked with, Lawson had adjusted to\nincarceration \u201crelatively\u201d well, even \u201cremarkably well.\u201d\n                   5. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n       {\u00b6 175} The trial court gleaned one mitigating factor from the\ncircumstances of the offense: while in the Holstons\u2019 house on the day of the\nmurders, Lawson fed two-year-old B.H., changed his diaper, and put him down for\na nap. Beyond that, nothing about the nature and circumstances of the offenses in\nthis case could be considered mitigating.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                     C. Weighing\n          {\u00b6 176} We must determine whether the aggravating circumstances that\nwere found by the three-judge panel outweigh the mitigating factors presented in\nthis case beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.05(A) and 2929.03(D)(1); see State\nv. Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, \u00b6 140. We\ndetermine that they do.\n          {\u00b6 177} Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is the strongest mitigating factor in\nthis case.     At various times, Lawson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,\ndepression, and PTSD, and he did not receive adequate treatment for these\ndisorders. See State v. Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3d\n841, \u00b6 209. We note in particular that bipolar disorder is \u201ca major mental illness.\u201d\nKetterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 205. Although\nDr. Stinson did not testify that the murders were attributable to Lawson\u2019s mental\ndisorders, we find that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is entitled to substantial\nweight.\n          {\u00b6 178} We must consider Lawson\u2019s youth as a mitigating factor. See R.C.\n2929.04(B)(4). This court has frequently upheld death sentences for 23-year-old\nmurderers and has ordinarily given the (B)(4) factor little weight in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at \u00b6 195\n(\u201clittle weight\u201d); State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d\n1173, \u00b6 173 (\u201cmodest weight\u201d); State v. Ferguson, 108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-\n1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b6 127 (\u201clittle weight\u201d). We recognize that we recently\naccorded \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the age of an offender in Graham, id. at \u00b6 207.\nHowever, Graham is fundamentally distinguishable. Graham had just turned 19 at\nthe time he committed aggravated murder, a little more than one year removed from\nthe minimum age for death-penalty eligibility. In contrast, Lawson was 23 when\nhe committed the murders at issue here, a more significant passage of time from\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe minimum age of eligibility. Therefore, we consider Lawson\u2019s youth to be a\nfactor that carries some weight.\n       {\u00b6 179} The evidence that Lawson was abused is not conclusive. The\nrecord does show, however, that Lawson experienced a degree of instability in his\nupbringing, with several changes in custody and living arrangements. The evidence\nalso shows that he was surrounded by poor role models and had few good role\nmodels and that he felt unloved and worthless.\n       {\u00b6 180} Because Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the four\naggravated murders in this case, he had at least some \u201ctime to distance himself from\nhis childhood and allow other factors to assert themselves in his personality and his\nbehavior,\u201d State v. Campbell, 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 53, 765 N.E.2d 334 (2002);\ncompare Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, at \u00b6 138\n(19-year-old offender was \u201cnot far removed\u201d from his upbringing).\n       {\u00b6 181} Yet we have \u201cseldom ascribed much weight in mitigation to a\ndefendant\u2019s unstable or troubled childhood.\u201d State v. Kirkland, 160 Ohio St.3d 389,\n2020-Ohio-4079, 157 N.E.3d 716, \u00b6 174, citing Campbell at 51-54; see also State\nv. Cooey, 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 41, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989). And Lawson\u2019s childhood\nsurely presents nothing comparable to State v. Tenace, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-\nOhio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, which we have noted as \u201c[t]he benchmark case for\nassessing the weight of childhood trauma\u201d based on its \u201cappalling facts,\u201d State v.\nBeasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-493, 108 N.E.3d 1028, \u00b6 248. The\ndefendant in Tenace was raised by criminal and drug-addicted parents, sold by his\nmother for sexual services, forced to watch his sister being sexually abused, and\nencouraged to cheat and steal. Tenace at \u00b6 102-103. Therefore, Lawson\u2019s history\nand background are entitled to some weight, \u201cbut only to the extent his \u2018criminal\n* * * acts are attributable to\u2019 it,\u201d Campbell at 53, quoting California v. Brown, 479\nU.S. 538, 545, 2017 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Although retrospective remorse is ordinarily not a strong mitigating\nfactor, \u201cremorse [that] leads to surrender and confession is a more impressive\nfactor.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 93, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991). In this case,\nLawson did surrender\u2014although that decision may have been influenced by a cold\nnight in the woods without supplies, shelter, or weapons. More importantly,\nLawson gave a complete, truthful confession that aided the police with their crime-\nscene investigation. Therefore, we find that Lawson\u2019s remorse and cooperation are\nentitled to some weight in mitigation. His generally good conduct in jail is also\nentitled to some weight.\n       {\u00b6 183} With respect to D.H.\u2019s murder, the aggravating circumstances\ninclude that Lawson engaged in a course of conduct\u2014i.e., committed multiple\nmurders\u2014and the fact that D.H. was younger than 13. \u201cIn particular, the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it\ninvolves the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 328. And the cold-blooded nature\nand details of D.H.\u2019s murder are especially significant concerns. Moreover, the\ncommission of multiple murders is a grave aggravating circumstance that carries\ngreat weight. State v. Hutton, 100 Ohio St.3d 176, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d\n948, \u00b6 91.   The two felony-murder circumstances and the escaping-detection\ncircumstance add still more weight to the state\u2019s side of the scales.\n       {\u00b6 184} The murders of Stacey and her parents lack the child-murder\naggravating circumstance, but each has a course-of-conduct and a felony-murder\ncircumstance. In addition, the murders of Stacey\u2019s parents have the escaping-\ndetection circumstance.\n       {\u00b6 185} Two recent cases in which we have found that aggravation did not\noutweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, Johnson and Graham, each\ninvolved 19-year-old defendants, both of whom \u201centered a residence to commit\nrobbery and killed a [single] person inside.\u201d Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio-6700, 172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 215. By contrast, Lawson was 23 years old; he\nentered the Holstons\u2019 residence and lay in wait specifically to kill; over a period of\n12 hours, he killed four people, one an eight-year-old child who should not even\nhave been in the house, and he attempted to kill a fifth.\n        {\u00b6 186} This case invites particular comparison with Graham, which it\nresembles in that both Lawson and Graham were young defendants who suffered\nfrom untreated or insufficiently treated mental-health issues and adverse\nenvironmental factors. See Graham at \u00b6 196. In fact, Lawson\u2019s mental disorders\u2014\nbipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety\u2014are more significant than\nGraham\u2019s oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, see id.\n        {\u00b6 187} However, this case is distinguishable from Graham in numerous\nimportant ways. We have already noted some of the key distinctions: Lawson was\nfour years older than Graham was when the crimes were committed; Lawson killed\nfour people to Graham\u2019s one; one of Lawson\u2019s victims was eight years old and that\ninnocent victim was in the house only because of Lawson\u2019s deception; Lawson\nentered the house where the crimes occurred with the express purpose of\ncommitting murder, unlike Graham, who entered for the purpose of robbery with\nno intention to kill anyone. And the list goes on.\n        {\u00b6 188} While Graham was the principal offender in the aggravated murder\nhe committed, he \u201cwas not the mastermind,\u201d 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700,\n172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 205, of the drug robbery that led to the murder; he was\nrecruited by a friend. In this case, Lawson was not just the principal offender; he\nwas the sole offender. Nobody recruited or enticed him; the whole thing was his\nidea.\n        {\u00b6 189} The murder in Graham was a quick reaction to events during the\nrobbery: Graham told the victim not to look at the robbers, the victim expressed\ndoubt that Graham would shoot him, and Graham shot him. Id. at \u00b6 12. In contrast,\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nLawson planned and prepared for Stacey\u2019s murder well in advance and committed\nfour murders over a 12-hour period in which the death toll mounted.\n         {\u00b6 190} Like Lawson, Graham used marijuana daily. But unlike Lawson,\nGraham was also addicted to Xanax, using \u201cmassive\u201d daily amounts of it, Graham\nat \u00b6 199. Moreover, Graham\u2019s Xanax use made him more irritable and aggressive\nand less inhibited. Id. at \u00b6 199, 210. Indeed, Graham\u2019s expert witness testified that\nit was unlikely that Graham would have committed the murder but for his Xanax\naddiction. Id. at \u00b6 199. Lawson had a cannabis-use disorder, but according to Dr.\nStinson it caused no major impairment of his functioning, and there is no evidence\nthat drug use played any role in the murders in this case.\n         {\u00b6 191} This case is undeniably one in which the defendant has presented\nsignificant mitigating factors. But this is also a case in which the defendant\nslaughtered four people, including the callous slaying of an eight-year-old child.\nWith respect to each of the four aggravated murders before us, we find that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n                                D. Proportionality\n         {\u00b6 192} We further determine that the death sentences for these crimes are\nproportionate to sentences approved in similar cases. We have approved death\nsentences in cases combining multiple murders with one or more child murders.\nState v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051; State v.\nPowell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865; Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242; Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347,\n2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180. Indeed, we have approved death sentences in\nnumerous cases that involved multiple murders when all the victims were adults.\nSee, e.g., State v. Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, 89 N.E.3d 554\n(two murders, one attempted murder); Beasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n493, 108 N.E.3d 1028 (three murders, one attempted murder); State v. Madison,\n160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867 (three murders).\n                              VIII. CONCLUSION\n       {\u00b6 193} We affirm the judgments of conviction. We further affirm all four\nsentences of death.\n                                                                Judgment affirmed.\n       FISCHER and DEWINE, JJ., concur.\n       DONNELLY, J., concurs, with an opinion.\n       O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in judgment only and concurs in Justice\nDonnelly\u2019s concurring opinion.\n       STEWART, J., concurs in part and dissents in part and would reverse the\ndeath sentences.\n       BRUNNER, J., dissents, with an opinion.\n                               _________________\n       DONNELLY, J., concurring.\n       {\u00b6 194} Respectfully, I fully concur with this court\u2019s judgment affirming\nappellant Arron L. Lawson\u2019s convictions. I reluctantly concur, however, with this\ncourt\u2019s judgment affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentence.\n       {\u00b6 195} Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder, and depression, there is no denying that Lawson suffers from serious\nmental illnesses and that he did not receive adequate treatment for these disorders.\nOf these diagnoses, bipolar disorder has been found to be a major mental illness.\nSee State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 172,\n205. The majority opinion recognizes that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history was\nsubstantial and accorded it the mitigating factor entitled to the strongest weight.\nSee majority opinion at \u00b6 177. The General Assembly has also recognized the\ncritical importance of this issue, see 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, which became\neffective during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        54\n\f                                     January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 196} As of April 12, 2021, a person who has been diagnosed with a\n\u201cserious mental illness\u201d\u2014including bipolar disorder\u2014is ineligible for a death\nsentence, R.C. 2929.025(E)(1), when the defendant timely raises the issue and\nproves by a preponderance of the evidence, R.C. 2929.025(D)(1), that the illness\n\u201csignificantly impaired the person\u2019s capacity to exercise rational judgment,\u201d\n2929.025(A)(1)(b), with respect to either conforming to the law or appreciating the\nnature,     consequences,    or      wrongfulness         of   the   person\u2019s      conduct,\n2929.025(A)(1)(b)(i) and (ii). Because Lawson was sentenced before the effective\ndate of 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, he has one year after its effective date to seek\na   postconviction     remedy,       R.C.    2953.21(A)(2)(b).         See      also   R.C.\n2953.21(A)(1)(a)(iv) and 2953.21(A)(3)(a), as amended. Notwithstanding our\njudgment today, the postconviction statutes leave a door open for Lawson.\n          O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n                                  _________________\n          BRUNNER, J., dissenting.\n          {\u00b6 197} Testing the competency of persons accused of capital crimes is\ncritical to affording the degree of due process guaranteed by the Ohio and federal\nConstitutions and fulfills the proscription found in the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution against cruel and unusual punishment.                  Drope v.\nMissouri, 420 U.S. 162, 174-175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002). In short,\nensuring that a defendant is competent to stand trial is necessary to protect the right\nto a fair trial. Drope at 174-175.\n          {\u00b6 198} However, determining competency and the mental condition of an\naccused is not just an exercise that is relevant to trial participation. Competency\nmust also be established to convict, see Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378, 86\nS.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), and execute, see Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S.\n399, 410, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) an accused. The United States\n\n\n\n\n                                            55\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court has also prohibited the execution of severely mentally impaired\ndefendants, finding the execution of those defendants excessive and violative of a\nnumber of public policies concerning capital punishment. Atkins at 321. The\nUnited States Supreme Court has also prohibited the execution of juveniles,\nrecognizing their developmental immaturity and diminished culpability. Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-571, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). In Ohio,\nthe General Assembly has recently prohibited the imposition of the death penalty\nfor the crime of aggravated murder when the defendant had a serious mental illness\nat the time that he committed the offense. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.02(A), 2929.025,\nand other statutes enacted in 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136. This case is therefore\nabout more than whether appellant, Arron Lawson, was able to consult with his\nlawyers and reasonably understand the proceedings against him. This appeal is an\nopportunity for this court to reexamine the protections and precautions that are\ncentral to ensuring that any death sentence that is imposed is appropriate and\nsubjected to a reliable, deliberate, and rigorous constitutional review.\n       {\u00b6 199} Former Justice Paul Pfeifer stated when he served as a justice of\nthis court that \u201c[t]he death penalty should be reserved for the most severe of cases.\u201d\nState v. Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 75, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (1999) (Pfeifer, J.,\ndissenting); see also State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 563, 747 N.E.2d 765\n(2001) (Pfeifer, J., dissenting) (the death penalty should be imposed only on \u201cthose\nmurderers who truly deserve death\u201d).           It is difficult to imagine Lawson\u2019s\nhorrendous acts not falling into the category of the worst of cases. But this court is\nconstitutionally bound to not only review Lawson\u2019s sentence but also to verify the\nintegrity of the process leading to the imposition of the death penalty as the\npunishment for his crimes. This should not be a mechanistic analysis; it should be\na thorough endeavor that closely examines all aspects of the proceedings that have\nculminated in our review. Because there are too many unaddressed concerns in the\nmajority\u2019s analysis, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n   I. Lawson\u2019s Competency to Enter Guilty Pleas and Waive a Jury Trial\n            A. A trial court\u2019s duty regarding a defendant\u2019s competency\n       {\u00b6 200} When the issue of competency is \u201craised\u201d before trial by counsel\nfor a criminal defendant, by the prosecution, or by the court, a hearing on the matter\nis mandatory. R.C. 2945.37(B); State v. Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016 (1986). Likewise, after the conclusion of the trial-court proceedings, if a\nperson who was convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death wanted to forgo\nfurther legal challenges, essentially volunteering for death, this court has required\nthat the person undergo a competency evaluation and that the trial court hold a\nhearing before such a request would be honored. See State v. Berry, 74 Ohio St.3d\n1492, 658 N.E.2d 1062 (1996) (ordering that an independent psychiatric expert be\nappointed); State v. Berry, 77 Ohio St.3d 1439, 671 N.E.2d 1279 (1996) (remanding\nthe matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on mental competency). For\nthe period of litigation lying between the two markers of a death-penalty\nproceeding\u2014i.e., before the trial and during or following the sentencing (such as\nforgoing an appeal or forgoing other legal challenges)\u2014there are points at which a\ndefendant\u2019s decision or request may or is likely to be an indicator that his\ncompetency to assist in his own defense should be determined pursuant to R.C.\n2945.37(G), such as when a defendant indicates his or her wish to terminate\ncounsel\u2019s representation, when a defendant indicates his or her wish to waive a jury\ntrial, and when a defendant indicates his or her wish to forgo the presentation of all\nor some mitigating evidence at sentencing.         These pivotal points along the\ncontinuum of a death-penalty prosecution are critical events that could serve in\nwhole or in part to tip the scales of justice toward or away from the ultimate\npunishment\u2014death.\n       {\u00b6 201} Therefore, it is understood that R.C. 2945.37(B) dictates that when\nrequested before trial, a competency examination is mandatory and that when a\ndefendant wishes to waive the ability to challenge an imposed death sentence, a\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncompetency hearing is required, see State v. Berry, 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 375, 686\nN.E.2d 1097 (1997).      However, clear guidelines are lacking about the way\ncompetency should be questioned and examined in the stages that occur between\nthe period before the start of a trial and the final imposition of a death sentence.\nThus, trial courts have been free to apply whatever standards they choose during\nthose stages, and their decisions are not overturned on appeal unless there are\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d in the record, State v. Were, 94 Ohio St.3d\n173, 761 N.E.2d 591 (2002), paragraph two of the syllabus. This court has stated\nthat \u201c \u2018[c]ommon sense dictates that no defendant can make a record of lack of\ncompetency absent the findings and hearings contemplated by R.C. 2945.37 and\n2945.371.\u2019 \u201d Were at 177, quoting Bock at 113 (Wright, J., dissenting). Thus,\nrelying on a record when there is no requirement to create one is hardly the model\nof fair process, and it cannot in any sense be deemed rigorously constitutional.\n                   B. Indicia of incompetency in Lawson\u2019s case\n       {\u00b6 202} Lawson has raised three areas of concern that, taken together,\nshould be held to have triggered the trial court\u2019s duty to order a pretrial\nincompetency exam: when Lawson acted against the advice of his counsel by\nwaiving a trial and entering guilty pleas, when Lawson exhibited indecisiveness\nabout his decision to enter guilty pleas, and when Lawson revealed to the court that\nhe was taking prescription medications. Going against the advice of counsel, alone,\ndoes not equate with incompetence. Indecisiveness, alone, may not necessarily\nconstitute a clear indicator that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Nor may\ntaking prescription medications, standing alone, be a clear indicator of\nincompetence. Our inquiry in this appeal, however, is not whether we believe that\nLawson was competent; it is whether these factors taken together should be held to\nreasonably indicate to a trial court that further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s\ncompetency is required, to ensure the fairness of the proceeding, especially in a\ncapital case. See R.C. 2945.37(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                      January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 203} There were indicia, i.e., signs or indications, that should have\nprompted\u2014and did prompt\u2014the trial court to further inquire about concerns of\npossible \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d regarding Lawson\u2019s competency to\nwaive a trial and change his pleas. On multiple occasions, the trial court raised the\nissue of a possible competency evaluation.1 The record is clear that the presiding\ntrial judge was hesitating and \u201csecond-guessing\u201d whether the types of\nconsiderations underlying Atkins, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335,\nand other precedents had been observed or applied. The trial judge appeared\nhesitant about Lawson\u2019s thought process in making the grave and weighty decision\nto plead guilty in a proceeding that could carry the consequential punishment of\ndeath.\n         {\u00b6 204} Lawson\u2019s actions in waiving his right to a jury trial and entering\npleas of guilty to multiple capital offenses, combined with the trial court\u2019s\nhesitations, were indicia of incompetency that do exist in our limited record,\nconsidering that no competency examination or hearing ever occurred. It should\nnot be our role to guess from the evidence what Lawson\u2019s state of mind was and\ntherefore what his mental capabilities were.                If he had been assessed for\ncompetency, we would be able to read a report from a mental-health professional\nabout his ability and state of mind. Without that kind of evidence, it is difficult to\ndiscern from the record whether Lawson was exercising the rights of a rational,\nmentally and physically healthy person in making this decision. See Berry, 80 Ohio\nSt.3d at 375, 686 N.E.2d 1097, quoting Smith v. Armentrout, 812 F.2d 1050, 1057\n(8th Cir.1987) (it is \u201c \u2018very probable\u2019 \u201d that in \u201c \u2018every case\u2019 \u201d in which a capital\n\n\n1. The majority opinion outlines the discussions between the trial judge and counsel regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency, including an in-chambers discussion on February 11, 2019. During that\ndiscussion, the trial judge noted that he had \u201cbrought this [issue] up months ago\u201d and was now\n\u201csecond-guessing\u201d his decision to decline to order a competency evaluation. Further discussion in\nthe record occurred on February 21, 2019, when the presiding trial judge asked counsel whether\nthey had any concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d and\ninquired as to counsel\u2019s investigation of those issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                               59\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant desires to \u201c \u2018abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility\nthat the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect\u2019 \u201d). That we\nwould guess or infer what a competency evaluation would have shown debases our\nunique role in reviewing death-penalty appeals.\n       {\u00b6 205} The record is clear that when the trial court during the plea colloquy\nasked Lawson whether his mental clarity was affected by any medications, Lawson\ndisclosed that he was taking several\u2014naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and\nZoloft. The trial court questioned Lawson and defense counsel regarding these\nmedications and asked whether they could be affecting Lawson\u2019s ability to reason\nor his judgment. And while there is no affirmative indication in the record that\nLawson\u2019s medications did affect his ability to understand or reason, more inquiry\ncertainly was in order. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 174-175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103 (discussing whether, in light of inferences drawn from the undisputed evidence,\nthe trial court\u2019s failure to further inquire into a defendant\u2019s competency deprived\nhim of a fair trial). Unanswered questions remained: Why was he taking those\nmedications? How long had he been taking those medications? What medical\ndiagnoses and symptoms indicated that those medications should be prescribed?\nWas he experiencing or had he ever experienced any side effects from those\nmedications, including drowsiness, confusion, or suicidal thoughts? A competency\nexam could have provided answers to these questions to allay concerns regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency.       Lawson\u2019s statement that he was taking prescription\nmedications was, at a minimum, a legitimate factor relating to the fundamental\nquestion of his competency to stand trial and to decide to plead guilty to capital\nmurder.\n       {\u00b6 206} The majority, citing State v. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717\nN.E.2d 298 (1999), reasons that the trial court and defense counsel were able to\nobserve Lawson and that he exhibited no behavior that raised any question as to his\ncompetency. There are a number of reasons why licensed members of the legal\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nprofession and the judiciary should not perform competency evaluations based on\ntheir own observations, either directly or indirectly by reading a record. Using this\nmethod to make what amounts to a medical determination that a person charged\nwith a capital crime is or was competent is not only constitutionally flawed, it is\nunacceptable. This is particularly so when there is evidence that a defendant is\ntaking prescription medications that may affect his or her behavior or demeanor.2\nNo one asked Lawson whether drowsiness or confusion might be a side effect of\nany of his medications.           No one asked Lawson whether any of his current\nmedications were prescribed for impulse control. No one asked Lawson whether\nhe was depressed or suicidal. And no one asked him on the record why he was\nchoosing to plead guilty to capital offenses.\n         {\u00b6 207} Lawson\u2019s decision to waive a trial and enter pleas of guilty in this\ncapital case, combined with the trial court\u2019s apparent misgivings as they appear in\nthe record, support that further inquiry into Lawson\u2019s competency was necessary.\nI would thus reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment based on this issue and would\nremand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings regarding Lawson\u2019s\ncompetency.\n  C. R.C. 2945.37(B) requires a hearing when the issue of competency is raised\n         {\u00b6 208} The majority rejects Lawson\u2019s argument that R.C. 2945.37(B)\nrequired a competency hearing in this case, concluding that the issue was not\nsufficiently raised at trial and that, even if it had been, not raising it was harmless\nerror. When \u201cthe issue of the defendant\u2019s competence\u201d to stand trial is \u201craised\u201d\nbefore the trial has begun, \u201cthe court shall hold a hearing on the issue.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) R.C. 2945.37(B). The statute does not require the issue to be sufficiently\n\n\n2. According to information available on the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website, drowsiness is a side effect\nof most of the medications Lawson was taking; confusion is a side effect of Vistaril and\nmetronidazole; and suicidal thoughts, loss of memory, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality\nare side effects of Zoloft. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs (accessed July 9, 2021)\n[https://perma.cc/UL5E-XLDS].\n\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nraised, raised by motion, or raised with the intention of obtaining or ordering a\nhearing. See id. (\u201cthe court, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue\u201d).\n        {\u00b6 209} On multiple occasions before the trial began, the trial court itself\nraised the issue whether a competency evaluation should be done. See fn. 1 of this\nopinion, supra. The majority interprets the record to indicate that the trial-court\njudge was merely asking the defense whether it wanted a competency hearing. But\nisn\u2019t it just as plausible that the trial judge was truly questioning whether there was\nenough information available to reach a sound conclusion that Lawson was\ncompetent to not only stand trial but to waive it? At any rate, this was not a situation\nin which the trial judge specifically stated that Lawson \u201c \u2018evidenced no mental\ninstability,\u2019 \u201d Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298. Rather, the court\n\u201craised\u201d the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency for purposes of R.C. 2945.37(B).\n        {\u00b6 210} Nothing prohibits this court from reviewing the record and\ndetermining that the issue of competency was raised. Nothing prohibits us from\nremanding this case for a competency evaluation to be conducted and a competency\nhearing to be held; the result of that hearing would determine the course of events\nfrom that point. Such a hearing is required by statute, but one was not held. If we\ndo this, we would accomplish several important aims. We would acknowledge the\ngravity of any capital defendant\u2019s adverse-interest request to plead guilty to a\ncapital offense. We would also provide valuable guidance to this state\u2019s trial courts\nthat creating a sound record compliant with R.C. 2945.37(B) is required, especially\nwhen the defendant is making an adverse-interest decision, such as waiving a trial\nand pleading guilty to one or more capital offenses. Remanding this case for a\ncompetency hearing would be of benefit to the public in ensuring a high standard\nof compliance with due-process principles in cases in which a death sentence could\nbe imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 211} The issue of Lawson\u2019s competency was raised, requiring the trial\ncourt to hold a competency hearing. See Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016; R.C. 2945.37(B). We should require that this hearing be held.\n                 D. General problems with the current framework\n       {\u00b6 212} When a capital defendant seeks to abandon his or her rights and\nacquiesce in entering a guilty plea, essentially clearing the thorny thicket on the\npath toward execution by the state, we owe that defendant, the victims and their\nfamilies, the lower courts, and the public at large a standardized approach to ensure\nfairness and uniformity in trials of this gravamen. Viewing the record using the\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d method falls short, because it is based on\ngleaning information from a record when often no record was made.\n       {\u00b6 213} It is not acceptable to simply rely on the observations of the trial\ncourt and/or the experiences and opinions of defense counsel that a criminal\ndefendant is competent to stand trial.        The dissenting opinion in State v.\nMontgomery, relying on State v. Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 66, and United States v. Damon, 191 F.3d 561, 565 (4th Cir.1999),\nsquarely addressed this point:\n\n\n       The majority seems to be satisfied that [appellant, Caron\n       Montgomery,] stated in open court that he understood what he was\n       doing and that he signed a written waiver. This conclusion was\n       bolstered by the opinion of Montgomery\u2019s attorney\u2014who was not a\n       medical expert\u2014that Montgomery understood the rights that he was\n       waiving. But if medication prevented Montgomery from truly\n       comprehending his actions, how reliable were his spoken assurances\n       and his signed statement to the contrary? The trial court did not\n       inquire about whether or how the medications affected\n       Montgomery\u2019s abilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n               I believe that more was required under Mink and Damon. At\n       the very least, when someone is undoubtedly under the influence of\n       a prescription medication when making the decision to enter a guilty\n       plea, the trial court must inquire about the effects of the medication\n       so that it can ensure that the defendant understands the gravity of the\n       situation and comprehends his or her actions. This court should not\n       affirm a conviction, let alone a death sentence, by guessing about\n       the mental competence of a defendant. Further inquiry was required\n       before the trial court accepted Montgomery\u2019s plea of guilty.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71\nN.E.3d 180, \u00b6 196-197 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting). Most attorneys and judges are not\npracticing mental-health or disability experts. Relying on a defense attorney\u2019s\nopinion, when that opinion is likely to be a one-off (based on how defense counsel\ninterprets the defendant\u2019s behavior at that particular juncture of the trial),\nanecdotally based opinion on the defendant\u2019s competency is neither a sound legal\nnor ethical practice.   Judging a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity to reason and\nunderstand through observed behavior by defense counsel and/or the court,\nespecially when coupled with a grave, adverse-interest decision such as pleading\nguilty to one or more capital offenses, denies due process when the defendant is\ntaking prescription medication with clinical indications and side effects that\nresearch shows may affect sound reasoning at the time the defendant changes his\nor her plea. And, finally, there is an inherent and systemic flaw that may not even\nbe recognized when we perpetuate reliance on judges\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 subjective\nassessments of a capital defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or change a plea:\nperhaps we perpetuate predisposed ideas and stereotyped, culture- or race-based\nperceptions and predispositions about what is acceptable behavior during a trial.\nSee State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 62-\n\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n63 (giving deference to those who saw and heard the proceedings and stating that\nthe defendant \u201cdisplayed no outrageous, irrational behavior during trial\u201d). We can\ndo better than this. We are obligated to do better than this, especially in capital-\nmurder trials, when the ultimate penalty is death at the hands of the state.\n         {\u00b6 214} In the last 35 years, this court has rarely determined that a\ncompetency examination or hearing was warranted based on indicia in the record.3\nIn an opinion that might be considered an outlier, Were, 94 Ohio St.3d 173, 761\nN.E.2d 591, we remanded a death-penalty case for the trial court to conduct a\npretrial competency hearing. This result was based on defense counsel\u2019s repeated\nrequests for a competency hearing; on one defense attorney\u2019s opinion, based on his\nprior experience as a probate-court referee in civil-commitment hearings, that the\n\n\n3. In examining cases in which this court has considered the issue whether a competency\nexamination or hearing should have been conducted when a defendant made a request adverse to\nhis own interest, this court has overwhelmingly held that insufficient indicia of incompetency were\npresent. See, e.g., Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio 5487, 71 N.E.2d 180, at \u00b6 57-59\n(insufficient indicia of incompetency when defendant answered questions appropriately at plea\nhearing, defense counsel\u2019s assessment of competency was informed, and defendant displayed no\noutrageous, irrational, or confused behavior); State v.

Id. at 175-176.\nWe determined that this perfect storm of facts met the \u201csufficient indicia\u201d test: a\ndefense attorney who was adept at recognizing potential incompetency, a defendant\nwhose behavior rose to such a level that his counsel believed that he was not able\nto understand the proceedings against him, and the existence in the record of\nnumerous motions and requests for a competency assessment. Id. This court\u2019s\ndecision today permits and perpetuates a practice that a clinical evaluation of the\nmental competence of a defendant in a death-penalty case is not needed when a\ndefendant pleads guilty to the crime, even though there is ample evidence in the\nrecord of his mental illness. And we find today that no medical evaluation for\ncompetency is required when a defendant\u2019s experienced attorney\u2014by self-\nproclamation\u2014has adjudged his client to be competent based on counsel\u2019s stated\nability to recognize mental illness, even when that client may not outwardly\ndemonstrate visible symptoms of mental illness to nonclinical laypersons during\nthe limited time they interact with them.\n       {\u00b6 215} In short, the approach perpetuated in this case denies criminal\ndefendants accused of capital crimes the guarantee that the laws of this state will\nbe applied in a rigorously constitutional manner when the consequences may be\nirrevocable. We should not continue to rely on indicia in the record as sufficient to\ndetermine a defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty without requiring evidence\nbased on sound medical judgment. It is incumbent on this court to require in death-\npenalty cases what is now readily at our disposal\u2014the use of science in a\ncompetency evaluation so that the state puts to death only those whom we may\nfairly determine have knowingly and competently pleaded guilty. In doing this, we\nwould avoid what amounts to guessing who is competent based on \u201cindicia\u201d (that\nmay or may not make it into the record) in favor of science-based evidence that is\ninformed by evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n     E. The need for evidence-based practices and not just indicia in the record\n        {\u00b6 216} On February 21, 2019, when the trial court held a change-of-plea\nhearing for Lawson, the presiding judge asked defense counsel whether they had\nany concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency.\u201d\nLead defense counsel first informed the court that he was not \u201ca psychologist or a\npsychiatrist\u201d and was not in a position to \u201ctechnically answer\u201d that question.\nDefense counsel then informed the trial court that Dr. Bob Stinson had been\nconsulted on the issue and that the defense did not intend to raise the issue of\nLawson\u2019s competency. At this point in the proceedings, there was nothing in the\nrecord about Lawson\u2019s being suicidal, having attempted suicide in the past, having\nexperienced (or at the time experiencing) confusion and possible hallucinations, or\ntaking several medications. The fact that those indicia were not yet in the record at\nthis point does not negate their existence. It does, however, demonstrate the\ninherent flaws in this court\u2019s current \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d test.\n        {\u00b6 217} Defense counsel, the prosecutors, and the trial court entertained the\npossibility of having Dr. Stinson render an opinion on Lawson\u2019s competency. Dr.\nStinson had been hired as a mental- and behavioral-health expert for the mitigation\nphase of the trial. He was not hired to perform a competency examination for the\npurpose of trial. However, had the trial court been able to conduct at least a review\nof his written report at this juncture of the proceedings, the following would have\nbecome apparent:\n1.      Lawson was raised in a dysfunctional family, suffered from poverty,\n        emotional abuse, and probably physical abuse, and was exposed to familial\n        incest;\n2.      Lawson\u2019s family members had a history of mental illness, including bipolar\n        disorder, depression, and suicidal behavior, and had a history of alcoholism\n        and drug abuse; Lawson\u2019s mother was rated as being \u201csignificantly\n        functionally impaired\u201d by her physician;\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n3.     Lawson had mental-health problems starting at least by age 13, when he\n       was enrolled in anger-management classes; he was diagnosed with bipolar\n       disorder in 2011; he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on two\n       occasions following suicidal and homicidal episodes; he has been diagnosed\n       with depressive disorder and posttraumatic-stress disorder;\n4.     Since his psychiatric hospitalizations, he has been on a number of\n       medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressant medicines,\n       antipsychotic drugs, and a medication to help with sleep and to control\n       impulses;\n5.     After his arrest, Lawson was seen by staff members at Shawnee Mental\n       Health, where he disclosed that he had attempted to hang himself several\n       years before and reported that he had been having thoughts of suicide;\n6.     After his arrest, Lawson was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and\n       reported to Dr. Stinson that he was having trouble sleeping and\n       concentrating and was occasionally having auditory and visual\n       hallucinations.\n       {\u00b6 218} This information about Lawson was not discussed at all at this point\nin the proceedings even though it is discussed in this court\u2019s majority opinion. The\nArron Lawson identified and described in Dr. Stinson\u2019s report is a person impaired\nby mental illness who has a stated history of being suicidal. The trial court was not\npresented with this information until the mitigation phase of the proceeding, and\nthis is precisely an example of the problem with the test this court adopted in the\npast and once again applies in Lawson\u2019s case. Had the trial court simply ordered a\ncompetency examination, as was discussed at several junctures during the trial\nphase, the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency to stand trial would have been made clear\nin the record beyond the mere presence of vague indicia that the record now\ncontains.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 219} Putting someone to death for his or her crimes, even when the\ncrimes are heinous and when it is apparent that the person on trial is the person who\ncommitted the crimes, is always subject to the constitutional due-process principles\ncontained in the Bill of Rights, a document once demanded by, and its contents now\nguaranteed to, the people. Due-process principles are not satisfied by guessing or\nby the acknowledged inexactitude of gleaning indicia from a sketchy trial record.\nThe determination of Lawson\u2019s competency should be based on evidence. That the\nquestion of his competency was \u201craised\u201d was enough to require the trial court to\norder a competency evaluation and a hearing on the matter under R.C. 2945.37(B),\nno matter what his attorney said to the court. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 177, 95 S.Ct.\n896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (finding that even when a question of competency is inartfully\nraised \u201cit would have been, at the very least, the better practice to order an\nimmediate examination\u201d).\n          {\u00b6 220} No longer should this court rely on the mere scaffolding of\ntradition, intuition, and prior case authority for determining a matter that is the\nsubject of scientifically supportable evidence, especially when a statute (R.C.\n2945.37(B)) requires otherwise.       The benefits of requiring evidenced-based\npractices when determining a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial are similar to\nthe benefits that are detailed in clinical literature for programs involving everything\nfrom medicine and nursing, to education, to mental-health and substance-abuse\nservices, to psychiatry, to the imposing of criminal-justice sanctions and more. See,\ne.g., Social Programs that Work, http://www.evidencebasedprograms.org\n(accessed July 9, 2021) [https://perma.cc/T76K-9KFZ].

This governmental center \u201cprovides communities,\nclinicians, policy-makers and others with the information and tools to incorporate\nevidence-based practices into their communities or clinical settings.\u201d Id. The\ncenter\u2019s website contains a plethora of publications on both substance abuse and\nmental illness, including co-occurring disorders, for both youths and adults. This\ncourt should be requiring that evidence-based practices be the standard for\ncompetency evidence used by the courts of this state for what are essentially clinical\nconclusions regarding defendants\u2019 competency to stand trial. Once we do this, we\nwill have taken a giant stride to ensure that due-process principles are adhered to in\nthe prosecutions of persons accused of crimes, especially those accused of\ncommitting capital crimes.\n     F. Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest request\n       {\u00b6 221} When reading the fact pattern of violence and often torture that\noccurs in nearly every death-penalty case, the reader is left to conjecture: Who in\ntheir right mind could do such a thing? Since that perception is present from the\nbeginning, and since an adverse-interest request such as agreeing to plead guilty to\na capital offense as charged could be viewed as irrational and against the\ndefendant\u2019s self-interests, it would be best for courts to start from a presumption\nthat competency is at issue whenever a defendant makes an adverse-interest\nrequest. Starting with this presumption and questioning competency in this way\nwould mean that a trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2945.37(B) would be ensured.\nThe trial court would then be required to conduct further inquiry, thus creating a\nrecord and instilling a more reliable, constitutional approach.\n       {\u00b6 222} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest alleviates the necessity for a court to inquire as to defense counsel\u2019s position\non the subject. The judiciary must dismiss the temptation to put defense attorneys\nin the position of assessing their clients\u2019 capabilities, which goes beyond the\nattorneys\u2019 expertise and their ethical duties. We also should steer courts away from\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nlooking for subjectively bizarre behavior and encourage them to simply obtain\ninformation from a clinical expert using evidence-based practices.\n       {\u00b6 223} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest also triggers the building of a record. A competency examination and a\nhearing would be the most comprehensive way to ensure a complete and thorough\nrecord. The trial court should make a finding one way or the other based on\nevidence in the record regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand\nchoices and assist in his or her own defense. This includes determining whether\nthe defendant possesses the ability to comprehend the ramifications of his or her\ndecision, including understanding that the choice may lead to death, determining\nwhether the defendant is able to make such a decision knowingly and intelligently,\nnot unduly affected by conditions of mental health, physical health, or\nimprisonment, and determining whether the defendant possesses the ability to\nreason logically and fully understands the ramifications of his decision. Berry, 80\nOhio St.3d at 371, 374-376, 686 N.E.2d 1097.\n       {\u00b6 224} For example, in State v. Mink, in which the defendant was charged\nwith aggravated murder for the horrendous stabbings and beatings of his parents,\nthe trial court sua sponte appointed two psychologists to conduct separate\ncompetency examinations when Mink first informed the court that he wished to\nenter pleas of guilty to all counts, to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand to represent himself. 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064,\nat \u00b6 31, 59-60. The trial court then made an initial determination based on the\nreports of those psychologists that Mink was competent to stand trial and accepted\nhis guilty pleas and later made a separate determination that Mink was competent\nto waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, after which it sentenced him to\ndeath. Id. at \u00b6 22-26, 60. This court affirmed Mink\u2019s death sentence and he was\neventually executed as he had requested, see id. at \u00b6 26, but because the trial court\nhad insisted on and had conducted a thorough, evidence-based process, we were\n\n\n\n\n                                         71\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nnot left to doubt the constitutionality of Mink\u2019s death sentence with regard to his\ncompetency. We noted that the trial court had gone \u201cto great lengths\u201d before\nfinding him competent, id. at \u00b6 59, and that the court had \u201cfully protected Mink\u2019s\nconstitutional rights in determining his competency,\u201d id. at \u00b6 61.\n        {\u00b6 225} Perhaps not every decision a defendant in a capital case makes that\nis against his or her interest should trigger a competency evaluation, but it would\nbehoove courts to proceed thoughtfully and cautiously. For example, a clinical\nexamination might not be required when a defendant wishes to waive representation\nby counsel. When making a decision like that, the defendant still has procedural\nand substantive protections in place. Courts should seek to examine a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency in view of the context and purpose of the proceeding. Therefore,\ncompetency evaluations should be specifically tailored to address the capacity and\nthe ability of the defendant to understand the ramifications of the specific adverse-\ninterest request he or she is making. See Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 150, 150-\n151, 86 S.Ct. 1320, 16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966).4\n\n4. See also the trial court\u2019s \u201cDecision and Entry Finding the Defendant Competent to Waive the\nPresentation of Mitigating Evidence,\u201d in State v. Mink, Montgomery C.P. No. 2000-CR-2900 (June\n28, 2001):\n\n                 Applying the criteria set forth in State v. Ashworth (1999), 85 Ohio St.3d\n        56, [706 N.E.2d 1231,] and Based upon the Court\u2019s inquiry of the Defendant\n        conducted in open court and the competency reports of Dr. Thomas O. Martin and\n        Dr. Kim Stookey, the Court finds that the Defendant:\n                 1.) Understands the choice between life and death,\n                 2.) Has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to\n                 pursue the presentation of evidence,\n                 3.) Fully understands the ramifications of his decision,\n                 4.) Possesses the ability to reason logically, i.e. to choose means that\n                 relate logically to his ends,\n                 5.) Understands his right to present mitigating evidence,\n                 6.) Understands the meaning of mitigating evidence,\n                 7.) Understands the importance of mitigating evidence,\n                 8.) Understands the use of mitigating evidence to offset the aggravating\n                 circumstances and,\n                 9.) Understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence.\n                 The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n        presentation of mitigating evidence is made knowingly, intelligently and\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 226} Additionally, requiring that a record be developed when a\ndefendant invokes an adverse-interest request ensures balance in the system. If\nLawson had been asked further questions, his suicidal ideation and suicide attempt\nmay have become known to the court, as counsel presumably were aware of those\nmatters. At that point, any court would certainly have sought further information\nabout the defendant\u2019s mental health and capabilities before allowing the trial to\nproceed for the state to seek his execution. See Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d at 64, 706\nN.E.2d 1231 (noting the state\u2019s interest \u201cin not allowing the death penalty statute\nto be used as a means of state-assisted suicide\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 227} Because we must ensure rigorous compliance with constitutional\nstandards in capital cases, I cannot concur in affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentences\nunder our current framework of analysis.\n       II. The Validity of Lawson\u2019s Jury-Trial Waiver and Guilty Pleas\n       {\u00b6 228} Insofar as Lawson\u2019s claims that his waiver of a jury trial and pleas\nof guilty were not done knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, for the same\nreasons articulated above that the court should have ordered a competency\nexamination, I cannot concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record supports\nthat Lawson\u2019s pleas were fairly entered, underpinned by an adequate ability to\nreason and understand the proceedings against him.\n       {\u00b6 229} In accepting the waiver and pleas, even if the trial court had\ncomplied with State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 423 N.E.2d 115 (1981),\nparagraph one of the syllabus, and with Crim.R. 11, and even if the trial court had\nsufficiently inquired about Lawson\u2019s use of medications, Lawson was never asked\nwhy he wanted to enter the guilty pleas; his answer to that question may have\nclarified his lack of perceived or real duress, delusion, misunderstanding, or\nsuicidal motivation.\n\n       voluntarily. The Court therefore accepts the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n       presentation of mitigating evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 230} For these reasons, this court should be encouraging trial courts to\nthoroughly and appropriately examine a defendant\u2019s competency and state of mind\nwhen the defendant makes an adverse-interest request\u2014such as pleading guilty to\none or more capital offenses\u2014rather than tolerating trial courts\u2019 failures to comply\nwith R.C. 2945.37(B).\n                                  III. Conclusion\n       {\u00b6 231} Because this court should not endorse a death sentence when the\nconstitutionality of a defendant\u2019s convictions remains in doubt, I respectfully\ndissent from the majority\u2019s judgment. I would reverse Lawson\u2019s convictions and\nthe sentences of death. I would further remand this case for the trial court to order\na competency examination that it contemplated ordering before it accepted\nLawson\u2019s guilty pleas and to hold a hearing based on the findings and\nrecommendations contained in that evaluation, in accord with what I believe this\ncourt\u2019s holding should be, as expressed in this dissenting opinion.\n                               _________________\n       Brigham M.

Lawson, murdered four\npeople: Stacey Holston, her eight-year-old son D.H., her mother, Tammie McGuire,\nand her mother\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire. On October 13, Lawson surrendered\nto police and confessed to the murders.\n        {\u00b6 3} The Lawrence County grand jury returned an 11-count indictment,\nincluding four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications.\nLawson entered guilty pleas to all counts and specifications of the indictment.\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.06, a three-judge panel of the common pleas court heard the\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nstate\u2019s evidence of guilt with regard to the capital charges. The panel found Lawson\nguilty of four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications as to\neach count. The panel then conducted a sentencing hearing and sentenced Lawson\nto death for each aggravated murder.\n       {\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Lawson raises five propositions of law. We overrule\neach of the propositions of law. After conducting an independent review, we\nconclude that although significant mitigating factors exist, the aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\nof the four aggravated murders. We further conclude that each death sentence is\nappropriate and proportionate. Therefore, we affirm all four death sentences.\n                 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                     A. Facts\n       {\u00b6 5} Arron Lawson was Stacey Holston\u2019s first cousin. Stacey lived with\nher husband, Todd Holston, and their sons, D.H. and two-year-old B.H., near Pedro,\nOhio. Lawson lived nearby and was in the habit of visiting the Holstons daily.\n       {\u00b6 6} Lawson was infatuated with Stacey; he told his mother that she was\n\u201cthe love of his life.\u201d In his confession, he stated that he and Stacey had been\nhaving a sexual affair, which Stacey had broken off \u201c[a]bout a week ago,\u201d i.e.,\napproximately October 6, 2017.\n       {\u00b6 7} Lawson visited Stacey on Tuesday, October 10, 2017, the day before\nthe murders, while Todd was at work. During this visit, Lawson surreptitiously\nentered a bedroom at the back of the house, opened a window, and inserted a book\nbetween the window and the sill to hold the window partly open. By his own later\nadmission, he did this with the intention of entering the house the next day to\ncommit murder.\n       {\u00b6 8} At about 7:15 p.m., when Todd came home, Lawson was still there\nwith Stacey and the children. At Stacey\u2019s request, Todd drove Lawson home. Todd\ntestified at trial that Lawson \u201cwasn\u2019t too happy about\u201d being sent home.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The next morning, Todd left for work at approximately 4:30 a.m.\nAbout half an hour later, Lawson entered the Holstons\u2019 residence through the rear\nwindow. He had a 20-gauge shotgun, eight shells loaded with slugs, and a backpack\ncontaining flashlights, toilet paper, knives, a tarp, and other items. Lawson hid in\nthe back bedroom until about 8:30 a.m.\n       {\u00b6 10} Meanwhile, D.H.\u2019s school bus arrived and D.H. left the house to go\nto school. Stacey sent with him a note directing the school to put D.H. on a different\nbus that afternoon than he normally rode and to take him to his grandparents\u2019 house.\n       {\u00b6 11} By 8:30, after D.H. had left, Stacey was in the home with B.H.\nStacey entered the back bedroom where Lawson was hiding, and Lawson shot her\nthree times in the chest and shoulder. She fell to the floor.\n       {\u00b6 12} Lawson dragged her body to D.H.\u2019s bedroom where he lifted her\nonto a futon bed and, using a condom, had sex with her corpse. Lawson discarded\nthe condom in the kitchen wastebasket. He then returned to the bedroom and\ncovered Stacey\u2019s body with a blanket and the futon\u2019s mattress.\n       {\u00b6 13} As these events were occurring, Todd was at a worksite in Maysville,\nKentucky, where he clocked in at 6:43 a.m. It was Stacey\u2019s habit to send Todd a\ntext message early every morning to make sure he had arrived safely at work. When\nshe failed to do so on October 11, Todd began to worry. He repeatedly tried to call\nand text her throughout the day, but she did not respond.\n       {\u00b6 14} At 9:23 a.m., Lawson used Stacey\u2019s cell phone to call D.H.\u2019s school.\nPosing as Todd, Lawson told the school\u2019s guidance secretary that D.H.\u2019s\ngrandfather was unable to watch D.H. that day, so D.H. should be taken home on\nhis usual bus that afternoon. Lawson spoke calmly and gave the guidance secretary\nno reason to doubt he was who he claimed to be. Because Lawson was using\nStacey\u2019s phone, the phone number on the school\u2019s caller ID matched the number\non file in the office. So the original arrangement was canceled and D.H. was\nbrought home after school. Meanwhile, Lawson waited at the Holstons\u2019 residence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nHe fed B.H., changed his diaper, and later put him down for a nap in the main\nbedroom.\n        {\u00b6 15} When D.H. arrived home, Lawson sat with him in the living room\nand they talked about school. However, D.H. began asking Lawson where his\nmother was and when his father was coming home. Lacking answers, Lawson told\nD.H. that Lawson\u2019s PlayStation 3 was in D.H.\u2019s room behind the dresser. D.H.\nwent to his bedroom. As D.H. looked behind his dresser, Lawson shot him twice,\nonce in the arm and once in the torso. Lawson left the boy\u2019s body where it fell and\ncovered it with clothes. After killing D.H., Lawson continued to wait in the\nHolstons\u2019 residence.\n        {\u00b6 16} Around 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., Todd tried again to contact Stacey on his\nway home from his worksite. He then called Stacey\u2019s mother, Tammie McGuire,\nwho lived about a quarter mile from the Holstons. Tammie agreed to check on\nStacey and drove to the house. A few minutes later, she called Todd back and told\nhim that she was at his house but that the door was locked. Todd authorized her to\nbreak in, and she did. The phone connection remained open. A few minutes later,\nTodd heard Tammie scream, \u201cOh, my God\u201d followed by a loud noise. Then, as\nTodd later testified, \u201call of a sudden it was just quiet.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 17} By Lawson\u2019s account, he was in the main bedroom when he heard\nTammie forcing her way into the house. He hid behind the bedroom door; when\nTammie opened that door, he stepped out and shot her. Lawson dragged Tammie\u2019s\nbody to the laundry area and threw a blanket over her. He then used her keys to\nmove her truck behind the house.\n        {\u00b6 18} Meanwhile, Todd phoned Tammie\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire, and\napprised him of the situation. Donald said he would go and check, and he walked\nto the house.\n        {\u00b6 19} According to Lawson, Donald initially tried to enter through the\nback door, but it was locked, so Donald went around to the locked front door and\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u201crammed through.\u201d When Donald came in, Lawson shot him and dragged the body\nto D.H.\u2019s bedroom.\n        {\u00b6 20} About 10 to 20 minutes later, Todd arrived home. When he came\nthrough the front door, Lawson attacked him with a knife, stabbing him a number\nof times in the head, neck, and torso. Todd wrested the knife from Lawson and\npinned him to the couch.\n        {\u00b6 21} Todd asked Lawson why he had attacked him.            According to\nLawson, he then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a blind thing of anger.\u201d But\nTodd testified that Lawson had said, \u201cThere\u2019s been people breaking in out here, and\nI thought you was one of them.\u201d According to Todd, Lawson then \u201cshook like he\nsnapped out of something.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 22} Todd also asked Lawson where Stacey and the children were.\nLawson said they were in the bedroom and were \u201cokay.\u201d Todd testified that he\nthen forcefully removed Lawson from the house. Lawson drove away in the truck\nbelonging to the McGuires.\n        {\u00b6 23} Todd checked on B.H., who was unharmed. (According to Lawson,\nB.H. slept through at least the first three murders.) Todd then looked through the\nhouse. After finding the bodies of Tammie, Stacey, and Donald, he took B.H. and\ndrove to the McGuires\u2019 house, where he borrowed a cell phone from Tammie\u2019s\nbrother and called 9-1-1.\n        {\u00b6 24} Lawson had planned to hide out in the woods, but he had left his\nbackpack and shotgun behind in the Holstons\u2019 house, so he drove to a store. With\ncash stolen from the Holstons, he bought new clothes to replace his bloodstained\nones.\n        {\u00b6 25} While driving the truck, Lawson was pursued by police; he\nabandoned the truck and fled on foot. Eventually, he reached a wooded area, where\nhe spent the next two nights. Lawson later said that after one \u201ccold, cold night\u201d in\nthe woods, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have no more flight in me.\u201d Nevertheless, he did not\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemerge from the woods until the morning of October 13, when he was apprehended.\nDetectives took him to the county prosecutor\u2019s office in Ironton, where he\nconfessed to the four murders.\n       {\u00b6 26} Dr. Robert Shott, the deputy Montgomery County coroner,\nperformed autopsies on all four victims. He testified that Stacey suffered two\nshotgun wounds to the chest and one to the back, fatally injuring her heart and\nlungs. D.H. was shot twice, receiving fatal wounds to the heart, lung, and aorta.\nTammie was shot once in the neck, fatally injuring her spinal cord, and once in the\nshoulder. Donald was shot once in the shoulder and once, fatally, in the chest.\n                              B. Procedural History\n       {\u00b6 27} On October 18, 2017, the grand jury indicted Lawson on four counts\nof aggravated murder with death specifications. Count 1 charged the aggravated\nmurder of Stacey Holston with prior calculation and design, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A).      Count 1 carried three death specifications: course of conduct\ninvolving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(5); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7),\npredicated on rape.\n       {\u00b6 28} Count 2 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of D.H., a child\nunder the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(C). This count carried six death\nspecifications: course of conduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder of a\nvictim younger than 13, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9); murder to escape\ndetection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated\non kidnapping; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Count 3 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Tammie\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Count 4 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Donald\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Counts 3 and 4 both carried four death specifications: a course of\nconduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n       {\u00b6 30} The indictment also included the following noncapital counts: Count\n5, attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.02(A); Count 6,\nfelonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Count 7, aggravated burglary,\nin violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2); Count 8, rape, in violation of R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2); Count 9, abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B); Count\n10, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Count 11, tampering with\nevidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1); Count 12, theft of a motor vehicle, in\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(5); and Count 13, failure to comply with\na police officer\u2019s order, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii). Counts\n1 through 4 and Counts 7, 8, and 10 carried firearm specifications.\n       {\u00b6 31} On February 21, 2019, the state voluntarily dismissed the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8) specifications that were attached to Counts 2, 3, and 4. Lawson then\nentered pleas of guilty to all remaining counts and specifications before the three-\njudge panel. Over the next few days, the three-judge panel heard witness testimony\nas required by R.C. 2945.06 and on February 25, 2019, unanimously found Lawson\nguilty of all counts of the indictment except Count 8 (rape) and of all specifications\nexcept the specification for felony murder predicated on rape that was attached to\nCount 1 (aggravated murder of Stacey).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The panel then held a mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C.\n2929.03(D)(1) beginning on February 26, 2019. After hearing the evidence that\nLawson offered in mitigation, the panel sentenced him to death on all four counts\nof aggravated murder. He also received sentences totaling 59 years and six months\non the noncapital counts and specifications. Lawson appeals of right and we now\naddress his propositions of law.\n      II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY\n                                     HEARING\n       {\u00b6 33} Lawson initially pleaded not guilty to the indictment. More than a\nyear later, he changed his mind, waived a jury trial, and entered guilty pleas to each\ncount of the indictment and to all the death specifications (except the three that the\nstate voluntarily dismissed). In so doing, he acted against his trial counsel\u2019s advice.\n       {\u00b6 34} Defense counsel never requested a hearing into Lawson\u2019s\ncompetence to stand trial. Nevertheless, in his first proposition of law, Lawson\ncontends that the trial court had a constitutional duty to inquire into his competence\nto stand trial before accepting his change of plea.\n                                 A. Relevant Facts\n       {\u00b6 35} On February 11, 2019, several days into the jury-selection process,\ndefense counsel informed the trial court that Lawson did not want a trial. In\nchambers, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys explained that Lawson did not want to put\nhimself, his family, and the families of the victims through a full trial \u201cwith all of\nthe gruesome photos that would be presented [and] all of the things that would be\n* * * said about him.\u201d Counsel said that he had explained to Lawson that if he\nentered a guilty plea, the case would proceed before a three-judge panel, not a jury.\n       {\u00b6 36} Defense counsel then observed:\n\n\n       I suppose * * * if he wants to do that, there\u2019s always a question of\n       whether or not there needs to be an examination of his competence\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        to waive jury in a capital case. Obviously that\u2019s not something that\n        we can [determine] today. And it may be something that would\n        require a psychological evaluation, although in a capital case, I\n        would ask for an independent one rather than what we would do in\n        a typical case.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 37} One of the prosecutors noted that the defense team included a\npsychologist, Dr. Bob Stinson, and asked whether Dr. Stinson could render an\nopinion on Lawson\u2019s competence. Defense counsel replied that he could not\n\u201ccommit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that,\u201d because a competency assessment is\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d from a mitigation assessment.        Nevertheless, defense\ncounsel noted that Dr. Stinson \u201c[o]bviously * * * would have more familiarity with\n[Lawson] than anyone else\u201d and stated that he \u201cassume[d] that it could be done in\na manner\u201d; he also stated that he had not \u201cthought through whether that would\ncreate some sort of a conflict in terms of what [Dr. Stinson\u2019s] testimony would be\nin the mitigation phase.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 38} The trial judge then stated that he had \u201cbrought this up months ago\non the potential for a competency evaluation\u201d but that he had declined to order one\nbecause the defense had opposed it. (Any previous discussions of competency\nissues must have occurred off the record, as the transcript does not reflect any\ndiscussion of a competency evaluation before February 11.) The trial judge\ncontinued, \u201cI\u2019m now second-guessing myself that I should have [ordered] it over\nobjection.\u201d       Defense counsel remarked that the court was \u201cnot incorrect\u201d in\ndeclining to order an evaluation over the defense\u2019s opposition. The prosecutor\npointed out that the defense had not raised a question about Lawson\u2019s competence\nto stand trial.\n        {\u00b6 39} At the request of defense counsel, the court took a recess so that\nLawson could discuss the matter with his family. When the session resumed,\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefense counsel told the court at a bench conference that \u201cafter much thought,\nconsideration, [and] discussion with family members and counsel,\u201d Lawson had\ndecided not to change his plea and would proceed with a jury trial. The court then\nresumed the jury-selection process and the prospective jurors were brought into the\ncourtroom.\n       {\u00b6 40} The next day, however, Lawson\u2019s counsel informed the trial court\nthat Lawson had decided to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea\nto a three-judge panel. The trial court questioned Lawson at length about whether\nhe understood that he was waiving his constitutional right to have a jury hear and\ndecide the case. Lawson affirmatively stated a number of times that he understood\nthe consequences of his decision.\n       {\u00b6 41} During this exchange, the trial court asked Lawson whether he had\nconsulted with his family about his decision.          Lawson answered that after\nconsulting with his family the previous day, he \u201chad a second thought throughout\nthe night.\u201d He informed the trial court that \u201cit was a little rough because I saw my\nmom crying and it always plays on my heart. And then after a while I have to make\na better decision for my life and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 42} The trial court accepted Lawson\u2019s waiver. Lawson\u2019s counsel then\nfiled a written waiver of jury trial that Lawson had signed. Defense counsel\ncertified in writing that they had consulted with Lawson, had explained his right to\na jury trial, and believed that his waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\nThe trial court\u2019s acceptance of Lawson\u2019s jury waiver was also filed; it included the\ntrial court\u2019s finding that the waiver was made \u201cknowingly, intelligently and\nvoluntarily.\u201d On February 19, 2019, the chief justice of this court assigned two\nadditional judges to serve on the three-judge panel.\n       {\u00b6 43} On February 21, 2019, the panel held a change-of-plea hearing. At\nthe hearing, defense counsel stated that they had discussed the change of plea with\nLawson for about 90 minutes that day. Prior to proceeding to consider the change\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nof plea, the presiding judge asked counsel whether at any point they ever had any\nconcerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency * * * that\nwould have prevented him from knowingly and intelligently and voluntarily\nentering into th[e] plea waiver\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that based on\nhis many years of experience with representing incompetent clients, his interactions\nwith Lawson gave him \u201cno reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of\nthose categories.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 44} The presiding judge then asked whether defense counsel had\n\u201cconducted appropriate investigation * * * into * * * mental issues or competency\nissues.\u201d One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied that with Dr. Stinson\u2019s assistance, they\nhad conducted such an investigation. After lengthy discussions with Dr. Stinson,\nthe attorney said, the defense had elected not to raise the issue of \u201cpossible\nincompetency to proceed in this matter.\u201d\n            B. The Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire Into Competence\n  1. Historical perspective on the prohibition against the trial of incompetent\n                                     defendants\n       {\u00b6 45} The fundamental principle that a criminal defendant who has been\nadjudicated to be legally incompetent shall not be required to stand trial has deep\nroots in common law. See Freeman v. People, 4 Denio 9, 1847 WL 4116, *19\n(N.Y.1847) (recognizing that new competency legislation \u201cwas not introductory\u201d\nas it was \u201cin strict conformity with the common law on the subject\u201d). The\nprohibition against the trial of incompetent defendants \u201cdates back at least to the\ntime of [Sir William] Blackstone.\u201d Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct.\n2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993), fn. 11. In the eighteenth century, Blackstone wrote\nthat if a man commits an offense and becomes \u201cmad\u201d after the commission of the\noffense, then he should not be arraigned for it \u201cbecause he is not able to plead to it\nwith that advice and caution that he ought.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\non the Laws of England, 24. Similarly, if he becomes \u201cmad\u201d after pleading, he\nshould not be tried, \u201cfor how can he make his defense?\u201d Id.\n       {\u00b6 46} The Supreme Court has long held that convicting a defendant while\nhe is legally incompetent violates the United States Constitution. \u201c[T]he conviction\nof an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process, and * * *\nstate procedures must be adequate to protect this right.\u201d Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S.\n375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), citing Bishop v. United States, 350\nU.S. 961, 76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835 (1956).\n       {\u00b6 47} R.C. 2945.37, which was first enacted in 1978, see Am.Sub.H.B. No.\n565, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2937, 2943-2946, sets forth the process that a\ndefendant is due when an issue is raised pertaining to his competency. R.C.\n2945.37(B) states:\n\n\n               In a criminal action * * *, the court, prosecutor, or defense\n       may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. If\n       the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\n       hold a hearing on the issue * * *. If the issue is raised after the trial\n       has commenced, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for\n       good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion.\n\n\n               2. What Triggers a Trial Court\u2019s Duty to Inquire?\n       {\u00b6 48} A defendant is rebuttably presumed to be competent to stand trial.\nState v. Barton, 108 Ohio St.3d 402, 2006-Ohio-1324, 844 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 56, citing\nR.C. 2945.37(G). \u201c[A] competency determination is necessary only when a court\nhas reason to doubt the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 401, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321, fn. 13.\n       {\u00b6 49} Over 60 years ago, the now well-known test for determining legal\ncompetency to stand trial was announced in Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402,\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960).           Agreeing with the solicitor general\u2019s\nargument, the Supreme Court explained that a trial court must inquire into whether\nthe defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a\nreasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014and whether he has a rational as well\nas factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Id. at 402. This standard\nalso applies when a court is determining a defendant\u2019s competency to plead guilty\nor waive his right to counsel. Godinez at 396, 398-399.\n       {\u00b6 50} We first recognized the Dusky competency test in State v. Chapin,\n67 Ohio St.2d 437, 439-440, 424 N.E.2d 317 (1981), and have continued to apply\nit in the ensuing decades, see State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-\n5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 56 (stating that the Dusky test applies when assessing a\ndefendant\u2019s competency to enter a guilty plea).\n       {\u00b6 51} Due process requires a court to hold a hearing when it has been\npresented with a \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence.\u201d Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S.\n162, 175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). When the issue of competency is\nraised after a defendant\u2019s trial has commenced, R.C. 2945.37(B) directs that \u201cthe\ncourt shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s\nown motion.\u201d We have construed the connotation of the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d to be\n\u201cin accordance with the general principles set forth [by the Supreme Court] in\nDrope and Pate[,383 U.S. at 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815].\u201d State v. Berry,\n72 Ohio St.3d 354, 360, 650 N.E.2d 433 (1995), citing Chapin. Therefore, \u201c[t]he\nright to a hearing on the issue of competency rises to the level of a constitutional\nguarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence\u2019 such that\nan inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competency is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s\nright to a fair trial.\u201d Berry at 359, quoting Drope at 175.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                     3. Analysis\n      a. Were there sufficient indicia of incompetence to require a hearing?\n       {\u00b6 52} Lawson acknowledges that his counsel never asked for a\ncompetency evaluation, but he contends that the trial court denied him due process\nby not ordering one sua sponte. He contends that the record in this case establishes\nsufficient \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d to require a hearing.\n       {\u00b6 53} Three facts, Lawson contends, called his competence into question.\nFirst, his decision to waive a jury trial and plead guilty to the indictment was made\nagainst the advice of his counsel. Second, he displayed \u201cindecision,\u201d in that he\nchanged his mind about pleading guilty. Third, at the time of his plea, he \u201cwas\nbeing treated with psychiatric medications,\u201d a fact he disclosed to the trial court\nduring the plea colloquy.\n       {\u00b6 54} Lawson\u2019s acting against the advice of counsel does not indicate\nincompetence. We have noted that a defendant\u2019s \u201crefusal to heed his counsel\u2019s\nadvice * * * [does] not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the\ncharges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in\nhis defense.\u201d State v. Johnson, 112 Ohio St.3d 210, 858 N.E.2d 1144, 2006-Ohio-\n6404, \u00b6 161. Indeed, such a refusal generally \u201cevidences [the defendant\u2019s] ability\nto participate in his defense.\u201d State v. Fletcher 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 49814, 1985\nWL 4215, *2 (Dec. 5, 1985).\n       {\u00b6 55} Nor does Lawson\u2019s alleged indecision suggest that he was\nincompetent. The record shows that after first expressing his desire to plead guilty\non February 11, 2019, Lawson discussed the matter with his counsel and family\nand then decided not to change his plea. The next day, however, he filed his written\njury waiver. The record does not show that he changed his mind again. On\nFebruary 21, he still wished to plead guilty, and he did so without further hesitation.\n       {\u00b6 56} It is not surprising that a defendant contemplating entering a guilty\nplea in a capital case would display some hesitation. \u201cIndecisiveness is not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsame as incompetency[,] however.\u201d Johnson v. State, 138 Md.App. 539, 567, 772\nA.2d 1260 (2001). And Lawson\u2019s indecision does not amount to irrationality. See\nUnited States v. Miller, 531 F.3d 340, 348 (6th Cir.2008) (in determining\ncompetency, a court is to consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior).\nLawson explained that he changed his mind due to the emotional toll he felt when,\nduring a visit, his mom cried to him about his actions. However, once he distanced\nhimself from those emotions and further reflected, he knew that the best decision\nfor him was to change his not-guilty plea to a plea of guilty.\n       {\u00b6 57} In any event, Lawson\u2019s change of mind was brief. Having decided\nto plead guilty on February 12, he held to his decision in the face of his counsel\u2019s\ncontrary advice and after a rigorous plea colloquy. And he continued to hold to his\ndecision over the ensuing nine days and during the change-of-plea hearing before\nthe three-judge panel. This sequence of events has no tendency to show that\nLawson lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding, nor does it suggest that he was unable to understand the\nproceedings.\n       {\u00b6 58} Finally, Lawson cites his statement during the plea colloquy that he\nwas taking prescription medication. The presiding judge asked Lawson whether he\nwas \u201cpresently under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or mind-altering\nsubstance.\u201d Lawson replied: \u201cI\u2019m under prescription medication, but that is all.\u201d\nHe stated that he was taking naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and Zoloft.\n       {\u00b6 59} However, \u201cit is a matter of statutory and decisional law that \u2018[t]he\nfact that a defendant is taking antidepressant medication or prescribed psychotropic\ndrugs does not negate his competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio\nSt.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 56, quoting State v. Ketterer, 111\nOhio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 71; see also State v. Mink, 101\nOhio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 38; R.C. 2945.37(F) (\u201cThe\ncourt shall not find a defendant incompetent to stand trial solely * * * because the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant is receiving or has received psychotropic drugs or other medication, even\nif the defendant might become incompetent to stand trial without the drugs or\nmedication\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 60} In both Mink and Ketterer, as Lawson points out, \u201ccompetency\nevaluations were conducted * * * before each defendant entered his guilty plea to\ncapital charges.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 54, citing Mink at \u00b6 31-32 and Ketterer at \u00b6 67.\nNevertheless, Mink and Ketterer do not stand for the proposition \u201cthat a court must\norder a competency hearing before accepting a guilty plea from a capital defendant\nwho is taking a prescription medication for mental illness.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)\nMontgomery at \u00b6 54. And in Montgomery, we expressly declined to so hold. Id.\n       {\u00b6 61} Lawson stated during the colloquy that his medications did not\nprevent him from understanding what his attorneys or the court said to him, nor did\nthey affect his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court\nalso asked Lawson if there was any medication that he had been prescribed but was\nnot taking; he said no. Moreover, during the plea colloquy, Lawson \u201cappropriately\nanswered the court\u2019s questions,\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 57, and displayed no\n\u201coutrageous, irrational or confused\u201d behavior, id. at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 62} The presiding judge asked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen\nany indication that Lawson\u2019s medications \u201ccould be affecting his ability to reason\nor [his] judgment.\u201d Both attorneys replied in the negative. \u201cSolemn declarations\nin open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S.\n63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Lawson\u2019s counsel knew that Lawson\nwas taking medication, \u201cyet they had no concerns about his competence.\u201d\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 51. The\nrecord contains no countervailing evidence\u2014nothing to suggest that the\nmedications Lawson was taking could have hampered his ability to understand the\nproceedings or assist his counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 63} Finally, after Lawson informed the court that he was taking\nprescription medication, the trial court conducted a full plea colloquy under\nCrim.R. 11. The panel asked Lawson whether he understood the constitutional\nrights he was waiving by pleading guilty, the consequences of his pleading guilty,\nand the maximum sentence he could potentially receive if found guilty of the capital\nspecifications. The panel had previously verified that he understood the written\nplea of guilty and had executed it with the assistance of his counsel. The panel\nasked Lawson whether he understood each of the charges against him. Lawson\n\u201canswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent\nfashion.\u201d Montgomery at \u00b6 50.\n       {\u00b6 64} Trial counsel\u2019s statements to the trial court are also important in\nconsidering whether the trial court violated Lawson\u2019s due-process rights by failing\nto initiate a competency hearing. \u201cTrial counsel\u2019s assurances to the court are\nrelevant because \u2018a defendant\u2019s counsel is in the best position to evaluate a client\u2019s\ncomprehension of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Stanley v. Cullen, 633 F.3d 852, 861 (9th\nCir.2011), quoting Hernandez v. Ylst, 930 F.2d 714, 718 (9th Cir.1991). The\nSupreme Court has recognized that \u201cjudges must depend to some extent on counsel\nto bring issues into focus.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 176-77, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103. Lawson\u2019s defense counsel never asserted their belief that Lawson was\nincompetent. In fact, lead defense counsel stated just the opposite.         Counsel\nindicated that the trial court was correct in declining to order a competency\nevaluation. He told the court that he had spent \u201cmany hours\u201d with Lawson over a\n17-month period and had discussed Lawson\u2019s competence with Dr. Stinson, and\nlead defense counsel expressly stated that he had \u201cno reason to think\u201d that Lawson\nwas incompetent to enter a guilty plea. \u201c[W]hen a trial court must decide whether\nto hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, reviewing courts\n\u2018give weight * * * to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the defendant.\u2019 \u201d State\nv. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298 (1999), quoting Commonwealth\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nv. Hall, 15 Mass.App. 1, 3, 443 N.E.2d 121 (1982). In this case, the presiding judge\nhad observed Lawson\u2019s in-court demeanor for months and was able to observe his\ndemeanor during the plea colloquy. Indeed, \u201cit is noteworthy that nobody on the\nspot thought [Lawson\u2019s] behavior raised any question as to his competence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Cowans at 84; accord State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-\nOhio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 63; Montgomery at \u00b6 59.\n       {\u00b6 65} Under all the circumstances here, the facts that Lawson cites as\nindicia of incompetence were insufficient to overcome the general presumption of\ncompetence and were insufficient to entitle him to a competency evaluation.\n               b. Did the trial court raise the issue of competency?\n       {\u00b6 66} Lawson contends that \u201cthe [trial] court itself effectively raised the\nissue\u201d of his competence\u2014presumably on February 11, 2019, when the court\nwondered out loud whether it should have ordered a competency hearing earlier in\nthe case over the defense\u2019s objections. Lawson relies on State v. Bock, 28 Ohio\nSt.3d 108, 110, 502 N.E.2d 1016 (1986), in which this court stated: \u201c[T]here is no\nquestion that where the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is raised\nprior to the trial, a competency hearing is mandatory.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.37(B).\nLawson\u2019s argument is not clear, but he seems to imply that a competency hearing\nwas required under Bock because the trial court itself had \u201craised\u201d the issue of\ncompetence.\n       {\u00b6 67} We disagree. While a trial court may raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency, see R.C. 2945.37(B), the trial court in this case was not exercising this\nauthority. In essence, the trial court was asking the defense whether it wanted a\ncompetency hearing. Asking the defense whether it wants a hearing does not by\nitself make a hearing mandatory. The fact that the trial court did not order a\ncompetency evaluation and hearing, when it had the authority to sua sponte do so,\nshows that the court did not intend to raise the issue of Lawson\u2019s competence.\nMoreover, even if a competency hearing were mandatory under Bock, the failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nhold one would be harmless error in this case: \u201c[I]t is clear that the failure to hold\na mandatory competency hearing is harmless error where the record fails to reveal\nsufficient indicia of incompetency.\u201d Bock at 110.\n                    4. No support for the dissent\u2019s per se rule\n        {\u00b6 68} As set forth above, the Supreme Court has established, and Ohio has\nadopted, specific procedures to adequately protect an incompetent defendant from\nbeing tried or convicted. The dissent, however, advocates for the adoption of a per\nse rule\u2014that a competency examination and hearing are required at the instant in\nwhich a capital defendant pursues an adverse-interest request, such as entering a\nplea of guilty.\n        {\u00b6 69} There is no compelling reason to adopt that per se rule. As the Fifth\nCircuit has held:\n\n\n        [W]e decline to adopt a per se rule that, as a matter of law, a trial\n        court must doubt a capital punishment defendant\u2019s competency, or\n        conclude that such defendant does not understand the proceedings\n        against him or appreciate their significance, or conclude that he\n        cannot rationally aid his attorney in his defense simply because it is\n        obvious to the court that the defendant is causing his trial to be\n        conducted in a manner most likely to result in a conviction and the\n        imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\nRoberts v. Dretke, 381 F.3d 491, 498 (5th Cir.2004).\n        {\u00b6 70} A per se rule is also incongruous with the Supreme Court\u2019s position\nthat there is no one sign that triggers the need for a competency evaluation.\n\n\n        [E]vidence of a defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, his demeanor at\n        trial, and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required, but\n       that even one of these factors standing alone may, in some\n       circumstances, be sufficient. There are, of course, no fixed or\n       immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further\n       inquiry to determine fitness to proceed; the question is often a\n       difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle\n       nuances are implicated.        That they are difficult to evaluate is\n       suggested by the varying opinions trained psychiatrists can entertain\n       on the same facts.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) Drope, 420 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103.\n       {\u00b6 71} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Lawson\u2019s first proposition of\nlaw.\n III. VALIDITY OF LAWSON\u2019S JURY WAIVER AND GUILTY PLEAS\n       {\u00b6 72} In his second proposition of law, Lawson contends that both his jury\nwaiver and his subsequent guilty pleas were invalid because they were not knowing,\nvoluntary, and intelligent. This proposition essentially restates the claims made in\nhis first proposition of law; the same three circumstances that the first proposition\ncalls \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d are here relied upon as reasons to question the\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent character of his jury waiver and guilty pleas.\nLawson also argues that before accepting his waiver and pleas, the trial court should\nhave advised him that a single juror could prevent a death sentence. For the reasons\nthat follow, we reject both claims.\n                               A. The Jury Waiver\n       {\u00b6 73} \u201cIn addition to determining that a defendant who seeks to plead\nguilty * * * is competent, a trial court must satisfy itself that the waiver of his\nconstitutional rights is knowing and voluntary.\u201d Godinez, 509 U.S. at 400, 113\nS.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321. The United States Supreme Court has explained the\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\ndistinction between a competency determination and an inquiry into the knowing\nand voluntary character of a rights waiver as follows:\n\n\n               The focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant\u2019s mental\n       capacity; the question is whether he has the ability to understand the\n       proceedings. * * * The purpose of the \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d\n       inquiry, by contrast, is to determine whether the defendant actually\n       does understand the significance and consequences of a particular\n       decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 401, fn. 12, quoting Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 28, 113\nS.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).\n       {\u00b6 74} A jury waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. E.g.,\nState v. Ruppert, 54 Ohio St.2d 263, 271, 375 N.E.2d 1250 (1978). Waiver may\nnot be presumed from a silent record; however, if the record shows that a jury\nwaiver occurred, the verdict will not be set aside except on a plain showing that the\nwaiver was not freely and intelligently made. Adams v. United States ex rel.\nMcCann, 317 U.S. 269, 281, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). Moreover, a\nwritten waiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. United States\nv. Sammons, 918 F.2d 592, 597 (6th Cir.1990). See generally State v. Bays, 87\nOhio St.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126 (1999).\n       {\u00b6 75} In this case, Lawson executed and filed a written jury waiver.\nAttached to the waiver was the following certification by defense counsel:\n\n\n               We, the undersigned, as counsel for defendant Arron\n       Lawson, have consulted with our client, explained his Constitutional\n       rights to a trial by jury, and made inquiry to determine if his decision\n       * * * was based upon any promises or coercive tactics * * * and\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        explained to him the process of trial by three-judge panel. We find\n        no evidence of any promises or coercive tactics * * *. We recognize\n        that his waiver of jury trial is voluntary. And we believe his waiver\n        is knowingly and intelligently made.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 76} By itself, the fact that a defendant is taking prescription medications\n\u201cdoes not defeat the presumption that his written waiver was knowing, intelligent,\nand voluntary.\u201d Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d\n180, at \u00b6 30. Lawson points to nothing to show \u201cthat he, in fact, failed to understand\nthe waiver proceedings or the effect of his decision to waive\u2014or that his decision\nwas somehow involuntary\u2014because of the prescription medications.\u201d Id.\n                                B. The Guilty Pleas\n        {\u00b6 77} \u201cPrior to accepting a guilty plea from a criminal defendant, the trial\ncourt must inform the defendant that he is waiving his privilege against compulsory\nself-incrimination, his right to jury trial, his right to confront his accusers, and his\nright of compulsory process of witnesses.\u201d State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473,\n423 N.E.2d 115 (1981), paragraph one of the syllabus, following Boykin v.\nAlabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242-243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); see also\nCrim.R. 11(C)(2)(c).\n        {\u00b6 78} In this case, the trial court complied with Ballard and Crim.R.\n11(C)(2)(c) by informing Lawson that his guilty plea waived his rights to confront\nthe state\u2019s witnesses, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to require the state\nto prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial in which he would have had the\nright not to testify against himself.\n        {\u00b6 79} Lawson initiated the decision to plead guilty, \u201cinsisted upon it\nagainst advice of counsel, and held to it through a lengthy plea colloquy,\u201d State v.\nFitzpatrick, 102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 40. In\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nFitzpatrick, this court concluded on similar facts that it was \u201cclear\u201d that a capital\ndefendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was voluntary. Id.\n        {\u00b6 80} Nevertheless, Lawson contends that his plea was not voluntary,\nknowing, and intelligent, because (1) the trial court did not inquire into why he was\nnot following counsel\u2019s advice, (2) the trial court did not inquire more deeply into\nthe nature and effects of the medications Lawson was taking, and (3) the trial court\naccepted the waiver and pleas without a hearing on Lawson\u2019s competence.\n        {\u00b6 81} Lawson argues that when a defendant chooses, contrary to his\ncounsel\u2019s advice, to waive a jury trial or plead guilty, the trial court has a duty to\ninquire into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s decision. But he cites no authority for\nthat position.\n        {\u00b6 82} The decisions whether to waive a jury trial and whether to plead\nguilty belong to the defendant, not counsel. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745,\n751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). A defendant\u2019s election to exercise his\nright to reject his counsel\u2019s advice does not imply that his decision could not have\nbeen knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. To draw such an inference would negate\nthe defendant\u2019s right to decide these matters for himself.\n        {\u00b6 83} Lawson also asserts that his decision to reject counsel\u2019s advice was\n\u201cessentially\u201d equivalent to waiving the right to counsel altogether. We reject this\nassertion; there is an obvious difference between Lawson\u2019s situation\u2014having the\nassistance of counsel, but rejecting counsel\u2019s advice\u2014and having no counsel at all.\n        {\u00b6 84} Lawson also argues that the trial court failed to conduct a sufficient\ninquiry into the prescription drugs he was taking. He contends that the trial court\nshould have asked what the medications were for, who prescribed them, how long\nLawson had been taking them, when he had taken them last, and what effects they\nmay have had on his mental state.\n        {\u00b6 85} Lawson cites Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, at \u00b6 66, in which this court stated: \u201cAdditional inquiry is necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ninto a defendant\u2019s mental state once a defendant seeking to enter a guilty plea has\nstated that he is under the influence of drugs or medication.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 86} However, in Montgomery, we rejected a similar claim on similar\nfacts. The defendant in Montgomery argued that the three-judge panel inadequately\ninquired \u201cinto the effect, if any, that his prescription medications had on his mental\nstate.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 44.\n        {\u00b6 87} When the presiding judge in Montgomery learned at the jury-waiver\nhearing that the defendant was taking prescription medications for mental illness,\nthe judge asked \u201cwhether he had been prescribed the medications and whether he\nwas taking them pursuant to the prescription.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 49. The judge also \u201cdirectly\nasked him whether he understood the constitutional rights he was forgoing by\nwaiving his right to a jury, whether he was doing so voluntarily, and whether his\ncounsel had reviewed the jury waiver with him prior to the hearing.\u201d Id. The panel\nlater conducted a plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and \u201cMontgomery\nanswered each of the panel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion.\u201d\nId. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 88} Moreover, \u201c[t]he panel had no reason to believe that Montgomery\nhad any issues with competence or could not intelligently and voluntarily enter a\nguilty plea.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47. Neither the defendant nor counsel in Montgomery \u201cever\nmade any representation to the court that he had any * * * issues with competency.\u201d\nId. The panel specifically asked at the plea hearing\n\n\n        whether [defense counsel] had any reason to believe that\n        [Montgomery] was not competent or capable of voluntarily and\n        intelligently pleading guilty. Defense counsel * * * were aware that\n        Montgomery was medicated for depression, yet they * * * never\n        raised an issue to the court about Montgomery\u2019s ability to\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        understand the proceedings and enter a knowing and voluntary\n        guilty plea.\n\n\nId. at \u00b6 51.\n        {\u00b6 89} In the end, \u201cthere [was] no evidence * * * that Montgomery was not\nin full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point during the\npendency of his case.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180,\nat \u00b6 52. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cthe panel\u2019s inquiry into Montgomery\u2019s\nmental state and use of prescription medications and in its acceptance of\nMontgomery\u2019s guilty plea was adequate and that Montgomery voluntarily and\nknowingly pleaded guilty to capital murder.\u201d Id.\n        {\u00b6 90} The facts of this case closely parallel those of Montgomery. During\nthe plea colloquy, the trial court asked Lawson whether his medications prevented\nhim from understanding what his attorneys or the court told him and whether they\naffected his ability to fully and adequately assist his attorneys. The trial court also\nasked Lawson\u2019s counsel whether they had seen any indication that Lawson\u2019s\nmedications were affecting his reasoning ability or judgment. Neither Lawson nor\nhis counsel indicated at any point \u201cthat he had any * * * issues with competency,\u201d\nMontgomery at \u00b6 47. Moreover, as in Montgomery, the panel in this case conducted\na plea colloquy that complied with Crim.R. 11, and Lawson \u201canswered each of the\npanel\u2019s questions in the affirmative and in a coherent fashion,\u201d id. at \u00b6 50.\n        {\u00b6 91} \u201cIn short, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that [Lawson]\nwas not in full possession of his faculties at the plea hearing or at any other point\nduring the pendency of his case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 52. \u201c[C]onsidering the totality of the\nevidence,\u201d id., the panel\u2019s inquiry into Lawson\u2019s mental state and use of\nprescription medications was sufficient to comply with Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350,\n2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n      C. Failure to Advise that Single Juror Can Block Death Sentence\n        {\u00b6 92} Lawson contends that his jury waiver and guilty pleas were not\nvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent because the trial court did not tell him that a\nsingle juror can block a death sentence. However, we have rejected that contention.\nMontgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, at \u00b6 30, citing\nBays, 87 Ohio St.3d at 19-21, 716 N.E.2d 1126; see also Fitzpatrick, 102 Ohio\nSt.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 NE.2d 927, at \u00b6 42-48; Sowell v.

INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        {\u00b6 93} In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance. To establish ineffective assistance, Lawson must\nshow (1) deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective\nstandard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been\ndifferent. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052,\n80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989),\nparagraphs two and three of the syllabus.\n                A. Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation\n        {\u00b6 94} Lawson argues that his counsel should have requested a competency\nevaluation, which would have led to a competency hearing.\n        {\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.37(B) entitles the defense to a pretrial competency\nhearing upon request: \u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas, * * * the\ncourt, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to\nstand trial. If the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\nhold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense\ncounsel is not ineffective in failing to request that the trial court order a competency\nevaluation or hold a competency hearing when the defendant does not display\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. State v.\nThomas, 97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 96} Lawson contends that counsel\u2019s decision not to request a\ncompetency evaluation cannot be justified as a strategic decision, because\nrequesting an evaluation would have had no possible \u201cdownside.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 97} Lawson\u2019s assertion that there is no downside to requesting a\ncompetency evaluation in this type of situation is questionable: defense counsel\nmay risk straining their relationship with their client when they question his mental\ncompetence and seek to negate his decisions. But in any event, competent counsel\nwould not request an evaluation unless they had some reason to doubt the\ndefendant\u2019s competence. Here, nothing in the record shows that Lawson\u2019s counsel\nhad any such reason.\n       {\u00b6 98} Lawson contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate the\ncompetency issue before declining to request a competency evaluation. He argues\nthat an expert opinion on Lawson\u2019s competence was essential, because counsel\u2019s\n\u201carmchair opinions\u201d were not a sufficient basis on which to make such a decision.\nHe further argues that the record fails to show that defense counsel ever sought an\nexpert opinion.\n       {\u00b6 99} Lawson points to defense counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court on\nFebruary 11, 2019, the day Lawson first announced that he wanted to waive a jury\nand plead guilty. One of the prosecutors asked whether Dr. Stinson could render\nan opinion on competence based on conversations Dr. Stinson and Lawson had\nalready had. One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied:\n\n\n               I can\u2019t commit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that. I know\n       psychologists that I have worked with in the past would probably\n       say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a completely different review and assessment,\u201d\n       and they\u2019re looking for different things than the context of\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       presenting possible psychological information for purposes of\n       mitigation.\n               Obviously [Dr. Stinson] would have more familiarity with\n       this young man than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be\n       done in a manner, although I * * * haven\u2019t thought through whether\n       that would create some sort of a conflict in terms of what his\n       testimony would be in the mitigation phase.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Lawson reads this statement as indicating \u201cthe limited scope of Dr.\nStinson\u2019s services[,] which did not include a competency examination.\u201d But\ndefense counsel did not say that Dr. Stinson could not render such an assessment.\nHe said only that he could not guarantee that Dr. Stinson would be able to form an\nopinion of Lawson\u2019s competence based on the interviewing Dr. Stinson had done\nup to that point. Indeed, counsel went on to say that Dr. Stinson \u201cwould have more\nfamiliarity with [Lawson] than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be done\nin a manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n       {\u00b6 101} Lawson goes on to assert that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that\nindicates that Dr. Stinson or any other mental health professional did, or was even\nasked to do, a competency evaluation on\u201d Lawson. Lawson\u2019s argument misplaces\nthe burden of persuasion: a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal must show from the record that the elements of the claim\nexist. Therefore, Lawson must show that his counsel failed to perform an adequate\ninvestigation of his possible incompetence. See, e.g., State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d\n448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 244.\n       {\u00b6 102} Lawson also ignores what defense counsel said during the plea\nhearing on February 21. During that hearing, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys expressly\nstated that counsel had conducted an investigation into competency issues and that\nthey had consulted Dr. Stinson:\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n               JUDGE BALLARD: * * * [A]t any point did you ever have\n       any concerns that might be raised by Adkins [sic, Atkins v. Virginia,\n       536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002)], or any\n       mental defect or mental deficiency that could have been identified\n       in Mr. Lawson that would have prevented him from knowingly and\n       intelligently and voluntarily entering into this plea waiver?\n               MR. MCVAY [defense counsel]: Not being a psychologist\n       or a psychiatrist * * * I\u2019m not in a position * * * to technically\n       answer that. But based on my many years of experience and 24\n       years as a practicing attorney handling a substantial number of death\n       penalty cases * * * and having had clients who would be Adkins-\n       qualified or otherwise incompetent to enter a plea, * * * I have no\n       reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of those\n       categories at this point in time based upon my discussions with him\n       and many hours spent with him, over 17 months, as well as the time\n       spent with him today.\n\n\n(Capitalization sic.)\n       {\u00b6 103} The presiding judge then asked counsel: \u201c[I]s it safe for this panel\nto assume that you conducted appropriate investigation from your practice into any\nissue that would be addressed by Adkins or mental issues or competency issues?\u201d\nCounsel replied:\n\n\n               We did, your Honor. In keeping with the American Bar\n       Association Guidelines for the Representation of Defendants\n       Charged with Capital Crimes and their recommendation, if not\n       insistence, that we engage a forensic psychologist to work with and\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       examine the defendant in the course of our representation, * * * that\n       in fact has been done. * * *\n               Having said that, and having discussed matters with * * *\n       Dr. Stinson at length, I think I can fairly represent that by virtue of\n       the fact that we have not filed any pleadings pertaining to a possible\n       incompetency to proceed in this matter * * *, I feel that we\u2019re on\n       safe ground in that respect in the sense that we have done our due\n       diligence with regard to that * * *. We have looked into all of those\n       matters, discussed most, * * * I would suggest all of those matters\n       with Mr. Lawson. I believe that we\u2019re on solid ground to move\n       forward with what his intentions are at this point in time.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) This statement indicates that Dr. Stinson examined Lawson and\nthat defense counsel consulted Dr. Stinson in determining whether to further pursue\nthe issue of Lawson\u2019s competence. Lawson cites nothing in the record that either\ncontradicts counsel\u2019s representations or shows that the investigation that had been\nconducted was deficient.\n       {\u00b6 104} Finally, Lawson is unable to show prejudice resulting from\ncounsel\u2019s declining to request a competency evaluation. It is true that if Lawson\u2019s\ncounsel had requested an evaluation, the trial court would have been required by\nstatute to order one.   But that says nothing about the likely outcome of the\nevaluation and of the hearing. To show prejudice, Lawson must show that there is\na reasonable probability that an evaluation \u201cwould have revealed that he was\nincompetent to stand trial,\u201d Alexander v. Dugger, 841 F.2d 371, 375 (11th\nCir.1988).\n       {\u00b6 105} As we concluded in relation to Lawson\u2019s first proposition of law,\nthe record simply contains insufficient indicia of incompetence to require a\ncompetency evaluation or a competency hearing. If defense counsel had requested\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\na competency evaluation, the trial court would have had to hold a hearing. But the\nalleged indicia of incompetence that Lawson repeatedly cites would have been\ninsufficient to overcome the legal presumption of competence, because they do not\nsuggest that Lawson was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the\nproceedings against him or of assisting in his own defense. The record of the\npenalty phase contains numerous references to Lawson\u2019s mental-health history,\nincluding diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, and posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). However, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere\nmental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be\nemotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the\ncharges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 110, 502\nN.E.2d 1016. Accordingly, the record does not show a reasonable likelihood that\nthe trial court would have found Lawson incompetent to stand trial.\n              B. Failure to Argue Mercy As a Mitigating Factor\n       {\u00b6 106} In another part of his third proposition of law, Lawson contends\nthat his counsel were ineffective because they failed to renew a pretrial motion to\ninstruct the jury on mercy as a mitigating factor and because they did not argue\nduring the penalty phase that mercy was a mitigating factor.\n       {\u00b6 107} As the state points out, any issues concerning jury instructions\nbecame moot once Lawson waived a jury trial. However, Lawson also contends\nthat counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue before the three-\njudge panel that mercy is a mitigating factor. That facet of his claim is obviously\nnot rendered moot by Lawson\u2019s jury waiver.\n       {\u00b6 108} However, the claim lacks merit, as we have repeatedly held that\nmercy is not a mitigating factor. See, e.g., State v. Belton, 149 Ohio St.3d 165,\n2016-Ohio-1581, 74 N.E.3d 319, \u00b6 88; State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-\nOhio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955, \u00b6 253. Hence, counsel did not perform deficiently by\ndeclining to argue otherwise.     \u201cDefense counsel is not required to advance\n\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\narguments lacking merit. * * * It is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to\nmaneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested or rejected legal\ntheories.\u201d State v. McNeill, 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 449, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998).\n       {\u00b6 109} Lawson also fails to show prejudice. Defense counsel in this case\npresented extensive mitigating evidence focused on Lawson\u2019s dysfunctional family\nand upbringing, his alleged abuse, traumatic events in his life, and his diagnosed\nmental disorders. Their penalty-phase arguments to the panel concentrated on that\nevidence. Lawson does not explain how adding an express plea for mercy would\nhave been reasonably likely to make a difference in the penalty-phase outcome.\n       {\u00b6 110} We overrule Lawson\u2019s third proposition of law.\n                          V. SENTENCING OPINION\n       {\u00b6 111} In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the\npanel\u2019s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends\nthat the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against\nhim and improperly discounted the mitigating factors. We disagree.\n                 A. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s 12-page sentencing opinion begins with a\nstatement of facts. According to Lawson, the opinion includes several facts that\n\u201cmade the crime particularly disturbing\u201d and could only \u201cbe termed as\ninflammatory.\u201d Lawson contends that by mentioning these facts in the opinion, the\npanel \u201cemployed\u201d them as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\n       {\u00b6 113} The \u201cinflammatory\u201d facts Lawson refers to include the following:\nthat Lawson had sexual intercourse with Stacey\u2019s body after shooting her, that\nStacey had recently ended a sexual relationship with Lawson, that Lawson posed\nas D.H.\u2019s father to deceive D.H.\u2019s school into sending him home that day, that\nLawson \u201ctricked\u201d D.H. into entering the bedroom and shot him twice at close range,\nthat Lawson prepared in advance for the murders by propping a window open the\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nnight before, that he moved and covered the bodies, and that he was arrested two\ndays later \u201c[a]fter a manhunt.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 114} But a trial court does not \u201ccreate nonstatutory aggravating\ncircumstances\u201d merely by \u201cdiscussing the facts of the crime.\u201d State v. Robb, 88\nOhio St.3d 59, 82, 723 N.E.2d 1019 (2000). Moreover, the sentencing opinion here\ncorrectly identified the aggravating circumstances of which Lawson was found\nguilty as to each aggravated-murder count. When a trial court has correctly\nidentified the statutory aggravating circumstances pleaded and proved at trial, we\npresume that the trial court understood the difference between statutory aggravating\ncircumstances and the facts that describe the nature and circumstances of the\noffense. State v. Martin, 151 Ohio St.3d 470, 2017-Ohio-7556, 90 N.E.3d 857,\n\u00b6 137.\n         {\u00b6 115} Lawson points to nothing in the opinion that suggests that the panel\nused the facts as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Instead, he contends that\nthe opinion fails to affirmatively state that the facts were not so used, and he argues\nthat this failure suffices to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only\nthe aggravating circumstances to which Lawson pleaded guilty. However, the\nopinion does specifically state that the panel did not consider Lawson\u2019s alleged\naffair with Stacey or the other \u201coffenses charged in the indictment,\u201d which would\ninclude his abuse of Stacey\u2019s corpse, as aggravating circumstances.\n         {\u00b6 116} Lawson\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our precedent.             The\nopinion \u201cidentified only the applicable statutory aggravating circumstances * * *\nand listed no improper nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.              Therefore,\n[Lawson] has not rebutted the presumption that the court relied only upon the\naggravating circumstances it identified.\u201d State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio St.3d 175,\n2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, \u00b6 121.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n            B. Unconsidered or Improperly Discounted Mitigation\n        {\u00b6 117} Lawson also contends that the panel\u2019s sentencing opinion \u201ccontains\nweighing errors\u201d that violate the Eighth Amendment as construed in Lockett v.\nOhio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion),\nand Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The\nUnited States Supreme Court in Eddings held that the sentencer in a capital case\nmay not \u201crefuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d\n(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 114. Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider\nsome mitigating factors and gave too little weight to others.\n        {\u00b6 118} Lawson contends that the trial court failed to consider Dr. Stinson\u2019s\ntestimony bearing on the mitigating factor of Lawson\u2019s youth, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\nBecause Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the murders, the trial court\ngave little weight to this factor. However, the sentencing opinion does not discuss\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony that the human brain does not finish developing until a\nperson reaches his mid-20s; in particular, Dr. Stinson testified that this is true of the\nfrontal lobe, which is responsible for \u201cjudgment, reasoning, impulse control, [and]\nplanning.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s opinion does not discuss this testimony,\nLawson asks us to infer that the panel did not consider it.\n        {\u00b6 119} But \u201c[w]hile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of\nmitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio\nSt.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). A trial court\u2019s failure to discuss each\nmitigating factor in its opinion does not give rise to an automatic inference that\nfactors that were not discussed in the opinion were not considered. Obermiller, 147\nOhio St.3d 175, 2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, at \u00b6 125, citing State v. Roberts,\n137 Ohio St.3d 230, 2013-Ohio-4580, 998 N.E.2d 1100, \u00b6 54.\n        {\u00b6 120} Such an inference is warranted only in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d\nRoberts at \u00b6 64, and Lawson points to no such circumstances here. In Roberts, the\ndefendant\u2019s allocution contained \u201cpotentially significant mitigation,\u201d id., and \u201cwas\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthe only relevant matter * * * specifically placed before the trial court as\nmitigation\u201d (emphasis sic), id. at \u00b6 56; in those circumstances, the trial court\u2019s\nfailure to mention the allocution in the sentencing opinion warranted the inference\nthat the court had failed to consider the allocution.       But in this case, as in\nObermiller, the sentencing opinion \u201cdiscussed multiple mitigating factors,\u201d\nObermiller at \u00b6 126. Therefore, the inference that the trial court failed to consider\nDr. Stinson\u2019s testimony is not justified.\n       {\u00b6 121} Lawson also contends that the trial court erred by \u201cunreasonably\ndiscount[ing]\u201d or giving \u201cinsufficient consideration to\u201d his mitigating evidence\ngoing to various other factors\u2014i.e., assigning it no weight or insufficient weight.\nLawson contends that a trial court violates the holding in Eddings and the Eighth\nAmendment by assigning insufficient weight to a defendant\u2019s mitigation.\n       {\u00b6 122} As we have explained, this reading of Eddings is incorrect because,\nas stated in Harris v. Alabama, 513 U.S. 504, 512, 115 S.Ct. 1031, 130 L.Ed.2d\n1004 (1995), \u201cthe Constitution does not require a State to ascribe any specific\nweight to particular factors, either in aggravation or mitigation, to be considered by\nthe sentencer.\u201d The weight to be given to any mitigating factor is \u201c \u2018an individual\ndecision by the fact finder,\u2019 \u201d not a matter of law. State v. Davis, 139 Ohio St.3d\n122, 2014-Ohio-1615, 9 N.E.3d 1031, \u00b6 62, quoting State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d\n353, 369-370, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992), abrogated in part on other grounds, see\nState v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 402-403, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997).\n       {\u00b6 123} Quoting Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 42, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175\nL.Ed.2d 398 (2009), Lawson describes it as a case in which the United States\nSupreme Court held that a state supreme court \u201c \u2018either did not consider or\nunreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence\u2019 adduced in a post-conviction\nhearing.\u201d   But \u201cPorter does not stand for the proposition that the Eighth\nAmendment forbids a sentencer to \u2018discount\u2019 mitigating evidence introduced at the\npenalty phase of the trial.\u201d Davis at \u00b6 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 124} Therefore, we overrule Lawson\u2019s fourth proposition of law.\n                             VI. SETTLED ISSUES\n       {\u00b6 125} Lawson\u2019s fifth proposition of law raises various oft-rejected\narguments against the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes\ngoverning its imposition and also raises similar arguments that the death penalty\nviolates international law. See, e.g., State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-\nOhio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 106, 109-120; State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164,\n169-174, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984). We summarily overrule this proposition of law.\nSee generally State v. Poindexter, 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568 (1988),\nsyllabus; State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St.3d 80, 81, 521 N.E.2d 800 (1988).\n                 VII. INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW\n       {\u00b6 126} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Lawson\u2019s\ndeath sentences. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine (1) whether the\nevidence supports the trier of fact\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, (2)\nwhether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty\noutweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) whether the\ndeath sentences are proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.\n                        A. Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 127} The aggravated murder of Stacey Holston (Count 1) has two\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)), and a felony-\nmurder circumstance predicated on aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)).\n       {\u00b6 128} The aggravated murder of D.H. (Count 2) has five aggravating\ncircumstances: murder of a victim under age 13 (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)); murder\ncommitted to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another\noffense (R.C 2929.04(A)(3)); course of conduct; felony murder predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder predicated on kidnapping.\n       {\u00b6 129} The aggravated murder of Tammie McGuire (Count 3) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 130} The aggravated murder of Donald McGuire (Count 4) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 131} The evidence in the record, including Lawson\u2019s confession,\nsupports the panel\u2019s finding as to each of the aggravating circumstances.\n                              B. Mitigating Factors\n       {\u00b6 132} Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh any of the\nrelevant mitigating factors provided in R.C. 2929.04(B). These factors include\n\u2022      the nature and circumstances of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      the history, character, and background of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it, R.C.\n       2929.04(B)(1),\n\u2022      whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for\n       the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation,\n       R.C. 2929.04(B)(2),\n\u2022      whether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a\n       mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the\n       criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct\n       to the requirements of the law, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3),\n\u2022      the youth of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4),\n\u2022      the offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and\n       delinquency adjudications, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5),\n\u2022      if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\n       the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim,\n          R.C. 2929.04(B)(6),\n\u2022         and any other factors that are relevant to the issue whether the offender\n          should be sentenced to death, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\n                                         1. Age\n          {\u00b6 133} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), \u201c[t]he youth of the offender\u201d is a\nmitigating factor. Lawson was born in 1994 and was 23 years old when he\ncommitted these murders. Lawson\u2019s age \u201cqualifies as a mitigating factor under\nR.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\u201d State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842\nN.E.2d 996, \u00b6 195.\n          {\u00b6 134} In the penalty phase, Lawson presented testimony from Dr.\nStinson, a forensic psychologist.       Dr. Stinson testified that the human brain\ncontinues to develop until a person reaches his mid-20s. He specifically noted that\nthe frontal lobe\u2014which is responsible for things like judgment, reasoning, impulse\ncontrol, and planning\u2014is the last part of the brain to develop and does not reach\nfull development until the mid-20s.\n                                2. Prior Criminal History\n          {\u00b6 135} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), \u201c[t]he offender\u2019s lack of a significant\nhistory of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications\u201d is a mitigating\nfactor.    The trial court found that Lawson has no previous convictions or\ndelinquency adjudications.\n                             3. Mental Disease or Defect\n          {\u00b6 136} The diminished-capacity mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), is\ninapplicable. Although Lawson has been diagnosed with various mental disorders,\nincluding bipolar disorder, Dr. Stinson did not testify that any of them deprived him\nof \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform\n[his] conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). The other\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nmitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B) that are not addressed in this opinion\nare likewise inapplicable.\n                     4. History, Character, and Background\n       {\u00b6 137} Lawson\u2019s history, character, and background constituted the heart\nof his case in mitigation. In the penalty phase, Lawson presented three witnesses:\nCarolyn Taylor, Stephanie Bentley, and Dr. Stinson. Carolyn Taylor is Lawson\u2019s\nmother. Stephanie Bentley is his half-sister and Carolyn\u2019s daughter. Dr. Stinson\ninterviewed Lawson for a total of 12 hours during four sessions and also\ninterviewed Lawson\u2019s mother. He reviewed information obtained by a mitigation\nspecialist who had conducted interviews of Lawson, his mother, his stepmother\nMartha Lawson, his half-sisters Stephanie Bentley and Summer Riesner, and others\nfamiliar with Lawson and his family. Dr. Stinson reviewed children\u2019s services,\neducational, employment, medical, mental-health, and jail records pertaining to\nLawson, records pertaining to Carolyn Taylor\u2019s family background and upbringing,\nand other records.\n       {\u00b6 138} Dr. Stinson identified 11 \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d\n(\u201cACEs\u201d) that place a child at risk for adverse health, mental-health, and social\noutcomes. They are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical\nneglect, emotional neglect, \u201cintimate partner violence,\u201d violence against the\nmother, \u201csubstance misuse in the household,\u201d parental divorce or separation,\nmental illness of a household member, and the incarceration of a household\nmember. Dr. Stinson testified that a research study conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention found that ACEs relate to approximately 40\nnegative outcomes. The presence of four or five ACEs indicates \u201csignificantly\nincreased risk for negative outcomes,\u201d and the likelihood of negative outcomes\nrises with the number of ACEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 139} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson had experienced \u201cat least\u201d nine\nACEs. The only two Dr. Stinson failed to definitively find were sexual abuse and\nphysical neglect.\n         {\u00b6 140} Lawson was born in April 1994. His parents are Delbert \u201cRay\u201d\nLawson and Carolyn Taylor. He was the third of five children Carolyn had by five\ndifferent men. Both of Lawson\u2019s parents have been divorced and remarried\nmultiple times. Carolyn has lived on welfare, food stamps, and Social Security\ndisability benefits.\n         {\u00b6 141} Ray and Carolyn lived together for about a month; when Carolyn\nbecame pregnant with Lawson, Ray left her. Carolyn lost custody of Lawson in\n1995. Ray denied his paternity until a DNA test proved that he was Lawson\u2019s\nfather; after that, he sought and was awarded custody of Lawson. According to Dr.\nStinson, Martha Lawson recalled that Carolyn had dropped Lawson off at Ray and\nMartha\u2019s house coatless in the middle of a winter night with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nturn.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 142} Lawson lived with Ray and Martha until he was 16. Also living in\nthe Lawson household were Ray and Martha\u2019s son Ray Jr. and Martha\u2019s son James\nMunyon. Carolyn was entitled to visitation with Lawson on Wednesdays and\nalternate weekends.    However, she testified that sometimes Ray and Martha\ndeprived Lawson of a visit as a punishment.\n         {\u00b6 143} While living with Ray and Martha, Lawson was especially close to\nhis paternal aunt, Linda McFann. Carolyn testified that Linda was \u201clike a second\nmom\u201d to him. Unfortunately, Linda died in a house fire. Carolyn testified that\nLawson was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Linda\u2019s death. Dr. Stinson testified that Linda died\nin 2006, when Lawson was about 12 years old. According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson\nstill had not \u201cresolved\u201d his bereavement five years later. At that time, a neighbor\ntold Lawson that he was glad Linda was dead, and Lawson responded by\n\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthreatening the neighbor with a butcher knife. Lawson was hospitalized at a\nmental-health facility after this incident.\n        {\u00b6 144} Lawson was also quite close to the boyfriend of one of his aunts,\nwhom he called \u201cUncle Tracy.\u201d Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Tracy was the most\npositive influence in his life. But Tracy died of a heroin overdose in about 2016.\n        {\u00b6 145} When Lawson was 16, Ray and Martha divorced, and Ray moved\nto Kentucky, leaving his children behind. Custody of Lawson then reverted to\nCarolyn, who had married Carl Kelly. A few months later, Carolyn and Kelly broke\nup, but Lawson continued to live with Kelly, whom Bentley described as like a\nfather to Lawson. Dr. Stinson believed that Kelly was generally a positive influence\non Lawson and may have provided \u201csome positive role modeling.\u201d On the other\nhand, Bentley testified that Kelly sold a lot of marijuana and provided some of it to\nLawson. After moving out, Carolyn maintained contact with Lawson, seeing him\nevery few days and talking to him on the phone.\n        {\u00b6 146} Dr. Stinson described the \u201ccomplicated family structure\u201d within\nwhich Lawson was raised. Ray left Lawson\u2019s mother to marry Martha, and\nLawson\u2019s mother had a relationship with Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon, who was\nthe father of Lawson\u2019s half-sister Stephanie Bentley. Lawson was teased in school\nbecause of this \u201cweird\u201d family situation. Additionally, Lawson\u2019s grandfather\nfathered a child with one of his daughters-in-law (Lawson\u2019s aunt by marriage); that\nchild was referred to as Lawson\u2019s \u201cUncle Cuz\u201d because he was both uncle and\ncousin to Lawson.\n        {\u00b6 147} Since at least age 11, Lawson has repeatedly alleged that his father,\nstepmother, and other family members abused him. He described his father as an\n\u201cabusive asshole\u201d who would get drunk and punch him.\n        {\u00b6 148} Carolyn testified that during visitations, she sometimes saw\nunexplained injuries on Lawson. Once she saw stitches in his head. She said that\nsomeone once squeezed Lawson\u2019s ears so tightly that they were severely bruised\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand had turned black. Bentley remembered seeing this as well, but she never saw\nany other bruising or injures. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Martha would pinch his\nears to the point of bruising and would strike him in the face.\n       {\u00b6 149} On one occasion, Carolyn testified, a dark orange substance was\ndraining from Lawson\u2019s ear. Carolyn recalled that when she took Lawson to a\ndoctor to treat his ear, the doctor said that it looked as if someone had jabbed the\nmetal end of a pencil into Lawson\u2019s ear after removing the eraser.\n       {\u00b6 150} Dr. Stinson testified that according to the medical records he\nreviewed, there were two cases of drainage from Lawson\u2019s ears. The first instance\nof \u201cbloody drainage\u201d occurred when Lawson was three; almost a year later, Lawson\nexperienced the orange discharge that had been described by Carolyn from the same\near.   According to Dr. Stinson, medical records documented that Lawson\u2019s\nstepbrother, James Munyon, had shoved pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears; however, Dr.\nStinson did not make clear whether this behavior had caused the discharges.\n       {\u00b6 151} Dr. Stinson admitted that to his knowledge, no specific instances of\nabuse against Lawson had ever been substantiated. And although Dr. Stinson\nbelieved that Lawson was a victim of abuse, he eventually conceded that he did not\nknow whether Lawson had been abused. (Dr. Stinson did not classify the alleged\ninsertion of pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears as a type of \u201cabuse.\u201d)\n       {\u00b6 152} Dr. Stinson also testified that Lawson reported abuse \u201cover and\nover and over to people who did nothing.\u201d Dr. Stinson felt that the fact that\nLawson\u2019s claims went unheeded was actually \u201cmore relevant\u201d than whether he\nactually was abused, because it contributed to his feelings of being unloved:\n\n\n       We can look back on it and say \u201cWell, it * * * really wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n       From my standpoint what\u2019s more relevant is the fact that once he\n       reported his abuse, nobody did anything about it * * * and he\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       internalized [the belief that] nobody cares, nobody\u2019s going to protect\n       me, nobody loves me and I\u2019m unlovable.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 153} Lawson did tell his mother that he was being abused, and his\nmedical records showed that he reported past abuse to medical-health professionals\nduring his treatment sessions.\n       {\u00b6 154} However, when Lawson first alleged to authorities that he was\nbeing abused, the authorities did not ignore it; they investigated and found no\nevidence to support the claim. The penalty-phase evidence includes records for\nLawson and his family from the Lawrence County Department of Job and Family\nServices that were admitted as a court\u2019s exhibit. Those records include a children\u2019s\nservices report showing that Ray and Martha were investigated in 2006 after\nLawson reported to the Ironton police that he was being abused.\n       {\u00b6 155} According to the records, Lawson alleged that his stepmother\nslapped his face, his siblings \u201cput erasers in his ears,\u201d and his parents \u201chit him\neverywhere.\u201d But the investigator found only one small bruise on Lawson\u2019s knee,\nand that appeared to the investigator to be normal for a preteen child and to not\nhave been deliberately inflicted.\n       {\u00b6 156} The investigator learned that Lawson\u2019s father had recently spanked\nhim with a belt; however, the spanking was inflicted as a punishment after Lawson\nchoked his brother, Ray Jr., during a squabble. Martha told the investigator that\nLawson had expressed a desire \u201cto get his father in trouble like he was in trouble\nfrom choking\u201d his brother.\n       {\u00b6 157} Although Lawson has never reported that he was sexually abused\nand in fact has denied it, Dr. Stinson nonetheless suspected that Lawson may have\nbeen sexually abused as a child. He based this suspicion on the existence of\n\u201crampant\u201d sexual abuse in Lawson\u2019s family over the years. Carolyn\u2019s oldest son\nwas allegedly sexually abused and went on to abuse two sisters and a cousin.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLawson\u2019s stepbrother was sexually abused by a neighbor. One of Lawson\u2019s half-\nsisters was sexually abused by Carolyn\u2019s brother-in-law. A generation before,\nCarolyn\u2019s family members had been involved in numerous allegations of sexual\nabuse. Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson may have denied being sexually abused\nbecause it was so common as to become \u201cnormalized\u201d in his family.\n       {\u00b6 158} Lawson\u2019s mother, Carolyn Taylor, was raised in poverty; her\nfamily was dependent on welfare and food stamps, and the children were\nmalnourished. Carolyn grew up in a trailer that housed 12 people. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that \u201cthere were concerns that the boys and the girls were sharing bedrooms\nand sleeping together.\u201d The home was leaky and roach-infested and had no indoor\nbathroom.\n       {\u00b6 159} During Carolyn\u2019s childhood, numerous allegations of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were leveled against her parents and stepparents;\nmany of them were against her father in particular.             Children\u2019s services\ninvestigators were able to substantiate some of these allegations, but according to\nDr. Stinson, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, Dr. Stinson\ntestified that the \u201cremarkable\u201d number of allegations said a great deal about the\nculture of Carolyn\u2019s family.\n       {\u00b6 160} Dr. Stinson also stated that Carolyn suffered from \u201csignificant\nmental health problems.\u201d Documented symptoms he listed included agitation,\nanhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities), anxiety, crying spells,\ndisorganized thought, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, homicidal and\nsuicidal thoughts, hyperactivity, paranoia, panic attacks, phobic avoidance,\npreoccupation, self-mutilation, and feelings of worthlessness.          Her \u201cmood\ndisturbance\u201d manifested itself in the forms of severe depression, anger, euphoria,\nirritability, mania, and \u201cmixed moods,\u201d i.e., simultaneous symptoms of depression\nand mania.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 161} Dr. Stinson related that Carolyn had been diagnosed with anxiety\ndisorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, \u201cmoderate and recurrent\u201d major depressive\ndisorder, various forms of bipolar disorder including \u201cmixed [simultaneously manic\nand depressive] severe, with psychotic features,\u201d and schizoaffective disorder, a\npsychotic disorder combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She had been\ntreated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. Carolyn\u2019s\ndoctor had determined that her mental disorders left her \u201cfunctionally impaired,\u201d\nunable to carry on day-to-day activities. The Social Security Administration had\nfound that she was \u201cpermanently impaired and unable to engage in any gainful\nactivity.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 162} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson also had three relatives\u2014an\nuncle, aunt, and great-uncle\u2014who had attempted suicide. And Lawson described\na maternal half-brother as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and as having delusions. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that severe mental-health problems have a genetic component, so that the\nchildren of parents with severe mental-health problems are particularly at risk to\ninherit them.\n        {\u00b6 163} Lawson has in fact had mental-health problems and has been\ndiagnosed with mental disorders since childhood. Most significantly, in March\n2011, shortly before he turned 17, Lawson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and\nbipolar disorder. In April of that year, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at\nMercy Franciscan Hospital after a violent incident with his neighbor. Hospital staff\nmembers believed that past abuse had contributed to his emotional difficulties.\n        {\u00b6 164} Lawson continued to receive mental-health evaluations and\ntreatment in 2011 and 2012. During one psychiatric examination, he said he was\nhaving flashbacks to past abuse. In 2012, Lawson was hospitalized again because\nhe was contemplating injuring his neighbor.\n        {\u00b6 165} Since 2011, Lawson has been diagnosed repeatedly with depressive\ndisorder and PTSD. Dr. Stinson testified that when he interviewed Lawson, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nexhibited classic symptoms of depression and PTSD.                 Despite previous\nhospitalizations, Dr. Stinson testified, Lawson did not receive the kind of treatment\nhe needed.\n        {\u00b6 166} Lawson has had anger issues dating back to his childhood. During\nthe 2006 children\u2019s services investigation, the investigating social worker wrote\nthat she was concerned about Lawson\u2019s inability to control his anger. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that Lawson was enrolled in an anger-management class at age 13 because\nhe was unable to regulate his emotions; however, his stepmother removed him\nbecause the class took time away from his chores and homework. At age 16, he\nwas diagnosed with \u201canger disorder.\u201d Dr. Stinson noted that \u201cthere is no such thing\nas anger disorder,\u201d but he interpreted this diagnosis to mean that Lawson had a\nmood disorder in which anger was predominant.\n        {\u00b6 167} A consistent factor in Lawson\u2019s personality has been his repeatedly\nexpressed feelings that he was worthless; he described himself to Dr. Stinson as\nfeeling like \u201cjust a piece of crap\u201d and \u201clike a dog.\u201d Schoolmates made fun of his\nfamily and his first name. (His mother meant to name him \u201cAaron,\u201d but she\nmisspelled it as \u201cArron\u201d on his birth certificate. His preferred pronunciation is \u201cAr-\nron,\u201d with the emphasis on the second syllable, but people frequently mispronounce\nit.)   Bentley testified that Martha favored her own children over Lawson.\nAccording to Dr. Stinson, Lawson used marijuana to deal with feelings of\nemptiness and worthlessness.\n        {\u00b6 168} Lawson\u2019s family has an extensive history of drug and alcohol\nproblems. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that his father, Ray, was \u201cdrunk all the time.\u201d\nBentley testified that Ray drank \u201c[e]very day, all day long.\u201d Carolyn told Dr.\nStinson that Ray was \u201ca real bad drunk.\u201d During the period when Lawson lived\nwith Ray and Martha, Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon was released from prison and\nmoved into the household. Dr. Stinson testified that Munyon not only smoked\nmarijuana but traded it for sex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Despite Lawson\u2019s family history, Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson\nhimself did not have \u201csevere drug and alcohol problems.\u201d But Dr. Stinson stated\nthat Lawson did use marijuana and other drugs to cope with physical pain and\nemotional distress. Bentley testified that Lawson smoked marijuana frequently or\ndaily. Dr. Stinson diagnosed Lawson with a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d but he\nconceded that this disorder caused no major impairment of Lawson\u2019s functioning.\nThere was no evidence that Lawson had been using alcohol or drugs at the time of\nthe aggravated murders in this case.\n       {\u00b6 170} Lawson had numerous medical problems throughout his life.\nWhen he was two, a dog bit him on the cheek, although Carolyn testified that the\ninjury was not serious. At the age of three, he had a laceration to the forehead,\nrequiring stitches, and had skin-cancer surgery. At the age of four, his tongue was\nclipped twice to correct a speech impediment. Both the skin-cancer surgery and\nthe tongue clipping were outpatient procedures. At the age of 12, while playing\nwith his siblings, he was shot in one eye with an \u201cairsoft\u201d gun (similar to a BB gun,\nbut firing plastic or rubber pellets), causing temporary blindness in that eye. Dr.\nStinson testified that Lawson has continued to have \u201cvision problems\u201d since that\ninjury. In addition, Lawson\u2019s gallbladder was removed in 2010.\n       {\u00b6 171} In 2011, Lawson suffered multiple medical problems. Severe\nheadaches required several doctor and hospital visits.        He also experienced\ndegenerative disc disease, abdominal pain, and \u201cabnormal findings related to his\ncolon and appendix.\u201d In 2017, Lawson was in a \u201cfender-bender\u201d accident and\nstruck his head on a rear-view mirror. While he did not seek medical attention at\nthe time, he experienced chronic headaches after the accident.\n       {\u00b6 172} In addition to the above factors, Lawson expressed remorse for the\nmurders in his confession and in his unsworn statement. He told the panel, \u201cI know\nwhat I did was wrong\u201d and stated that he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for what he did. He\napologized to everyone he had harmed, including the four murder victims and his\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nown family. He said that he cannot sleep at night, cries all the time, cries himself\nto sleep, and has flashbacks. He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t expect sympathy. * * * If it\nbe death penalty, then I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m at peace with whatever you give me.\u201d\nLawson also expressed his remorse to Dr. Stinson, who felt that Lawson\u2019s remorse\nwas sincere.\n       {\u00b6 173} Dr. Stinson testified about Lawson\u2019s conduct in the Morrow\nCounty jail, where he was held pending trial. A jail supervisor described Lawson\nto Dr. Stinson as trustworthy, well behaved, respectful, and \u201cnot * * * a problem.\u201d\nOther correctional officers consistently told Dr. Stinson that Lawson was not\ncausing any problems.      Whenever Dr. Stinson saw Lawson interacting with\nofficers, they seemed to have a tension-free and professional relationship. On one\noccasion, Lawson gave jail staff members advance warning that several other\ninmates were planning to disrupt jail operations by flooding their toilets.\n       {\u00b6 174} Lawson\u2019s jail records showed two \u201cwrite-ups\u201d in the approximately\n16 months he was there. In January 2018, he got upset about a lockdown, kicked a\ndoor, and threatened an officer; he lost all privileges as a result. Dr. Stinson\ndescribed the other incident as \u201cequivocal.\u201d A Lawrence County deputy sheriff\nwho was transporting Lawson accused him of resisting him and of disrespect and\ndisobedience; however, a Morrow County deputy stated that there had been no\nproblem. Lawson was not disciplined for this incident. Overall, Dr. Stinson opined\nthat when compared to other inmates he had worked with, Lawson had adjusted to\nincarceration \u201crelatively\u201d well, even \u201cremarkably well.\u201d\n                   5. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n       {\u00b6 175} The trial court gleaned one mitigating factor from the\ncircumstances of the offense: while in the Holstons\u2019 house on the day of the\nmurders, Lawson fed two-year-old B.H., changed his diaper, and put him down for\na nap. Beyond that, nothing about the nature and circumstances of the offenses in\nthis case could be considered mitigating.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                     C. Weighing\n          {\u00b6 176} We must determine whether the aggravating circumstances that\nwere found by the three-judge panel outweigh the mitigating factors presented in\nthis case beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.05(A) and 2929.03(D)(1); see State\nv. Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, \u00b6 140. We\ndetermine that they do.\n          {\u00b6 177} Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is the strongest mitigating factor in\nthis case.     At various times, Lawson was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,\ndepression, and PTSD, and he did not receive adequate treatment for these\ndisorders. See State v. Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3d\n841, \u00b6 209. We note in particular that bipolar disorder is \u201ca major mental illness.\u201d\nKetterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 205. Although\nDr. Stinson did not testify that the murders were attributable to Lawson\u2019s mental\ndisorders, we find that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history is entitled to substantial\nweight.\n          {\u00b6 178} We must consider Lawson\u2019s youth as a mitigating factor. See R.C.\n2929.04(B)(4). This court has frequently upheld death sentences for 23-year-old\nmurderers and has ordinarily given the (B)(4) factor little weight in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at \u00b6 195\n(\u201clittle weight\u201d); State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d\n1173, \u00b6 173 (\u201cmodest weight\u201d); State v. Ferguson, 108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-\n1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b6 127 (\u201clittle weight\u201d). We recognize that we recently\naccorded \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the age of an offender in Graham, id. at \u00b6 207.\nHowever, Graham is fundamentally distinguishable. Graham had just turned 19 at\nthe time he committed aggravated murder, a little more than one year removed from\nthe minimum age for death-penalty eligibility. In contrast, Lawson was 23 when\nhe committed the murders at issue here, a more significant passage of time from\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe minimum age of eligibility. Therefore, we consider Lawson\u2019s youth to be a\nfactor that carries some weight.\n       {\u00b6 179} The evidence that Lawson was abused is not conclusive. The\nrecord does show, however, that Lawson experienced a degree of instability in his\nupbringing, with several changes in custody and living arrangements. The evidence\nalso shows that he was surrounded by poor role models and had few good role\nmodels and that he felt unloved and worthless.\n       {\u00b6 180} Because Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the four\naggravated murders in this case, he had at least some \u201ctime to distance himself from\nhis childhood and allow other factors to assert themselves in his personality and his\nbehavior,\u201d State v. Campbell, 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 53, 765 N.E.2d 334 (2002);\ncompare Johnson, 144 Ohio St.3d 518, 2015-Ohio-4903, 45 N.E.3d 208, at \u00b6 138\n(19-year-old offender was \u201cnot far removed\u201d from his upbringing).\n       {\u00b6 181} Yet we have \u201cseldom ascribed much weight in mitigation to a\ndefendant\u2019s unstable or troubled childhood.\u201d State v. Kirkland, 160 Ohio St.3d 389,\n2020-Ohio-4079, 157 N.E.3d 716, \u00b6 174, citing Campbell at 51-54; see also State\nv. Cooey, 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 41, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989). And Lawson\u2019s childhood\nsurely presents nothing comparable to State v. Tenace, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-\nOhio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, which we have noted as \u201c[t]he benchmark case for\nassessing the weight of childhood trauma\u201d based on its \u201cappalling facts,\u201d State v.\nBeasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-493, 108 N.E.3d 1028, \u00b6 248. The\ndefendant in Tenace was raised by criminal and drug-addicted parents, sold by his\nmother for sexual services, forced to watch his sister being sexually abused, and\nencouraged to cheat and steal. Tenace at \u00b6 102-103. Therefore, Lawson\u2019s history\nand background are entitled to some weight, \u201cbut only to the extent his \u2018criminal\n* * * acts are attributable to\u2019 it,\u201d Campbell at 53, quoting California v. Brown, 479\nU.S. 538, 545, 2017 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 182} Although retrospective remorse is ordinarily not a strong mitigating\nfactor, \u201cremorse [that] leads to surrender and confession is a more impressive\nfactor.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 93, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991). In this case,\nLawson did surrender\u2014although that decision may have been influenced by a cold\nnight in the woods without supplies, shelter, or weapons. More importantly,\nLawson gave a complete, truthful confession that aided the police with their crime-\nscene investigation. Therefore, we find that Lawson\u2019s remorse and cooperation are\nentitled to some weight in mitigation. His generally good conduct in jail is also\nentitled to some weight.\n       {\u00b6 183} With respect to D.H.\u2019s murder, the aggravating circumstances\ninclude that Lawson engaged in a course of conduct\u2014i.e., committed multiple\nmurders\u2014and the fact that D.H. was younger than 13. \u201cIn particular, the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it\ninvolves the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 328. And the cold-blooded nature\nand details of D.H.\u2019s murder are especially significant concerns. Moreover, the\ncommission of multiple murders is a grave aggravating circumstance that carries\ngreat weight. State v. Hutton, 100 Ohio St.3d 176, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.E.2d\n948, \u00b6 91.   The two felony-murder circumstances and the escaping-detection\ncircumstance add still more weight to the state\u2019s side of the scales.\n       {\u00b6 184} The murders of Stacey and her parents lack the child-murder\naggravating circumstance, but each has a course-of-conduct and a felony-murder\ncircumstance. In addition, the murders of Stacey\u2019s parents have the escaping-\ndetection circumstance.\n       {\u00b6 185} Two recent cases in which we have found that aggravation did not\noutweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, Johnson and Graham, each\ninvolved 19-year-old defendants, both of whom \u201centered a residence to commit\nrobbery and killed a [single] person inside.\u201d Graham, 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio-6700, 172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 215. By contrast, Lawson was 23 years old; he\nentered the Holstons\u2019 residence and lay in wait specifically to kill; over a period of\n12 hours, he killed four people, one an eight-year-old child who should not even\nhave been in the house, and he attempted to kill a fifth.\n        {\u00b6 186} This case invites particular comparison with Graham, which it\nresembles in that both Lawson and Graham were young defendants who suffered\nfrom untreated or insufficiently treated mental-health issues and adverse\nenvironmental factors. See Graham at \u00b6 196. In fact, Lawson\u2019s mental disorders\u2014\nbipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety\u2014are more significant than\nGraham\u2019s oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, see id.\n        {\u00b6 187} However, this case is distinguishable from Graham in numerous\nimportant ways. We have already noted some of the key distinctions: Lawson was\nfour years older than Graham was when the crimes were committed; Lawson killed\nfour people to Graham\u2019s one; one of Lawson\u2019s victims was eight years old and that\ninnocent victim was in the house only because of Lawson\u2019s deception; Lawson\nentered the house where the crimes occurred with the express purpose of\ncommitting murder, unlike Graham, who entered for the purpose of robbery with\nno intention to kill anyone. And the list goes on.\n        {\u00b6 188} While Graham was the principal offender in the aggravated murder\nhe committed, he \u201cwas not the mastermind,\u201d 164 Ohio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700,\n172 N.E.3d 841, at \u00b6 205, of the drug robbery that led to the murder; he was\nrecruited by a friend. In this case, Lawson was not just the principal offender; he\nwas the sole offender. Nobody recruited or enticed him; the whole thing was his\nidea.\n        {\u00b6 189} The murder in Graham was a quick reaction to events during the\nrobbery: Graham told the victim not to look at the robbers, the victim expressed\ndoubt that Graham would shoot him, and Graham shot him. Id. at \u00b6 12. In contrast,\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nLawson planned and prepared for Stacey\u2019s murder well in advance and committed\nfour murders over a 12-hour period in which the death toll mounted.\n         {\u00b6 190} Like Lawson, Graham used marijuana daily. But unlike Lawson,\nGraham was also addicted to Xanax, using \u201cmassive\u201d daily amounts of it, Graham\nat \u00b6 199. Moreover, Graham\u2019s Xanax use made him more irritable and aggressive\nand less inhibited. Id. at \u00b6 199, 210. Indeed, Graham\u2019s expert witness testified that\nit was unlikely that Graham would have committed the murder but for his Xanax\naddiction. Id. at \u00b6 199. Lawson had a cannabis-use disorder, but according to Dr.\nStinson it caused no major impairment of his functioning, and there is no evidence\nthat drug use played any role in the murders in this case.\n         {\u00b6 191} This case is undeniably one in which the defendant has presented\nsignificant mitigating factors. But this is also a case in which the defendant\nslaughtered four people, including the callous slaying of an eight-year-old child.\nWith respect to each of the four aggravated murders before us, we find that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n                                D. Proportionality\n         {\u00b6 192} We further determine that the death sentences for these crimes are\nproportionate to sentences approved in similar cases. We have approved death\nsentences in cases combining multiple murders with one or more child murders.\nState v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051; State v.\nPowell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865; Trimble, 122 Ohio\nSt.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242; Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347,\n2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180. Indeed, we have approved death sentences in\nnumerous cases that involved multiple murders when all the victims were adults.\nSee, e.g., State v. Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, 89 N.E.3d 554\n(two murders, one attempted murder); Beasley, 153 Ohio St.3d 497, 2018-Ohio-\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n493, 108 N.E.3d 1028 (three murders, one attempted murder); State v. Madison,\n160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867 (three murders).\n                              VIII. CONCLUSION\n       {\u00b6 193} We affirm the judgments of conviction. We further affirm all four\nsentences of death.\n                                                                Judgment affirmed.\n       FISCHER and DEWINE, JJ., concur.\n       DONNELLY, J., concurs, with an opinion.\n       O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in judgment only and concurs in Justice\nDonnelly\u2019s concurring opinion.\n       STEWART, J., concurs in part and dissents in part and would reverse the\ndeath sentences.\n       BRUNNER, J., dissents, with an opinion.\n                               _________________\n       DONNELLY, J., concurring.\n       {\u00b6 194} Respectfully, I fully concur with this court\u2019s judgment affirming\nappellant Arron L. Lawson\u2019s convictions. I reluctantly concur, however, with this\ncourt\u2019s judgment affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentence.\n       {\u00b6 195} Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder, and depression, there is no denying that Lawson suffers from serious\nmental illnesses and that he did not receive adequate treatment for these disorders.\nOf these diagnoses, bipolar disorder has been found to be a major mental illness.\nSee State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 172,\n205. The majority opinion recognizes that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history was\nsubstantial and accorded it the mitigating factor entitled to the strongest weight.\nSee majority opinion at \u00b6 177. The General Assembly has also recognized the\ncritical importance of this issue, see 2020 Am.Sub.H.B.

Atkins at 321. The\nUnited States Supreme Court has also prohibited the execution of juveniles,\nrecognizing their developmental immaturity and diminished culpability. Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-571, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). In Ohio,\nthe General Assembly has recently prohibited the imposition of the death penalty\nfor the crime of aggravated murder when the defendant had a serious mental illness\nat the time that he committed the offense. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.02(A), 2929.025,\nand other statutes enacted in 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136. This case is therefore\nabout more than whether appellant, Arron Lawson, was able to consult with his\nlawyers and reasonably understand the proceedings against him. This appeal is an\nopportunity for this court to reexamine the protections and precautions that are\ncentral to ensuring that any death sentence that is imposed is appropriate and\nsubjected to a reliable, deliberate, and rigorous constitutional review.\n       {\u00b6 199} Former Justice Paul Pfeifer stated when he served as a justice of\nthis court that \u201c[t]he death penalty should be reserved for the most severe of cases.\u201d\nState v. Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d 56, 75, 706 N.E.2d 1231 (1999) (Pfeifer, J.,\ndissenting); see also State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 563, 747 N.E.2d 765\n(2001) (Pfeifer, J., dissenting) (the death penalty should be imposed only on \u201cthose\nmurderers who truly deserve death\u201d).           It is difficult to imagine Lawson\u2019s\nhorrendous acts not falling into the category of the worst of cases. But this court is\nconstitutionally bound to not only review Lawson\u2019s sentence but also to verify the\nintegrity of the process leading to the imposition of the death penalty as the\npunishment for his crimes. This should not be a mechanistic analysis; it should be\na thorough endeavor that closely examines all aspects of the proceedings that have\nculminated in our review. Because there are too many unaddressed concerns in the\nmajority\u2019s analysis, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n   I. Lawson\u2019s Competency to Enter Guilty Pleas and Waive a Jury Trial\n            A. A trial court\u2019s duty regarding a defendant\u2019s competency\n       {\u00b6 200} When the issue of competency is \u201craised\u201d before trial by counsel\nfor a criminal defendant, by the prosecution, or by the court, a hearing on the matter\nis mandatory. R.C. 2945.37(B); State v. Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d 108, 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016 (1986). Likewise, after the conclusion of the trial-court proceedings, if a\nperson who was convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death wanted to forgo\nfurther legal challenges, essentially volunteering for death, this court has required\nthat the person undergo a competency evaluation and that the trial court hold a\nhearing before such a request would be honored. See State v. Berry, 74 Ohio St.3d\n1492, 658 N.E.2d 1062 (1996) (ordering that an independent psychiatric expert be\nappointed); State v. Berry, 77 Ohio St.3d 1439, 671 N.E.2d 1279 (1996) (remanding\nthe matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on mental competency). For\nthe period of litigation lying between the two markers of a death-penalty\nproceeding\u2014i.e., before the trial and during or following the sentencing (such as\nforgoing an appeal or forgoing other legal challenges)\u2014there are points at which a\ndefendant\u2019s decision or request may or is likely to be an indicator that his\ncompetency to assist in his own defense should be determined pursuant to R.C.\n2945.37(G), such as when a defendant indicates his or her wish to terminate\ncounsel\u2019s representation, when a defendant indicates his or her wish to waive a jury\ntrial, and when a defendant indicates his or her wish to forgo the presentation of all\nor some mitigating evidence at sentencing.         These pivotal points along the\ncontinuum of a death-penalty prosecution are critical events that could serve in\nwhole or in part to tip the scales of justice toward or away from the ultimate\npunishment\u2014death.\n       {\u00b6 201} Therefore, it is understood that R.C. 2945.37(B) dictates that when\nrequested before trial, a competency examination is mandatory and that when a\ndefendant wishes to waive the ability to challenge an imposed death sentence, a\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncompetency hearing is required, see State v. Berry, 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 375, 686\nN.E.2d 1097 (1997).      However, clear guidelines are lacking about the way\ncompetency should be questioned and examined in the stages that occur between\nthe period before the start of a trial and the final imposition of a death sentence.\nThus, trial courts have been free to apply whatever standards they choose during\nthose stages, and their decisions are not overturned on appeal unless there are\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d in the record, State v. Were, 94 Ohio St.3d\n173, 761 N.E.2d 591 (2002), paragraph two of the syllabus. This court has stated\nthat \u201c \u2018[c]ommon sense dictates that no defendant can make a record of lack of\ncompetency absent the findings and hearings contemplated by R.C. 2945.37 and\n2945.371.\u2019 \u201d Were at 177, quoting Bock at 113 (Wright, J., dissenting). Thus,\nrelying on a record when there is no requirement to create one is hardly the model\nof fair process, and it cannot in any sense be deemed rigorously constitutional.\n                   B. Indicia of incompetency in Lawson\u2019s case\n       {\u00b6 202} Lawson has raised three areas of concern that, taken together,\nshould be held to have triggered the trial court\u2019s duty to order a pretrial\nincompetency exam: when Lawson acted against the advice of his counsel by\nwaiving a trial and entering guilty pleas, when Lawson exhibited indecisiveness\nabout his decision to enter guilty pleas, and when Lawson revealed to the court that\nhe was taking prescription medications. Going against the advice of counsel, alone,\ndoes not equate with incompetence. Indecisiveness, alone, may not necessarily\nconstitute a clear indicator that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Nor may\ntaking prescription medications, standing alone, be a clear indicator of\nincompetence. Our inquiry in this appeal, however, is not whether we believe that\nLawson was competent; it is whether these factors taken together should be held to\nreasonably indicate to a trial court that further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s\ncompetency is required, to ensure the fairness of the proceeding, especially in a\ncapital case. See R.C. 2945.37(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                      January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 203} There were indicia, i.e., signs or indications, that should have\nprompted\u2014and did prompt\u2014the trial court to further inquire about concerns of\npossible \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d regarding Lawson\u2019s competency to\nwaive a trial and change his pleas. On multiple occasions, the trial court raised the\nissue of a possible competency evaluation.1 The record is clear that the presiding\ntrial judge was hesitating and \u201csecond-guessing\u201d whether the types of\nconsiderations underlying Atkins, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335,\nand other precedents had been observed or applied. The trial judge appeared\nhesitant about Lawson\u2019s thought process in making the grave and weighty decision\nto plead guilty in a proceeding that could carry the consequential punishment of\ndeath.\n         {\u00b6 204} Lawson\u2019s actions in waiving his right to a jury trial and entering\npleas of guilty to multiple capital offenses, combined with the trial court\u2019s\nhesitations, were indicia of incompetency that do exist in our limited record,\nconsidering that no competency examination or hearing ever occurred. It should\nnot be our role to guess from the evidence what Lawson\u2019s state of mind was and\ntherefore what his mental capabilities were.                If he had been assessed for\ncompetency, we would be able to read a report from a mental-health professional\nabout his ability and state of mind. Without that kind of evidence, it is difficult to\ndiscern from the record whether Lawson was exercising the rights of a rational,\nmentally and physically healthy person in making this decision. See Berry, 80 Ohio\nSt.3d at 375, 686 N.E.2d 1097, quoting Smith v. Armentrout, 812 F.2d 1050, 1057\n(8th Cir.1987) (it is \u201c \u2018very probable\u2019 \u201d that in \u201c \u2018every case\u2019 \u201d in which a capital\n\n\n1. The majority opinion outlines the discussions between the trial judge and counsel regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency, including an in-chambers discussion on February 11, 2019. During that\ndiscussion, the trial judge noted that he had \u201cbrought this [issue] up months ago\u201d and was now\n\u201csecond-guessing\u201d his decision to decline to order a competency evaluation. Further discussion in\nthe record occurred on February 21, 2019, when the presiding trial judge asked counsel whether\nthey had any concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d and\ninquired as to counsel\u2019s investigation of those issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                               59\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant desires to \u201c \u2018abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility\nthat the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect\u2019 \u201d). That we\nwould guess or infer what a competency evaluation would have shown debases our\nunique role in reviewing death-penalty appeals.\n       {\u00b6 205} The record is clear that when the trial court during the plea colloquy\nasked Lawson whether his mental clarity was affected by any medications, Lawson\ndisclosed that he was taking several\u2014naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and\nZoloft. The trial court questioned Lawson and defense counsel regarding these\nmedications and asked whether they could be affecting Lawson\u2019s ability to reason\nor his judgment. And while there is no affirmative indication in the record that\nLawson\u2019s medications did affect his ability to understand or reason, more inquiry\ncertainly was in order. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 174-175, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d\n103 (discussing whether, in light of inferences drawn from the undisputed evidence,\nthe trial court\u2019s failure to further inquire into a defendant\u2019s competency deprived\nhim of a fair trial). Unanswered questions remained: Why was he taking those\nmedications? How long had he been taking those medications? What medical\ndiagnoses and symptoms indicated that those medications should be prescribed?\nWas he experiencing or had he ever experienced any side effects from those\nmedications, including drowsiness, confusion, or suicidal thoughts? A competency\nexam could have provided answers to these questions to allay concerns regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency.       Lawson\u2019s statement that he was taking prescription\nmedications was, at a minimum, a legitimate factor relating to the fundamental\nquestion of his competency to stand trial and to decide to plead guilty to capital\nmurder.\n       {\u00b6 206} The majority, citing State v. Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717\nN.E.2d 298 (1999), reasons that the trial court and defense counsel were able to\nobserve Lawson and that he exhibited no behavior that raised any question as to his\ncompetency. There are a number of reasons why licensed members of the legal\n\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nprofession and the judiciary should not perform competency evaluations based on\ntheir own observations, either directly or indirectly by reading a record. Using this\nmethod to make what amounts to a medical determination that a person charged\nwith a capital crime is or was competent is not only constitutionally flawed, it is\nunacceptable. This is particularly so when there is evidence that a defendant is\ntaking prescription medications that may affect his or her behavior or demeanor.2\nNo one asked Lawson whether drowsiness or confusion might be a side effect of\nany of his medications.           No one asked Lawson whether any of his current\nmedications were prescribed for impulse control. No one asked Lawson whether\nhe was depressed or suicidal. And no one asked him on the record why he was\nchoosing to plead guilty to capital offenses.\n         {\u00b6 207} Lawson\u2019s decision to waive a trial and enter pleas of guilty in this\ncapital case, combined with the trial court\u2019s apparent misgivings as they appear in\nthe record, support that further inquiry into Lawson\u2019s competency was necessary.\nI would thus reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment based on this issue and would\nremand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings regarding Lawson\u2019s\ncompetency.\n  C. R.C. 2945.37(B) requires a hearing when the issue of competency is raised\n         {\u00b6 208} The majority rejects Lawson\u2019s argument that R.C. 2945.37(B)\nrequired a competency hearing in this case, concluding that the issue was not\nsufficiently raised at trial and that, even if it had been, not raising it was harmless\nerror. When \u201cthe issue of the defendant\u2019s competence\u201d to stand trial is \u201craised\u201d\nbefore the trial has begun, \u201cthe court shall hold a hearing on the issue.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) R.C. 2945.37(B). The statute does not require the issue to be sufficiently\n\n\n2. According to information available on the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website, drowsiness is a side effect\nof most of the medications Lawson was taking; confusion is a side effect of Vistaril and\nmetronidazole; and suicidal thoughts, loss of memory, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality\nare side effects of Zoloft. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs (accessed July 9, 2021)\n[https://perma.cc/UL5E-XLDS].\n\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nraised, raised by motion, or raised with the intention of obtaining or ordering a\nhearing. See id. (\u201cthe court, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue\u201d).\n        {\u00b6 209} On multiple occasions before the trial began, the trial court itself\nraised the issue whether a competency evaluation should be done. See fn. 1 of this\nopinion, supra. The majority interprets the record to indicate that the trial-court\njudge was merely asking the defense whether it wanted a competency hearing. But\nisn\u2019t it just as plausible that the trial judge was truly questioning whether there was\nenough information available to reach a sound conclusion that Lawson was\ncompetent to not only stand trial but to waive it? At any rate, this was not a situation\nin which the trial judge specifically stated that Lawson \u201c \u2018evidenced no mental\ninstability,\u2019 \u201d Cowans, 87 Ohio St.3d at 84, 717 N.E.2d 298. Rather, the court\n\u201craised\u201d the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency for purposes of R.C. 2945.37(B).\n        {\u00b6 210} Nothing prohibits this court from reviewing the record and\ndetermining that the issue of competency was raised. Nothing prohibits us from\nremanding this case for a competency evaluation to be conducted and a competency\nhearing to be held; the result of that hearing would determine the course of events\nfrom that point. Such a hearing is required by statute, but one was not held. If we\ndo this, we would accomplish several important aims. We would acknowledge the\ngravity of any capital defendant\u2019s adverse-interest request to plead guilty to a\ncapital offense. We would also provide valuable guidance to this state\u2019s trial courts\nthat creating a sound record compliant with R.C. 2945.37(B) is required, especially\nwhen the defendant is making an adverse-interest decision, such as waiving a trial\nand pleading guilty to one or more capital offenses. Remanding this case for a\ncompetency hearing would be of benefit to the public in ensuring a high standard\nof compliance with due-process principles in cases in which a death sentence could\nbe imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 211} The issue of Lawson\u2019s competency was raised, requiring the trial\ncourt to hold a competency hearing. See Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 109, 502 N.E.2d\n1016; R.C. 2945.37(B). We should require that this hearing be held.\n                 D. General problems with the current framework\n       {\u00b6 212} When a capital defendant seeks to abandon his or her rights and\nacquiesce in entering a guilty plea, essentially clearing the thorny thicket on the\npath toward execution by the state, we owe that defendant, the victims and their\nfamilies, the lower courts, and the public at large a standardized approach to ensure\nfairness and uniformity in trials of this gravamen. Viewing the record using the\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d method falls short, because it is based on\ngleaning information from a record when often no record was made.\n       {\u00b6 213} It is not acceptable to simply rely on the observations of the trial\ncourt and/or the experiences and opinions of defense counsel that a criminal\ndefendant is competent to stand trial.        The dissenting opinion in State v.\nMontgomery, relying on State v. Mink, 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805\nN.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 66, and United States v. Damon, 191 F.3d 561, 565 (4th Cir.1999),\nsquarely addressed this point:\n\n\n       The majority seems to be satisfied that [appellant, Caron\n       Montgomery,] stated in open court that he understood what he was\n       doing and that he signed a written waiver. This conclusion was\n       bolstered by the opinion of Montgomery\u2019s attorney\u2014who was not a\n       medical expert\u2014that Montgomery understood the rights that he was\n       waiving. But if medication prevented Montgomery from truly\n       comprehending his actions, how reliable were his spoken assurances\n       and his signed statement to the contrary? The trial court did not\n       inquire about whether or how the medications affected\n       Montgomery\u2019s abilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n               I believe that more was required under Mink and Damon. At\n       the very least, when someone is undoubtedly under the influence of\n       a prescription medication when making the decision to enter a guilty\n       plea, the trial court must inquire about the effects of the medication\n       so that it can ensure that the defendant understands the gravity of the\n       situation and comprehends his or her actions. This court should not\n       affirm a conviction, let alone a death sentence, by guessing about\n       the mental competence of a defendant. Further inquiry was required\n       before the trial court accepted Montgomery\u2019s plea of guilty.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71\nN.E.3d 180, \u00b6 196-197 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting). Most attorneys and judges are not\npracticing mental-health or disability experts. Relying on a defense attorney\u2019s\nopinion, when that opinion is likely to be a one-off (based on how defense counsel\ninterprets the defendant\u2019s behavior at that particular juncture of the trial),\nanecdotally based opinion on the defendant\u2019s competency is neither a sound legal\nnor ethical practice.   Judging a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity to reason and\nunderstand through observed behavior by defense counsel and/or the court,\nespecially when coupled with a grave, adverse-interest decision such as pleading\nguilty to one or more capital offenses, denies due process when the defendant is\ntaking prescription medication with clinical indications and side effects that\nresearch shows may affect sound reasoning at the time the defendant changes his\nor her plea. And, finally, there is an inherent and systemic flaw that may not even\nbe recognized when we perpetuate reliance on judges\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 subjective\nassessments of a capital defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or change a plea:\nperhaps we perpetuate predisposed ideas and stereotyped, culture- or race-based\nperceptions and predispositions about what is acceptable behavior during a trial.\nSee State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 62-\n\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\f                                        January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n63 (giving deference to those who saw and heard the proceedings and stating that\nthe defendant \u201cdisplayed no outrageous, irrational behavior during trial\u201d).

In examining cases in which this court has considered the issue whether a competency\nexamination or hearing should have been conducted when a defendant made a request adverse to\nhis own interest, this court has overwhelmingly held that insufficient indicia of incompetency were\npresent.

Id. at 175-176.\nWe determined that this perfect storm of facts met the \u201csufficient indicia\u201d test: a\ndefense attorney who was adept at recognizing potential incompetency, a defendant\nwhose behavior rose to such a level that his counsel believed that he was not able\nto understand the proceedings against him, and the existence in the record of\nnumerous motions and requests for a competency assessment. Id. This court\u2019s\ndecision today permits and perpetuates a practice that a clinical evaluation of the\nmental competence of a defendant in a death-penalty case is not needed when a\ndefendant pleads guilty to the crime, even though there is ample evidence in the\nrecord of his mental illness. And we find today that no medical evaluation for\ncompetency is required when a defendant\u2019s experienced attorney\u2014by self-\nproclamation\u2014has adjudged his client to be competent based on counsel\u2019s stated\nability to recognize mental illness, even when that client may not outwardly\ndemonstrate visible symptoms of mental illness to nonclinical laypersons during\nthe limited time they interact with them.\n       {\u00b6 215} In short, the approach perpetuated in this case denies criminal\ndefendants accused of capital crimes the guarantee that the laws of this state will\nbe applied in a rigorously constitutional manner when the consequences may be\nirrevocable. We should not continue to rely on indicia in the record as sufficient to\ndetermine a defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty without requiring evidence\nbased on sound medical judgment. It is incumbent on this court to require in death-\npenalty cases what is now readily at our disposal\u2014the use of science in a\ncompetency evaluation so that the state puts to death only those whom we may\nfairly determine have knowingly and competently pleaded guilty. In doing this, we\nwould avoid what amounts to guessing who is competent based on \u201cindicia\u201d (that\nmay or may not make it into the record) in favor of science-based evidence that is\ninformed by evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n     E. The need for evidence-based practices and not just indicia in the record\n        {\u00b6 216} On February 21, 2019, when the trial court held a change-of-plea\nhearing for Lawson, the presiding judge asked defense counsel whether they had\nany concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency.\u201d\nLead defense counsel first informed the court that he was not \u201ca psychologist or a\npsychiatrist\u201d and was not in a position to \u201ctechnically answer\u201d that question.\nDefense counsel then informed the trial court that Dr. Bob Stinson had been\nconsulted on the issue and that the defense did not intend to raise the issue of\nLawson\u2019s competency. At this point in the proceedings, there was nothing in the\nrecord about Lawson\u2019s being suicidal, having attempted suicide in the past, having\nexperienced (or at the time experiencing) confusion and possible hallucinations, or\ntaking several medications. The fact that those indicia were not yet in the record at\nthis point does not negate their existence. It does, however, demonstrate the\ninherent flaws in this court\u2019s current \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d test.\n        {\u00b6 217} Defense counsel, the prosecutors, and the trial court entertained the\npossibility of having Dr. Stinson render an opinion on Lawson\u2019s competency. Dr.\nStinson had been hired as a mental- and behavioral-health expert for the mitigation\nphase of the trial. He was not hired to perform a competency examination for the\npurpose of trial. However, had the trial court been able to conduct at least a review\nof his written report at this juncture of the proceedings, the following would have\nbecome apparent:\n1.      Lawson was raised in a dysfunctional family, suffered from poverty,\n        emotional abuse, and probably physical abuse, and was exposed to familial\n        incest;\n2.      Lawson\u2019s family members had a history of mental illness, including bipolar\n        disorder, depression, and suicidal behavior, and had a history of alcoholism\n        and drug abuse; Lawson\u2019s mother was rated as being \u201csignificantly\n        functionally impaired\u201d by her physician;\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n3.     Lawson had mental-health problems starting at least by age 13, when he\n       was enrolled in anger-management classes; he was diagnosed with bipolar\n       disorder in 2011; he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on two\n       occasions following suicidal and homicidal episodes; he has been diagnosed\n       with depressive disorder and posttraumatic-stress disorder;\n4.     Since his psychiatric hospitalizations, he has been on a number of\n       medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressant medicines,\n       antipsychotic drugs, and a medication to help with sleep and to control\n       impulses;\n5.     After his arrest, Lawson was seen by staff members at Shawnee Mental\n       Health, where he disclosed that he had attempted to hang himself several\n       years before and reported that he had been having thoughts of suicide;\n6.     After his arrest, Lawson was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and\n       reported to Dr. Stinson that he was having trouble sleeping and\n       concentrating and was occasionally having auditory and visual\n       hallucinations.\n       {\u00b6 218} This information about Lawson was not discussed at all at this point\nin the proceedings even though it is discussed in this court\u2019s majority opinion. The\nArron Lawson identified and described in Dr. Stinson\u2019s report is a person impaired\nby mental illness who has a stated history of being suicidal. The trial court was not\npresented with this information until the mitigation phase of the proceeding, and\nthis is precisely an example of the problem with the test this court adopted in the\npast and once again applies in Lawson\u2019s case. Had the trial court simply ordered a\ncompetency examination, as was discussed at several junctures during the trial\nphase, the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency to stand trial would have been made clear\nin the record beyond the mere presence of vague indicia that the record now\ncontains.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 219} Putting someone to death for his or her crimes, even when the\ncrimes are heinous and when it is apparent that the person on trial is the person who\ncommitted the crimes, is always subject to the constitutional due-process principles\ncontained in the Bill of Rights, a document once demanded by, and its contents now\nguaranteed to, the people. Due-process principles are not satisfied by guessing or\nby the acknowledged inexactitude of gleaning indicia from a sketchy trial record.\nThe determination of Lawson\u2019s competency should be based on evidence. That the\nquestion of his competency was \u201craised\u201d was enough to require the trial court to\norder a competency evaluation and a hearing on the matter under R.C. 2945.37(B),\nno matter what his attorney said to the court. See Drope, 420 U.S. at 177, 95 S.Ct.\n896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (finding that even when a question of competency is inartfully\nraised \u201cit would have been, at the very least, the better practice to order an\nimmediate examination\u201d).\n          {\u00b6 220} No longer should this court rely on the mere scaffolding of\ntradition, intuition, and prior case authority for determining a matter that is the\nsubject of scientifically supportable evidence, especially when a statute (R.C.\n2945.37(B)) requires otherwise.       The benefits of requiring evidenced-based\npractices when determining a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial are similar to\nthe benefits that are detailed in clinical literature for programs involving everything\nfrom medicine and nursing, to education, to mental-health and substance-abuse\nservices, to psychiatry, to the imposing of criminal-justice sanctions and more. See,\ne.g., Social Programs that Work, http://www.evidencebasedprograms.org\n(accessed July 9, 2021) [https://perma.cc/T76K-9KFZ].

This governmental center \u201cprovides communities,\nclinicians, policy-makers and others with the information and tools to incorporate\nevidence-based practices into their communities or clinical settings.\u201d Id. The\ncenter\u2019s website contains a plethora of publications on both substance abuse and\nmental illness, including co-occurring disorders, for both youths and adults. This\ncourt should be requiring that evidence-based practices be the standard for\ncompetency evidence used by the courts of this state for what are essentially clinical\nconclusions regarding defendants\u2019 competency to stand trial. Once we do this, we\nwill have taken a giant stride to ensure that due-process principles are adhered to in\nthe prosecutions of persons accused of crimes, especially those accused of\ncommitting capital crimes.\n     F. Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest request\n       {\u00b6 221} When reading the fact pattern of violence and often torture that\noccurs in nearly every death-penalty case, the reader is left to conjecture: Who in\ntheir right mind could do such a thing? Since that perception is present from the\nbeginning, and since an adverse-interest request such as agreeing to plead guilty to\na capital offense as charged could be viewed as irrational and against the\ndefendant\u2019s self-interests, it would be best for courts to start from a presumption\nthat competency is at issue whenever a defendant makes an adverse-interest\nrequest. Starting with this presumption and questioning competency in this way\nwould mean that a trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2945.37(B) would be ensured.\nThe trial court would then be required to conduct further inquiry, thus creating a\nrecord and instilling a more reliable, constitutional approach.\n       {\u00b6 222} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest alleviates the necessity for a court to inquire as to defense counsel\u2019s position\non the subject. The judiciary must dismiss the temptation to put defense attorneys\nin the position of assessing their clients\u2019 capabilities, which goes beyond the\nattorneys\u2019 expertise and their ethical duties. We also should steer courts away from\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nlooking for subjectively bizarre behavior and encourage them to simply obtain\ninformation from a clinical expert using evidence-based practices.\n       {\u00b6 223} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest also triggers the building of a record. A competency examination and a\nhearing would be the most comprehensive way to ensure a complete and thorough\nrecord. The trial court should make a finding one way or the other based on\nevidence in the record regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand\nchoices and assist in his or her own defense. This includes determining whether\nthe defendant possesses the ability to comprehend the ramifications of his or her\ndecision, including understanding that the choice may lead to death, determining\nwhether the defendant is able to make such a decision knowingly and intelligently,\nnot unduly affected by conditions of mental health, physical health, or\nimprisonment, and determining whether the defendant possesses the ability to\nreason logically and fully understands the ramifications of his decision. Berry, 80\nOhio St.3d at 371, 374-376, 686 N.E.2d 1097.\n       {\u00b6 224} For example, in State v. Mink, in which the defendant was charged\nwith aggravated murder for the horrendous stabbings and beatings of his parents,\nthe trial court sua sponte appointed two psychologists to conduct separate\ncompetency examinations when Mink first informed the court that he wished to\nenter pleas of guilty to all counts, to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand to represent himself. 101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064,\nat \u00b6 31, 59-60. The trial court then made an initial determination based on the\nreports of those psychologists that Mink was competent to stand trial and accepted\nhis guilty pleas and later made a separate determination that Mink was competent\nto waive the presentation of mitigating evidence, after which it sentenced him to\ndeath. Id. at \u00b6 22-26, 60. This court affirmed Mink\u2019s death sentence and he was\neventually executed as he had requested, see id. at \u00b6 26, but because the trial court\nhad insisted on and had conducted a thorough, evidence-based process, we were\n\n\n\n\n                                         71\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nnot left to doubt the constitutionality of Mink\u2019s death sentence with regard to his\ncompetency. We noted that the trial court had gone \u201cto great lengths\u201d before\nfinding him competent, id. at \u00b6 59, and that the court had \u201cfully protected Mink\u2019s\nconstitutional rights in determining his competency,\u201d id. at \u00b6 61.\n        {\u00b6 225} Perhaps not every decision a defendant in a capital case makes that\nis against his or her interest should trigger a competency evaluation, but it would\nbehoove courts to proceed thoughtfully and cautiously. For example, a clinical\nexamination might not be required when a defendant wishes to waive representation\nby counsel. When making a decision like that, the defendant still has procedural\nand substantive protections in place. Courts should seek to examine a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency in view of the context and purpose of the proceeding. Therefore,\ncompetency evaluations should be specifically tailored to address the capacity and\nthe ability of the defendant to understand the ramifications of the specific adverse-\ninterest request he or she is making. See Westbrook v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 150, 150-\n151, 86 S.Ct. 1320, 16 L.Ed.2d 429 (1966).4\n\n4.

No. 2000-CR-2900 (June\n28, 2001):\n\n                 Applying the criteria set forth in State v. Ashworth (1999), 85 Ohio St.3d\n        56, [706 N.E.2d 1231,] and Based upon the Court\u2019s inquiry of the Defendant\n        conducted in open court and the competency reports of Dr. Thomas O. Martin and\n        Dr. Kim Stookey, the Court finds that the Defendant:\n                 1.) Understands the choice between life and death,\n                 2.) Has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to\n                 pursue the presentation of evidence,\n                 3.) Fully understands the ramifications of his decision,\n                 4.) Possesses the ability to reason logically, i.e. to choose means that\n                 relate logically to his ends,\n                 5.) Understands his right to present mitigating evidence,\n                 6.) Understands the meaning of mitigating evidence,\n                 7.) Understands the importance of mitigating evidence,\n                 8.) Understands the use of mitigating evidence to offset the aggravating\n                 circumstances and,\n                 9.) Understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence.\n                 The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n        presentation of mitigating evidence is made knowingly, intelligently and\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 226} Additionally, requiring that a record be developed when a\ndefendant invokes an adverse-interest request ensures balance in the system. If\nLawson had been asked further questions, his suicidal ideation and suicide attempt\nmay have become known to the court, as counsel presumably were aware of those\nmatters. At that point, any court would certainly have sought further information\nabout the defendant\u2019s mental health and capabilities before allowing the trial to\nproceed for the state to seek his execution. See Ashworth, 85 Ohio St.3d at 64, 706\nN.E.2d 1231 (noting the state\u2019s interest \u201cin not allowing the death penalty statute\nto be used as a means of state-assisted suicide\u201d).\n       {\u00b6 227} Because we must ensure rigorous compliance with constitutional\nstandards in capital cases, I cannot concur in affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentences\nunder our current framework of analysis.\n       II. The Validity of Lawson\u2019s Jury-Trial Waiver and Guilty Pleas\n       {\u00b6 228} Insofar as Lawson\u2019s claims that his waiver of a jury trial and pleas\nof guilty were not done knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, for the same\nreasons articulated above that the court should have ordered a competency\nexamination, I cannot concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record supports\nthat Lawson\u2019s pleas were fairly entered, underpinned by an adequate ability to\nreason and understand the proceedings against him.\n       {\u00b6 229} In accepting the waiver and pleas, even if the trial court had\ncomplied with State v. Ballard, 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 423 N.E.2d 115 (1981),\nparagraph one of the syllabus, and with Crim.R. 11, and even if the trial court had\nsufficiently inquired about Lawson\u2019s use of medications, Lawson was never asked\nwhy he wanted to enter the guilty pleas; his answer to that question may have\nclarified his lack of perceived or real duress, delusion, misunderstanding, or\nsuicidal motivation.\n\n       voluntarily. The Court therefore accepts the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n       presentation of mitigating evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 230} For these reasons, this court should be encouraging trial courts to\nthoroughly and appropriately examine a defendant\u2019s competency and state of mind\nwhen the defendant makes an adverse-interest request\u2014such as pleading guilty to\none or more capital offenses\u2014rather than tolerating trial courts\u2019 failures to comply\nwith R.C. 2945.37(B).\n                                  III. Conclusion\n       {\u00b6 231} Because this court should not endorse a death sentence when the\nconstitutionality of a defendant\u2019s convictions remains in doubt, I respectfully\ndissent from the majority\u2019s judgment. I would reverse Lawson\u2019s convictions and\nthe sentences of death. I would further remand this case for the trial court to order\na competency examination that it contemplated ordering before it accepted\nLawson\u2019s guilty pleas and to hold a hearing based on the findings and\nrecommendations contained in that evaluation, in accord with what I believe this\ncourt\u2019s holding should be, as expressed in this dissenting opinion.\n                               _________________\n       Brigham M.

Lawson, murdered four\npeople: Stacey Holston, her eight-year-old son D.H., her mother, Tammie McGuire,\nand her mother\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire. On October 13, Lawson surrendered\nto police and confessed to the murders.\n        {\u00b6 3} The Lawrence County grand jury returned an 11-count indictment,\nincluding four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications.\nLawson entered guilty pleas to all counts and specifications of the indictment.\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.06, a three-judge panel of the common pleas court heard the\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nstate\u2019s evidence of guilt with regard to the capital charges. The panel found Lawson\nguilty of four counts of aggravated murder with multiple death specifications as to\neach count. The panel then conducted a sentencing hearing and sentenced Lawson\nto death for each aggravated murder.\n       {\u00b6 4} In this appeal, Lawson raises five propositions of law. We overrule\neach of the propositions of law. After conducting an independent review, we\nconclude that although significant mitigating factors exist, the aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt as to each\nof the four aggravated murders. We further conclude that each death sentence is\nappropriate and proportionate. Therefore, we affirm all four death sentences.\n                 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                                     A. Facts\n       {\u00b6 5} Arron Lawson was Stacey Holston\u2019s first cousin. Stacey lived with\nher husband, Todd Holston, and their sons, D.H. and two-year-old B.H., near Pedro,\nOhio. Lawson lived nearby and was in the habit of visiting the Holstons daily.\n       {\u00b6 6} Lawson was infatuated with Stacey; he told his mother that she was\n\u201cthe love of his life.\u201d In his confession, he stated that he and Stacey had been\nhaving a sexual affair, which Stacey had broken off \u201c[a]bout a week ago,\u201d i.e.,\napproximately October 6, 2017.\n       {\u00b6 7} Lawson visited Stacey on Tuesday, October 10, 2017, the day before\nthe murders, while Todd was at work. During this visit, Lawson surreptitiously\nentered a bedroom at the back of the house, opened a window, and inserted a book\nbetween the window and the sill to hold the window partly open. By his own later\nadmission, he did this with the intention of entering the house the next day to\ncommit murder.\n       {\u00b6 8} At about 7:15 p.m., when Todd came home, Lawson was still there\nwith Stacey and the children. At Stacey\u2019s request, Todd drove Lawson home. Todd\ntestified at trial that Lawson \u201cwasn\u2019t too happy about\u201d being sent home.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The next morning, Todd left for work at approximately 4:30 a.m.\nAbout half an hour later, Lawson entered the Holstons\u2019 residence through the rear\nwindow. He had a 20-gauge shotgun, eight shells loaded with slugs, and a backpack\ncontaining flashlights, toilet paper, knives, a tarp, and other items. Lawson hid in\nthe back bedroom until about 8:30 a.m.\n       {\u00b6 10} Meanwhile, D.H.\u2019s school bus arrived and D.H. left the house to go\nto school. Stacey sent with him a note directing the school to put D.H. on a different\nbus that afternoon than he normally rode and to take him to his grandparents\u2019 house.\n       {\u00b6 11} By 8:30, after D.H. had left, Stacey was in the home with B.H.\nStacey entered the back bedroom where Lawson was hiding, and Lawson shot her\nthree times in the chest and shoulder. She fell to the floor.\n       {\u00b6 12} Lawson dragged her body to D.H.\u2019s bedroom where he lifted her\nonto a futon bed and, using a condom, had sex with her corpse. Lawson discarded\nthe condom in the kitchen wastebasket. He then returned to the bedroom and\ncovered Stacey\u2019s body with a blanket and the futon\u2019s mattress.\n       {\u00b6 13} As these events were occurring, Todd was at a worksite in Maysville,\nKentucky, where he clocked in at 6:43 a.m. It was Stacey\u2019s habit to send Todd a\ntext message early every morning to make sure he had arrived safely at work. When\nshe failed to do so on October 11, Todd began to worry. He repeatedly tried to call\nand text her throughout the day, but she did not respond.\n       {\u00b6 14} At 9:23 a.m., Lawson used Stacey\u2019s cell phone to call D.H.\u2019s school.\nPosing as Todd, Lawson told the school\u2019s guidance secretary that D.H.\u2019s\ngrandfather was unable to watch D.H. that day, so D.H. should be taken home on\nhis usual bus that afternoon. Lawson spoke calmly and gave the guidance secretary\nno reason to doubt he was who he claimed to be. Because Lawson was using\nStacey\u2019s phone, the phone number on the school\u2019s caller ID matched the number\non file in the office. So the original arrangement was canceled and D.H. was\nbrought home after school. Meanwhile, Lawson waited at the Holstons\u2019 residence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nHe fed B.H., changed his diaper, and later put him down for a nap in the main\nbedroom.\n        {\u00b6 15} When D.H. arrived home, Lawson sat with him in the living room\nand they talked about school. However, D.H. began asking Lawson where his\nmother was and when his father was coming home. Lacking answers, Lawson told\nD.H. that Lawson\u2019s PlayStation 3 was in D.H.\u2019s room behind the dresser. D.H.\nwent to his bedroom. As D.H. looked behind his dresser, Lawson shot him twice,\nonce in the arm and once in the torso. Lawson left the boy\u2019s body where it fell and\ncovered it with clothes. After killing D.H., Lawson continued to wait in the\nHolstons\u2019 residence.\n        {\u00b6 16} Around 6:30 or 6:40 p.m., Todd tried again to contact Stacey on his\nway home from his worksite. He then called Stacey\u2019s mother, Tammie McGuire,\nwho lived about a quarter mile from the Holstons. Tammie agreed to check on\nStacey and drove to the house. A few minutes later, she called Todd back and told\nhim that she was at his house but that the door was locked. Todd authorized her to\nbreak in, and she did. The phone connection remained open. A few minutes later,\nTodd heard Tammie scream, \u201cOh, my God\u201d followed by a loud noise. Then, as\nTodd later testified, \u201call of a sudden it was just quiet.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 17} By Lawson\u2019s account, he was in the main bedroom when he heard\nTammie forcing her way into the house. He hid behind the bedroom door; when\nTammie opened that door, he stepped out and shot her. Lawson dragged Tammie\u2019s\nbody to the laundry area and threw a blanket over her. He then used her keys to\nmove her truck behind the house.\n        {\u00b6 18} Meanwhile, Todd phoned Tammie\u2019s husband, Donald McGuire, and\napprised him of the situation. Donald said he would go and check, and he walked\nto the house.\n        {\u00b6 19} According to Lawson, Donald initially tried to enter through the\nback door, but it was locked, so Donald went around to the locked front door and\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u201crammed through.\u201d When Donald came in, Lawson shot him and dragged the body\nto D.H.\u2019s bedroom.\n        {\u00b6 20} About 10 to 20 minutes later, Todd arrived home. When he came\nthrough the front door, Lawson attacked him with a knife, stabbing him a number\nof times in the head, neck, and torso. Todd wrested the knife from Lawson and\npinned him to the couch.\n        {\u00b6 21} Todd asked Lawson why he had attacked him.            According to\nLawson, he then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was just a blind thing of anger.\u201d But\nTodd testified that Lawson had said, \u201cThere\u2019s been people breaking in out here, and\nI thought you was one of them.\u201d According to Todd, Lawson then \u201cshook like he\nsnapped out of something.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 22} Todd also asked Lawson where Stacey and the children were.\nLawson said they were in the bedroom and were \u201cokay.\u201d Todd testified that he\nthen forcefully removed Lawson from the house. Lawson drove away in the truck\nbelonging to the McGuires.\n        {\u00b6 23} Todd checked on B.H., who was unharmed. (According to Lawson,\nB.H. slept through at least the first three murders.) Todd then looked through the\nhouse. After finding the bodies of Tammie, Stacey, and Donald, he took B.H. and\ndrove to the McGuires\u2019 house, where he borrowed a cell phone from Tammie\u2019s\nbrother and called 9-1-1.\n        {\u00b6 24} Lawson had planned to hide out in the woods, but he had left his\nbackpack and shotgun behind in the Holstons\u2019 house, so he drove to a store. With\ncash stolen from the Holstons, he bought new clothes to replace his bloodstained\nones.\n        {\u00b6 25} While driving the truck, Lawson was pursued by police; he\nabandoned the truck and fled on foot. Eventually, he reached a wooded area, where\nhe spent the next two nights. Lawson later said that after one \u201ccold, cold night\u201d in\nthe woods, \u201cI just didn\u2019t have no more flight in me.\u201d Nevertheless, he did not\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nemerge from the woods until the morning of October 13, when he was apprehended.\nDetectives took him to the county prosecutor\u2019s office in Ironton, where he\nconfessed to the four murders.\n       {\u00b6 26} Dr. Robert Shott, the deputy Montgomery County coroner,\nperformed autopsies on all four victims. He testified that Stacey suffered two\nshotgun wounds to the chest and one to the back, fatally injuring her heart and\nlungs. D.H. was shot twice, receiving fatal wounds to the heart, lung, and aorta.\nTammie was shot once in the neck, fatally injuring her spinal cord, and once in the\nshoulder. Donald was shot once in the shoulder and once, fatally, in the chest.\n                              B. Procedural History\n       {\u00b6 27} On October 18, 2017, the grand jury indicted Lawson on four counts\nof aggravated murder with death specifications. Count 1 charged the aggravated\nmurder of Stacey Holston with prior calculation and design, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A).      Count 1 carried three death specifications: course of conduct\ninvolving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(5); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7),\npredicated on rape.\n       {\u00b6 28} Count 2 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of D.H., a child\nunder the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(C). This count carried six death\nspecifications: course of conduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder of a\nvictim younger than 13, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9); murder to escape\ndetection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated\non kidnapping; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Count 3 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Tammie\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Count 4 charged Lawson with the aggravated murder of Donald\nMcGuire during the commission of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(B). Counts 3 and 4 both carried four death specifications: a course of\nconduct, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment for other offenses, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(3); felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated on\naggravated burglary; and murder to prevent testimony, in violation of R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8).\n       {\u00b6 30} The indictment also included the following noncapital counts: Count\n5, attempted murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2903.02(A); Count 6,\nfelonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Count 7, aggravated burglary,\nin violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2); Count 8, rape, in violation of R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2); Count 9, abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B); Count\n10, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Count 11, tampering with\nevidence, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1); Count 12, theft of a motor vehicle, in\nviolation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(5); and Count 13, failure to comply with\na police officer\u2019s order, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B) and (C)(5)(a)(ii). Counts\n1 through 4 and Counts 7, 8, and 10 carried firearm specifications.\n       {\u00b6 31} On February 21, 2019, the state voluntarily dismissed the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(8) specifications that were attached to Counts 2, 3, and 4. Lawson then\nentered pleas of guilty to all remaining counts and specifications before the three-\njudge panel. Over the next few days, the three-judge panel heard witness testimony\nas required by R.C. 2945.06 and on February 25, 2019, unanimously found Lawson\nguilty of all counts of the indictment except Count 8 (rape) and of all specifications\nexcept the specification for felony murder predicated on rape that was attached to\nCount 1 (aggravated murder of Stacey).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The panel then held a mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C.\n2929.03(D)(1) beginning on February 26, 2019. After hearing the evidence that\nLawson offered in mitigation, the panel sentenced him to death on all four counts\nof aggravated murder. He also received sentences totaling 59 years and six months\non the noncapital counts and specifications. Lawson appeals of right and we now\naddress his propositions of law.\n      II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY\n                                     HEARING\n       {\u00b6 33} Lawson initially pleaded not guilty to the indictment. More than a\nyear later, he changed his mind, waived a jury trial, and entered guilty pleas to each\ncount of the indictment and to all the death specifications (except the three that the\nstate voluntarily dismissed). In so doing, he acted against his trial counsel\u2019s advice.\n       {\u00b6 34} Defense counsel never requested a hearing into Lawson\u2019s\ncompetence to stand trial. Nevertheless, in his first proposition of law, Lawson\ncontends that the trial court had a constitutional duty to inquire into his competence\nto stand trial before accepting his change of plea.\n                                 A. Relevant Facts\n       {\u00b6 35} On February 11, 2019, several days into the jury-selection process,\ndefense counsel informed the trial court that Lawson did not want a trial. In\nchambers, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys explained that Lawson did not want to put\nhimself, his family, and the families of the victims through a full trial \u201cwith all of\nthe gruesome photos that would be presented [and] all of the things that would be\n* * * said about him.\u201d Counsel said that he had explained to Lawson that if he\nentered a guilty plea, the case would proceed before a three-judge panel, not a jury.\n       {\u00b6 36} Defense counsel then observed:\n\n\n       I suppose * * * if he wants to do that, there\u2019s always a question of\n       whether or not there needs to be an examination of his competence\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        to waive jury in a capital case. Obviously that\u2019s not something that\n        we can [determine] today. And it may be something that would\n        require a psychological evaluation, although in a capital case, I\n        would ask for an independent one rather than what we would do in\n        a typical case.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 37} One of the prosecutors noted that the defense team included a\npsychologist, Dr. Bob Stinson, and asked whether Dr. Stinson could render an\nopinion on Lawson\u2019s competence. Defense counsel replied that he could not\n\u201ccommit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that,\u201d because a competency assessment is\n\u201ccompletely different\u201d from a mitigation assessment.        Nevertheless, defense\ncounsel noted that Dr. Stinson \u201c[o]bviously * * * would have more familiarity with\n[Lawson] than anyone else\u201d and stated that he \u201cassume[d] that it could be done in\na manner\u201d; he also stated that he had not \u201cthought through whether that would\ncreate some sort of a conflict in terms of what [Dr. Stinson\u2019s] testimony would be\nin the mitigation phase.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 38} The trial judge then stated that he had \u201cbrought this up months ago\non the potential for a competency evaluation\u201d but that he had declined to order one\nbecause the defense had opposed it. (Any previous discussions of competency\nissues must have occurred off the record, as the transcript does not reflect any\ndiscussion of a competency evaluation before February 11.) The trial judge\ncontinued, \u201cI\u2019m now second-guessing myself that I should have [ordered] it over\nobjection.\u201d       Defense counsel remarked that the court was \u201cnot incorrect\u201d in\ndeclining to order an evaluation over the defense\u2019s opposition. The prosecutor\npointed out that the defense had not raised a question about Lawson\u2019s competence\nto stand trial.\n        {\u00b6 39} At the request of defense counsel, the court took a recess so that\nLawson could discuss the matter with his family. When the session resumed,\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefense counsel told the court at a bench conference that \u201cafter much thought,\nconsideration, [and] discussion with family members and counsel,\u201d Lawson had\ndecided not to change his plea and would proceed with a jury trial. The court then\nresumed the jury-selection process and the prospective jurors were brought into the\ncourtroom.\n       {\u00b6 40} The next day, however, Lawson\u2019s counsel informed the trial court\nthat Lawson had decided to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea\nto a three-judge panel. The trial court questioned Lawson at length about whether\nhe understood that he was waiving his constitutional right to have a jury hear and\ndecide the case. Lawson affirmatively stated a number of times that he understood\nthe consequences of his decision.\n       {\u00b6 41} During this exchange, the trial court asked Lawson whether he had\nconsulted with his family about his decision.          Lawson answered that after\nconsulting with his family the previous day, he \u201chad a second thought throughout\nthe night.\u201d He informed the trial court that \u201cit was a little rough because I saw my\nmom crying and it always plays on my heart. And then after a while I have to make\na better decision for my life and not somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 42} The trial court accepted Lawson\u2019s waiver. Lawson\u2019s counsel then\nfiled a written waiver of jury trial that Lawson had signed.

Analysis\n      a. Were there sufficient indicia of incompetence to require a hearing?\n       {\u00b6 52} Lawson acknowledges that his counsel never asked for a\ncompetency evaluation, but he contends that the trial court denied him due process\nby not ordering one sua sponte. He contends that the record in this case establishes\nsufficient \u201cindicia of incompetence\u201d to require a hearing.\n       {\u00b6 53} Three facts, Lawson contends, called his competence into question.\nFirst, his decision to waive a jury trial and plead guilty to the indictment was made\nagainst the advice of his counsel. Second, he displayed \u201cindecision,\u201d in that he\nchanged his mind about pleading guilty. Third, at the time of his plea, he \u201cwas\nbeing treated with psychiatric medications,\u201d a fact he disclosed to the trial court\nduring the plea colloquy.\n       {\u00b6 54} Lawson\u2019s acting against the advice of counsel does not indicate\nincompetence. We have noted that a defendant\u2019s \u201crefusal to heed his counsel\u2019s\nadvice * * * [does] not indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of the\ncharges and proceedings or the gravity of the situation or that he could not assist in\nhis defense.\u201d State v.

The record shows that after first expressing his desire to plead guilty\non February 11, 2019, Lawson discussed the matter with his counsel and family\nand then decided not to change his plea. The next day, however, he filed his written\njury waiver. The record does not show that he changed his mind again. On\nFebruary 21, he still wished to plead guilty, and he did so without further hesitation.\n       {\u00b6 56} It is not surprising that a defendant contemplating entering a guilty\nplea in a capital case would display some hesitation. \u201cIndecisiveness is not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsame as incompetency[,] however.\u201d Johnson v.

However, once he distanced\nhimself from those emotions and further reflected, he knew that the best decision\nfor him was to change his not-guilty plea to a plea of guilty.\n       {\u00b6 57} In any event, Lawson\u2019s change of mind was brief. Having decided\nto plead guilty on February 12, he held to his decision in the face of his counsel\u2019s\ncontrary advice and after a rigorous plea colloquy. And he continued to hold to his\ndecision over the ensuing nine days and during the change-of-plea hearing before\nthe three-judge panel. This sequence of events has no tendency to show that\nLawson lacked the ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding, nor does it suggest that he was unable to understand the\nproceedings.\n       {\u00b6 58} Finally, Lawson cites his statement during the plea colloquy that he\nwas taking prescription medication. The presiding judge asked Lawson whether he\nwas \u201cpresently under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or mind-altering\nsubstance.\u201d Lawson replied: \u201cI\u2019m under prescription medication, but that is all.\u201d\nHe stated that he was taking naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and Zoloft.\n       {\u00b6 59} However, \u201cit is a matter of statutory and decisional law that \u2018[t]he\nfact that a defendant is taking antidepressant medication or prescribed psychotropic\ndrugs does not negate his competence to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">148 Ohio\nSt.3d 347</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4027840\"><a href=\"/opinion/4250579/state-v-montgomery-slip-opinion/\">2016-Ohio-5487</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">71 N.E.3d 180</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 56, quoting State v.

Did the trial court raise the issue of competency?\n       {\u00b6 66} Lawson contends that \u201cthe [trial] court itself effectively raised the\nissue\u201d of his competence\u2014presumably on February 11, 2019, when the court\nwondered out loud whether it should have ordered a competency hearing earlier in\nthe case over the defense\u2019s objections. Lawson relies on State v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 Ohio\nSt.3d 108</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">502 N.E.2d 1016</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), in which this court stated: \u201c[T]here is no\nquestion that where the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is raised\nprior to the trial, a competency hearing is mandatory.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.37(B).\nLawson\u2019s argument is not clear, but he seems to imply that a competency hearing\nwas required under Bock because the trial court itself had \u201craised\u201d the issue of\ncompetence.\n       {\u00b6 67} We disagree. While a trial court may raise the issue of a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency, see R.C. 2945.37(B), the trial court in this case was not exercising this\nauthority. In essence, the trial court was asking the defense whether it wanted a\ncompetency hearing. Asking the defense whether it wants a hearing does not by\nitself make a hearing mandatory. The fact that the trial court did not order a\ncompetency evaluation and hearing, when it had the authority to sua sponte do so,\nshows that the court did not intend to raise the issue of Lawson\u2019s competence.\nMoreover, even if a competency hearing were mandatory under Bock, the failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nhold one would be harmless error in this case: \u201c[I]t is clear that the failure to hold\na mandatory competency hearing is harmless error where the record fails to reveal\nsufficient indicia of incompetency.\u201d Bock at 110.\n                    4. No support for the dissent\u2019s per se rule\n        {\u00b6 68} As set forth above, the Supreme Court has established, and Ohio has\nadopted, specific procedures to adequately protect an incompetent defendant from\nbeing tried or convicted. The dissent, however, advocates for the adoption of a per\nse rule\u2014that a competency examination and hearing are required at the instant in\nwhich a capital defendant pursues an adverse-interest request, such as entering a\nplea of guilty.\n        {\u00b6 69} There is no compelling reason to adopt that per se rule. As the Fifth\nCircuit has held:\n\n\n        [W]e decline to adopt a per se rule that, as a matter of law, a trial\n        court must doubt a capital punishment defendant\u2019s competency, or\n        conclude that such defendant does not understand the proceedings\n        against him or appreciate their significance, or conclude that he\n        cannot rationally aid his attorney in his defense simply because it is\n        obvious to the court that the defendant is causing his trial to be\n        conducted in a manner most likely to result in a conviction and the\n        imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\nRoberts v.

INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n        {\u00b6 93} In his third proposition of law, Lawson contends that his trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance. To establish ineffective assistance, Lawson must\nshow (1) deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective\nstandard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been\ndifferent. Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">466 U.S. 668</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687-688, 694, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">104 S.Ct. 2052</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\">80 L.Ed.2d 674</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984); State v.

Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation\n        {\u00b6 94} Lawson argues that his counsel should have requested a competency\nevaluation, which would have led to a competency hearing.\n        {\u00b6 95} R.C. 2945.37(B) entitles the defense to a pretrial competency\nhearing upon request: \u201cIn a criminal action in a court of common pleas, * * * the\ncourt, prosecutor, or defense may raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to\nstand trial. If the issue is raised before the trial has commenced, the court shall\nhold a hearing on the issue as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense\ncounsel is not ineffective in failing to request that the trial court order a competency\nevaluation or hold a competency hearing when the defendant does not display\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nsufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. State v.\nThomas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">97 Ohio St.3d 309</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2002-Ohio-6624</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">779 N.E.2d 1017</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 96} Lawson contends that counsel\u2019s decision not to request a\ncompetency evaluation cannot be justified as a strategic decision, because\nrequesting an evaluation would have had no possible \u201cdownside.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 97} Lawson\u2019s assertion that there is no downside to requesting a\ncompetency evaluation in this type of situation is questionable: defense counsel\nmay risk straining their relationship with their client when they question his mental\ncompetence and seek to negate his decisions. But in any event, competent counsel\nwould not request an evaluation unless they had some reason to doubt the\ndefendant\u2019s competence. Here, nothing in the record shows that Lawson\u2019s counsel\nhad any such reason.\n       {\u00b6 98} Lawson contends that his counsel did not adequately investigate the\ncompetency issue before declining to request a competency evaluation. He argues\nthat an expert opinion on Lawson\u2019s competence was essential, because counsel\u2019s\n\u201carmchair opinions\u201d were not a sufficient basis on which to make such a decision.\nHe further argues that the record fails to show that defense counsel ever sought an\nexpert opinion.\n       {\u00b6 99} Lawson points to defense counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court on\nFebruary 11, 2019, the day Lawson first announced that he wanted to waive a jury\nand plead guilty. One of the prosecutors asked whether Dr. Stinson could render\nan opinion on competence based on conversations Dr. Stinson and Lawson had\nalready had. One of Lawson\u2019s attorneys replied:\n\n\n               I can\u2019t commit Dr. Stinson to being able to do that. I know\n       psychologists that I have worked with in the past would probably\n       say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a completely different review and assessment,\u201d\n       and they\u2019re looking for different things than the context of\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       presenting possible psychological information for purposes of\n       mitigation.\n               Obviously [Dr. Stinson] would have more familiarity with\n       this young man than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be\n       done in a manner, although I * * * haven\u2019t thought through whether\n       that would create some sort of a conflict in terms of what his\n       testimony would be in the mitigation phase.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Lawson reads this statement as indicating \u201cthe limited scope of Dr.\nStinson\u2019s services[,] which did not include a competency examination.\u201d But\ndefense counsel did not say that Dr. Stinson could not render such an assessment.\nHe said only that he could not guarantee that Dr. Stinson would be able to form an\nopinion of Lawson\u2019s competence based on the interviewing Dr. Stinson had done\nup to that point. Indeed, counsel went on to say that Dr. Stinson \u201cwould have more\nfamiliarity with [Lawson] than anyone else, and so I assume that it could be done\nin a manner.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n       {\u00b6 101} Lawson goes on to assert that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that\nindicates that Dr. Stinson or any other mental health professional did, or was even\nasked to do, a competency evaluation on\u201d Lawson. Lawson\u2019s argument misplaces\nthe burden of persuasion: a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal must show from the record that the elements of the claim\nexist. Therefore, Lawson must show that his counsel failed to perform an adequate\ninvestigation of his possible incompetence. See, e.g., State v. Were, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">118 Ohio St.3d\n448</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2008-Ohio-2762</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">890 N.E.2d 263</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 244.\n       {\u00b6 102} Lawson also ignores what defense counsel said during the plea\nhearing on February 21. During that hearing, one of Lawson\u2019s attorneys expressly\nstated that counsel had conducted an investigation into competency issues and that\nthey had consulted Dr. Stinson:\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n               JUDGE BALLARD: * * * [A]t any point did you ever have\n       any concerns that might be raised by Adkins [sic, Atkins v.

MCVAY [defense counsel]: Not being a psychologist\n       or a psychiatrist * * * I\u2019m not in a position * * * to technically\n       answer that. But based on my many years of experience and 24\n       years as a practicing attorney handling a substantial number of death\n       penalty cases * * * and having had clients who would be Adkins-\n       qualified or otherwise incompetent to enter a plea, * * * I have no\n       reason to think that Mr. Lawson would fall into any of those\n       categories at this point in time based upon my discussions with him\n       and many hours spent with him, over 17 months, as well as the time\n       spent with him today.\n\n\n(Capitalization sic.)\n       {\u00b6 103} The presiding judge then asked counsel: \u201c[I]s it safe for this panel\nto assume that you conducted appropriate investigation from your practice into any\nissue that would be addressed by Adkins or mental issues or competency issues?\u201d\nCounsel replied:\n\n\n               We did, your Honor. In keeping with the American Bar\n       Association Guidelines for the Representation of Defendants\n       Charged with Capital Crimes and their recommendation, if not\n       insistence, that we engage a forensic psychologist to work with and\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       examine the defendant in the course of our representation, * * * that\n       in fact has been done. * * *\n               Having said that, and having discussed matters with * * *\n       Dr. Stinson at length, I think I can fairly represent that by virtue of\n       the fact that we have not filed any pleadings pertaining to a possible\n       incompetency to proceed in this matter * * *, I feel that we\u2019re on\n       safe ground in that respect in the sense that we have done our due\n       diligence with regard to that * * *. We have looked into all of those\n       matters, discussed most, * * * I would suggest all of those matters\n       with Mr. Lawson. I believe that we\u2019re on solid ground to move\n       forward with what his intentions are at this point in time.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) This statement indicates that Dr. Stinson examined Lawson and\nthat defense counsel consulted Dr. Stinson in determining whether to further pursue\nthe issue of Lawson\u2019s competence. Lawson cites nothing in the record that either\ncontradicts counsel\u2019s representations or shows that the investigation that had been\nconducted was deficient.\n       {\u00b6 104} Finally, Lawson is unable to show prejudice resulting from\ncounsel\u2019s declining to request a competency evaluation. It is true that if Lawson\u2019s\ncounsel had requested an evaluation, the trial court would have been required by\nstatute to order one.   But that says nothing about the likely outcome of the\nevaluation and of the hearing. To show prejudice, Lawson must show that there is\na reasonable probability that an evaluation \u201cwould have revealed that he was\nincompetent to stand trial,\u201d Alexander v. Dugger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">841 F.2d 371</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (11th\nCir.1988).\n       {\u00b6 105} As we concluded in relation to Lawson\u2019s first proposition of law,\nthe record simply contains insufficient indicia of incompetence to require a\ncompetency evaluation or a competency hearing. If defense counsel had requested\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\na competency evaluation, the trial court would have had to hold a hearing. But the\nalleged indicia of incompetence that Lawson repeatedly cites would have been\ninsufficient to overcome the legal presumption of competence, because they do not\nsuggest that Lawson was incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the\nproceedings against him or of assisting in his own defense. The record of the\npenalty phase contains numerous references to Lawson\u2019s mental-health history,\nincluding diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, and posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). However, \u201c[i]ncompetency must not be equated with mere\nmental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be\nemotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the\ncharges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d Bock, 28 Ohio St.3d at 110, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">502\nN.E.2d 1016</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Accordingly, the record does not show a reasonable likelihood that\nthe trial court would have found Lawson incompetent to stand trial.\n              B. Failure to Argue Mercy As a Mitigating Factor\n       {\u00b6 106} In another part of his third proposition of law, Lawson contends\nthat his counsel were ineffective because they failed to renew a pretrial motion to\ninstruct the jury on mercy as a mitigating factor and because they did not argue\nduring the penalty phase that mercy was a mitigating factor.\n       {\u00b6 107} As the state points out, any issues concerning jury instructions\nbecame moot once Lawson waived a jury trial. However, Lawson also contends\nthat counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to argue before the three-\njudge panel that mercy is a mitigating factor. That facet of his claim is obviously\nnot rendered moot by Lawson\u2019s jury waiver.\n       {\u00b6 108} However, the claim lacks merit, as we have repeatedly held that\nmercy is not a mitigating factor. See, e.g., State v. Belton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">149 Ohio St.3d 165</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3195810\"><a href=\"/opinion/3195916/state-v-belton-slip-opinion/\">2016-Ohio-1581</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">74 N.E.3d 319</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 88; State v.

Hence, counsel did not perform deficiently by\ndeclining to argue otherwise.     \u201cDefense counsel is not required to advance\n\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\narguments lacking merit. * * * It is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to\nmaneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested or rejected legal\ntheories.\u201d State v. McNeill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">83 Ohio St.3d 438</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">700 N.E.2d 596</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).\n       {\u00b6 109} Lawson also fails to show prejudice. Defense counsel in this case\npresented extensive mitigating evidence focused on Lawson\u2019s dysfunctional family\nand upbringing, his alleged abuse, traumatic events in his life, and his diagnosed\nmental disorders. Their penalty-phase arguments to the panel concentrated on that\nevidence. Lawson does not explain how adding an express plea for mercy would\nhave been reasonably likely to make a difference in the penalty-phase outcome.\n       {\u00b6 110} We overrule Lawson\u2019s third proposition of law.\n                          V. SENTENCING OPINION\n       {\u00b6 111} In his fourth proposition of law, Lawson contends that errors in the\npanel\u2019s sentencing opinion require that we vacate his death sentences. He contends\nthat the panel improperly weighed nonstatutory aggravating circumstances against\nhim and improperly discounted the mitigating factors. We disagree.\n                 A. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 112} The trial court\u2019s 12-page sentencing opinion begins with a\nstatement of facts. According to Lawson, the opinion includes several facts that\n\u201cmade the crime particularly disturbing\u201d and could only \u201cbe termed as\ninflammatory.\u201d Lawson contends that by mentioning these facts in the opinion, the\npanel \u201cemployed\u201d them as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\n       {\u00b6 113} The \u201cinflammatory\u201d facts Lawson refers to include the following:\nthat Lawson had sexual intercourse with Stacey\u2019s body after shooting her, that\nStacey had recently ended a sexual relationship with Lawson, that Lawson posed\nas D.H.\u2019s father to deceive D.H.\u2019s school into sending him home that day, that\nLawson \u201ctricked\u201d D.H. into entering the bedroom and shot him twice at close range,\nthat Lawson prepared in advance for the murders by propping a window open the\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nnight before, that he moved and covered the bodies, and that he was arrested two\ndays later \u201c[a]fter a manhunt.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 114} But a trial court does not \u201ccreate nonstatutory aggravating\ncircumstances\u201d merely by \u201cdiscussing the facts of the crime.\u201d State v. Robb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">88\nOhio St.3d 59</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">723 N.E.2d 1019</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). Moreover, the sentencing opinion here\ncorrectly identified the aggravating circumstances of which Lawson was found\nguilty as to each aggravated-murder count. When a trial court has correctly\nidentified the statutory aggravating circumstances pleaded and proved at trial, we\npresume that the trial court understood the difference between statutory aggravating\ncircumstances and the facts that describe the nature and circumstances of the\noffense. State v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">151 Ohio St.3d 470</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4202918\"><a href=\"/opinion/4425665/state-v-martin-slip-opinion/\">2017-Ohio-7556</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">90 N.E.3d 857</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\u00b6 137.\n         {\u00b6 115} Lawson points to nothing in the opinion that suggests that the panel\nused the facts as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. Instead, he contends that\nthe opinion fails to affirmatively state that the facts were not so used, and he argues\nthat this failure suffices to rebut the presumption that the trial court considered only\nthe aggravating circumstances to which Lawson pleaded guilty. However, the\nopinion does specifically state that the panel did not consider Lawson\u2019s alleged\naffair with Stacey or the other \u201coffenses charged in the indictment,\u201d which would\ninclude his abuse of Stacey\u2019s corpse, as aggravating circumstances.\n         {\u00b6 116} Lawson\u2019s argument is inconsistent with our precedent.             The\nopinion \u201cidentified only the applicable statutory aggravating circumstances * * *\nand listed no improper nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.

INDEPENDENT SENTENCE REVIEW\n       {\u00b6 126} Under R.C. 2929.05, we must independently review Lawson\u2019s\ndeath sentences. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires that we determine (1) whether the\nevidence supports the trier of fact\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, (2)\nwhether the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty\noutweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) whether the\ndeath sentences are proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.\n                        A. Aggravating Circumstances\n       {\u00b6 127} The aggravated murder of Stacey Holston (Count 1) has two\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)), and a felony-\nmurder circumstance predicated on aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)).\n       {\u00b6 128} The aggravated murder of D.H. (Count 2) has five aggravating\ncircumstances: murder of a victim under age 13 (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)); murder\ncommitted to escape detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another\noffense (R.C 2929.04(A)(3)); course of conduct; felony murder predicated on\naggravated burglary; and felony murder predicated on kidnapping.\n       {\u00b6 129} The aggravated murder of Tammie McGuire (Count 3) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 130} The aggravated murder of Donald McGuire (Count 4) has three\naggravating circumstances: course of conduct; murder to escape detection,\napprehension, trial, or punishment; and felony murder predicated on aggravated\nburglary.\n       {\u00b6 131} The evidence in the record, including Lawson\u2019s confession,\nsupports the panel\u2019s finding as to each of the aggravating circumstances.\n                              B. Mitigating Factors\n       {\u00b6 132} Against these aggravating circumstances, we must weigh any of the\nrelevant mitigating factors provided in R.C. 2929.04(B). These factors include\n\u2022      the nature and circumstances of the offense, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      the history, character, and background of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B),\n\u2022      whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it, R.C.\n       2929.04(B)(1),\n\u2022      whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for\n       the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation,\n       R.C. 2929.04(B)(2),\n\u2022      whether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a\n       mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the\n       criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct\n       to the requirements of the law, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3),\n\u2022      the youth of the offender, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4),\n\u2022      the offender\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and\n       delinquency adjudications, R.C. 2929.04(B)(5),\n\u2022      if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,\n       the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          the offender\u2019s participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim,\n          R.C. 2929.04(B)(6),\n\u2022         and any other factors that are relevant to the issue whether the offender\n          should be sentenced to death, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\n                                         1. Age\n          {\u00b6 133} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), \u201c[t]he youth of the offender\u201d is a\nmitigating factor. Lawson was born in 1994 and was 23 years old when he\ncommitted these murders. Lawson\u2019s age \u201cqualifies as a mitigating factor under\nR.C. 2929.04(B)(4).\u201d State v.

Dr. Stinson testified that the human brain\ncontinues to develop until a person reaches his mid-20s. He specifically noted that\nthe frontal lobe\u2014which is responsible for things like judgment, reasoning, impulse\ncontrol, and planning\u2014is the last part of the brain to develop and does not reach\nfull development until the mid-20s.\n                                2. Prior Criminal History\n          {\u00b6 135} Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(5), \u201c[t]he offender\u2019s lack of a significant\nhistory of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications\u201d is a mitigating\nfactor.    The trial court found that Lawson has no previous convictions or\ndelinquency adjudications.\n                             3. Mental Disease or Defect\n          {\u00b6 136} The diminished-capacity mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), is\ninapplicable. Although Lawson has been diagnosed with various mental disorders,\nincluding bipolar disorder, Dr. Stinson did not testify that any of them deprived him\nof \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform\n[his] conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(3).

History, Character, and Background\n       {\u00b6 137} Lawson\u2019s history, character, and background constituted the heart\nof his case in mitigation. In the penalty phase, Lawson presented three witnesses:\nCarolyn Taylor, Stephanie Bentley, and Dr. Stinson. Carolyn Taylor is Lawson\u2019s\nmother. Stephanie Bentley is his half-sister and Carolyn\u2019s daughter. Dr. Stinson\ninterviewed Lawson for a total of 12 hours during four sessions and also\ninterviewed Lawson\u2019s mother. He reviewed information obtained by a mitigation\nspecialist who had conducted interviews of Lawson, his mother, his stepmother\nMartha Lawson, his half-sisters Stephanie Bentley and Summer Riesner, and others\nfamiliar with Lawson and his family. Dr. Stinson reviewed children\u2019s services,\neducational, employment, medical, mental-health, and jail records pertaining to\nLawson, records pertaining to Carolyn Taylor\u2019s family background and upbringing,\nand other records.\n       {\u00b6 138} Dr. Stinson identified 11 \u201cadverse childhood experiences\u201d\n(\u201cACEs\u201d) that place a child at risk for adverse health, mental-health, and social\noutcomes. They are physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical\nneglect, emotional neglect, \u201cintimate partner violence,\u201d violence against the\nmother, \u201csubstance misuse in the household,\u201d parental divorce or separation,\nmental illness of a household member, and the incarceration of a household\nmember. Dr. Stinson testified that a research study conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention found that ACEs relate to approximately 40\nnegative outcomes. The presence of four or five ACEs indicates \u201csignificantly\nincreased risk for negative outcomes,\u201d and the likelihood of negative outcomes\nrises with the number of ACEs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 139} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson had experienced \u201cat least\u201d nine\nACEs. The only two Dr. Stinson failed to definitively find were sexual abuse and\nphysical neglect.\n         {\u00b6 140} Lawson was born in April 1994. His parents are Delbert \u201cRay\u201d\nLawson and Carolyn Taylor. He was the third of five children Carolyn had by five\ndifferent men. Both of Lawson\u2019s parents have been divorced and remarried\nmultiple times. Carolyn has lived on welfare, food stamps, and Social Security\ndisability benefits.\n         {\u00b6 141} Ray and Carolyn lived together for about a month; when Carolyn\nbecame pregnant with Lawson, Ray left her. Carolyn lost custody of Lawson in\n1995. Ray denied his paternity until a DNA test proved that he was Lawson\u2019s\nfather; after that, he sought and was awarded custody of Lawson. According to Dr.\nStinson, Martha Lawson recalled that Carolyn had dropped Lawson off at Ray and\nMartha\u2019s house coatless in the middle of a winter night with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s your\nturn.\u201d\n         {\u00b6 142} Lawson lived with Ray and Martha until he was 16. Also living in\nthe Lawson household were Ray and Martha\u2019s son Ray Jr. and Martha\u2019s son James\nMunyon. Carolyn was entitled to visitation with Lawson on Wednesdays and\nalternate weekends.    However, she testified that sometimes Ray and Martha\ndeprived Lawson of a visit as a punishment.\n         {\u00b6 143} While living with Ray and Martha, Lawson was especially close to\nhis paternal aunt, Linda McFann. Carolyn testified that Linda was \u201clike a second\nmom\u201d to him. Unfortunately, Linda died in a house fire. Carolyn testified that\nLawson was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Linda\u2019s death. Dr. Stinson testified that Linda died\nin 2006, when Lawson was about 12 years old. According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson\nstill had not \u201cresolved\u201d his bereavement five years later. At that time, a neighbor\ntold Lawson that he was glad Linda was dead, and Lawson responded by\n\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nthreatening the neighbor with a butcher knife. Lawson was hospitalized at a\nmental-health facility after this incident.\n        {\u00b6 144} Lawson was also quite close to the boyfriend of one of his aunts,\nwhom he called \u201cUncle Tracy.\u201d Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Tracy was the most\npositive influence in his life. But Tracy died of a heroin overdose in about 2016.\n        {\u00b6 145} When Lawson was 16, Ray and Martha divorced, and Ray moved\nto Kentucky, leaving his children behind. Custody of Lawson then reverted to\nCarolyn, who had married Carl Kelly. A few months later, Carolyn and Kelly broke\nup, but Lawson continued to live with Kelly, whom Bentley described as like a\nfather to Lawson. Dr. Stinson believed that Kelly was generally a positive influence\non Lawson and may have provided \u201csome positive role modeling.\u201d On the other\nhand, Bentley testified that Kelly sold a lot of marijuana and provided some of it to\nLawson. After moving out, Carolyn maintained contact with Lawson, seeing him\nevery few days and talking to him on the phone.\n        {\u00b6 146} Dr. Stinson described the \u201ccomplicated family structure\u201d within\nwhich Lawson was raised. Ray left Lawson\u2019s mother to marry Martha, and\nLawson\u2019s mother had a relationship with Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon, who was\nthe father of Lawson\u2019s half-sister Stephanie Bentley. Lawson was teased in school\nbecause of this \u201cweird\u201d family situation. Additionally, Lawson\u2019s grandfather\nfathered a child with one of his daughters-in-law (Lawson\u2019s aunt by marriage); that\nchild was referred to as Lawson\u2019s \u201cUncle Cuz\u201d because he was both uncle and\ncousin to Lawson.\n        {\u00b6 147} Since at least age 11, Lawson has repeatedly alleged that his father,\nstepmother, and other family members abused him. He described his father as an\n\u201cabusive asshole\u201d who would get drunk and punch him.\n        {\u00b6 148} Carolyn testified that during visitations, she sometimes saw\nunexplained injuries on Lawson. Once she saw stitches in his head. She said that\nsomeone once squeezed Lawson\u2019s ears so tightly that they were severely bruised\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand had turned black. Bentley remembered seeing this as well, but she never saw\nany other bruising or injures. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that Martha would pinch his\nears to the point of bruising and would strike him in the face.\n       {\u00b6 149} On one occasion, Carolyn testified, a dark orange substance was\ndraining from Lawson\u2019s ear. Carolyn recalled that when she took Lawson to a\ndoctor to treat his ear, the doctor said that it looked as if someone had jabbed the\nmetal end of a pencil into Lawson\u2019s ear after removing the eraser.\n       {\u00b6 150} Dr. Stinson testified that according to the medical records he\nreviewed, there were two cases of drainage from Lawson\u2019s ears. The first instance\nof \u201cbloody drainage\u201d occurred when Lawson was three; almost a year later, Lawson\nexperienced the orange discharge that had been described by Carolyn from the same\near.   According to Dr. Stinson, medical records documented that Lawson\u2019s\nstepbrother, James Munyon, had shoved pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears; however, Dr.\nStinson did not make clear whether this behavior had caused the discharges.\n       {\u00b6 151} Dr. Stinson admitted that to his knowledge, no specific instances of\nabuse against Lawson had ever been substantiated. And although Dr. Stinson\nbelieved that Lawson was a victim of abuse, he eventually conceded that he did not\nknow whether Lawson had been abused. (Dr. Stinson did not classify the alleged\ninsertion of pencils into Lawson\u2019s ears as a type of \u201cabuse.\u201d)\n       {\u00b6 152} Dr. Stinson also testified that Lawson reported abuse \u201cover and\nover and over to people who did nothing.\u201d Dr. Stinson felt that the fact that\nLawson\u2019s claims went unheeded was actually \u201cmore relevant\u201d than whether he\nactually was abused, because it contributed to his feelings of being unloved:\n\n\n       We can look back on it and say \u201cWell, it * * * really wasn\u2019t abuse.\u201d\n       From my standpoint what\u2019s more relevant is the fact that once he\n       reported his abuse, nobody did anything about it * * * and he\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       internalized [the belief that] nobody cares, nobody\u2019s going to protect\n       me, nobody loves me and I\u2019m unlovable.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 153} Lawson did tell his mother that he was being abused, and his\nmedical records showed that he reported past abuse to medical-health professionals\nduring his treatment sessions.\n       {\u00b6 154} However, when Lawson first alleged to authorities that he was\nbeing abused, the authorities did not ignore it; they investigated and found no\nevidence to support the claim. The penalty-phase evidence includes records for\nLawson and his family from the Lawrence County Department of Job and Family\nServices that were admitted as a court\u2019s exhibit. Those records include a children\u2019s\nservices report showing that Ray and Martha were investigated in 2006 after\nLawson reported to the Ironton police that he was being abused.\n       {\u00b6 155} According to the records, Lawson alleged that his stepmother\nslapped his face, his siblings \u201cput erasers in his ears,\u201d and his parents \u201chit him\neverywhere.\u201d But the investigator found only one small bruise on Lawson\u2019s knee,\nand that appeared to the investigator to be normal for a preteen child and to not\nhave been deliberately inflicted.\n       {\u00b6 156} The investigator learned that Lawson\u2019s father had recently spanked\nhim with a belt; however, the spanking was inflicted as a punishment after Lawson\nchoked his brother, Ray Jr., during a squabble. Martha told the investigator that\nLawson had expressed a desire \u201cto get his father in trouble like he was in trouble\nfrom choking\u201d his brother.\n       {\u00b6 157} Although Lawson has never reported that he was sexually abused\nand in fact has denied it, Dr. Stinson nonetheless suspected that Lawson may have\nbeen sexually abused as a child. He based this suspicion on the existence of\n\u201crampant\u201d sexual abuse in Lawson\u2019s family over the years. Carolyn\u2019s oldest son\nwas allegedly sexually abused and went on to abuse two sisters and a cousin.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLawson\u2019s stepbrother was sexually abused by a neighbor. One of Lawson\u2019s half-\nsisters was sexually abused by Carolyn\u2019s brother-in-law. A generation before,\nCarolyn\u2019s family members had been involved in numerous allegations of sexual\nabuse. Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson may have denied being sexually abused\nbecause it was so common as to become \u201cnormalized\u201d in his family.\n       {\u00b6 158} Lawson\u2019s mother, Carolyn Taylor, was raised in poverty; her\nfamily was dependent on welfare and food stamps, and the children were\nmalnourished. Carolyn grew up in a trailer that housed 12 people. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that \u201cthere were concerns that the boys and the girls were sharing bedrooms\nand sleeping together.\u201d The home was leaky and roach-infested and had no indoor\nbathroom.\n       {\u00b6 159} During Carolyn\u2019s childhood, numerous allegations of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and neglect were leveled against her parents and stepparents;\nmany of them were against her father in particular.             Children\u2019s services\ninvestigators were able to substantiate some of these allegations, but according to\nDr. Stinson, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, Dr. Stinson\ntestified that the \u201cremarkable\u201d number of allegations said a great deal about the\nculture of Carolyn\u2019s family.\n       {\u00b6 160} Dr. Stinson also stated that Carolyn suffered from \u201csignificant\nmental health problems.\u201d Documented symptoms he listed included agitation,\nanhedonia (loss of interest in pleasurable activities), anxiety, crying spells,\ndisorganized thought, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, homicidal and\nsuicidal thoughts, hyperactivity, paranoia, panic attacks, phobic avoidance,\npreoccupation, self-mutilation, and feelings of worthlessness.          Her \u201cmood\ndisturbance\u201d manifested itself in the forms of severe depression, anger, euphoria,\nirritability, mania, and \u201cmixed moods,\u201d i.e., simultaneous symptoms of depression\nand mania.\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 161} Dr. Stinson related that Carolyn had been diagnosed with anxiety\ndisorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, \u201cmoderate and recurrent\u201d major depressive\ndisorder, various forms of bipolar disorder including \u201cmixed [simultaneously manic\nand depressive] severe, with psychotic features,\u201d and schizoaffective disorder, a\npsychotic disorder combining schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She had been\ntreated with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. Carolyn\u2019s\ndoctor had determined that her mental disorders left her \u201cfunctionally impaired,\u201d\nunable to carry on day-to-day activities. The Social Security Administration had\nfound that she was \u201cpermanently impaired and unable to engage in any gainful\nactivity.\u201d\n        {\u00b6 162} According to Dr. Stinson, Lawson also had three relatives\u2014an\nuncle, aunt, and great-uncle\u2014who had attempted suicide. And Lawson described\na maternal half-brother as \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d and as having delusions. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that severe mental-health problems have a genetic component, so that the\nchildren of parents with severe mental-health problems are particularly at risk to\ninherit them.\n        {\u00b6 163} Lawson has in fact had mental-health problems and has been\ndiagnosed with mental disorders since childhood. Most significantly, in March\n2011, shortly before he turned 17, Lawson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and\nbipolar disorder. In April of that year, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward at\nMercy Franciscan Hospital after a violent incident with his neighbor. Hospital staff\nmembers believed that past abuse had contributed to his emotional difficulties.\n        {\u00b6 164} Lawson continued to receive mental-health evaluations and\ntreatment in 2011 and 2012. During one psychiatric examination, he said he was\nhaving flashbacks to past abuse. In 2012, Lawson was hospitalized again because\nhe was contemplating injuring his neighbor.\n        {\u00b6 165} Since 2011, Lawson has been diagnosed repeatedly with depressive\ndisorder and PTSD. Dr. Stinson testified that when he interviewed Lawson, he\n\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nexhibited classic symptoms of depression and PTSD.                 Despite previous\nhospitalizations, Dr. Stinson testified, Lawson did not receive the kind of treatment\nhe needed.\n        {\u00b6 166} Lawson has had anger issues dating back to his childhood. During\nthe 2006 children\u2019s services investigation, the investigating social worker wrote\nthat she was concerned about Lawson\u2019s inability to control his anger. Dr. Stinson\ntestified that Lawson was enrolled in an anger-management class at age 13 because\nhe was unable to regulate his emotions; however, his stepmother removed him\nbecause the class took time away from his chores and homework. At age 16, he\nwas diagnosed with \u201canger disorder.\u201d Dr. Stinson noted that \u201cthere is no such thing\nas anger disorder,\u201d but he interpreted this diagnosis to mean that Lawson had a\nmood disorder in which anger was predominant.\n        {\u00b6 167} A consistent factor in Lawson\u2019s personality has been his repeatedly\nexpressed feelings that he was worthless; he described himself to Dr. Stinson as\nfeeling like \u201cjust a piece of crap\u201d and \u201clike a dog.\u201d Schoolmates made fun of his\nfamily and his first name. (His mother meant to name him \u201cAaron,\u201d but she\nmisspelled it as \u201cArron\u201d on his birth certificate. His preferred pronunciation is \u201cAr-\nron,\u201d with the emphasis on the second syllable, but people frequently mispronounce\nit.)   Bentley testified that Martha favored her own children over Lawson.\nAccording to Dr. Stinson, Lawson used marijuana to deal with feelings of\nemptiness and worthlessness.\n        {\u00b6 168} Lawson\u2019s family has an extensive history of drug and alcohol\nproblems. Lawson told Dr. Stinson that his father, Ray, was \u201cdrunk all the time.\u201d\nBentley testified that Ray drank \u201c[e]very day, all day long.\u201d Carolyn told Dr.\nStinson that Ray was \u201ca real bad drunk.\u201d During the period when Lawson lived\nwith Ray and Martha, Martha\u2019s brother Gary Munyon was released from prison and\nmoved into the household. Dr. Stinson testified that Munyon not only smoked\nmarijuana but traded it for sex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 169} Despite Lawson\u2019s family history, Dr. Stinson believed that Lawson\nhimself did not have \u201csevere drug and alcohol problems.\u201d But Dr. Stinson stated\nthat Lawson did use marijuana and other drugs to cope with physical pain and\nemotional distress. Bentley testified that Lawson smoked marijuana frequently or\ndaily. Dr. Stinson diagnosed Lawson with a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d but he\nconceded that this disorder caused no major impairment of Lawson\u2019s functioning.\nThere was no evidence that Lawson had been using alcohol or drugs at the time of\nthe aggravated murders in this case.\n       {\u00b6 170} Lawson had numerous medical problems throughout his life.\nWhen he was two, a dog bit him on the cheek, although Carolyn testified that the\ninjury was not serious. At the age of three, he had a laceration to the forehead,\nrequiring stitches, and had skin-cancer surgery. At the age of four, his tongue was\nclipped twice to correct a speech impediment. Both the skin-cancer surgery and\nthe tongue clipping were outpatient procedures. At the age of 12, while playing\nwith his siblings, he was shot in one eye with an \u201cairsoft\u201d gun (similar to a BB gun,\nbut firing plastic or rubber pellets), causing temporary blindness in that eye. Dr.\nStinson testified that Lawson has continued to have \u201cvision problems\u201d since that\ninjury. In addition, Lawson\u2019s gallbladder was removed in 2010.\n       {\u00b6 171} In 2011, Lawson suffered multiple medical problems. Severe\nheadaches required several doctor and hospital visits.        He also experienced\ndegenerative disc disease, abdominal pain, and \u201cabnormal findings related to his\ncolon and appendix.\u201d In 2017, Lawson was in a \u201cfender-bender\u201d accident and\nstruck his head on a rear-view mirror. While he did not seek medical attention at\nthe time, he experienced chronic headaches after the accident.\n       {\u00b6 172} In addition to the above factors, Lawson expressed remorse for the\nmurders in his confession and in his unsworn statement. He told the panel, \u201cI know\nwhat I did was wrong\u201d and stated that he was \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for what he did. He\napologized to everyone he had harmed, including the four murder victims and his\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nown family. He said that he cannot sleep at night, cries all the time, cries himself\nto sleep, and has flashbacks. He concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t expect sympathy. * * * If it\nbe death penalty, then I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m at peace with whatever you give me.\u201d\nLawson also expressed his remorse to Dr. Stinson, who felt that Lawson\u2019s remorse\nwas sincere.\n       {\u00b6 173} Dr. Stinson testified about Lawson\u2019s conduct in the Morrow\nCounty jail, where he was held pending trial. A jail supervisor described Lawson\nto Dr. Stinson as trustworthy, well behaved, respectful, and \u201cnot * * * a problem.\u201d\nOther correctional officers consistently told Dr. Stinson that Lawson was not\ncausing any problems.      Whenever Dr. Stinson saw Lawson interacting with\nofficers, they seemed to have a tension-free and professional relationship. On one\noccasion, Lawson gave jail staff members advance warning that several other\ninmates were planning to disrupt jail operations by flooding their toilets.\n       {\u00b6 174} Lawson\u2019s jail records showed two \u201cwrite-ups\u201d in the approximately\n16 months he was there. In January 2018, he got upset about a lockdown, kicked a\ndoor, and threatened an officer; he lost all privileges as a result. Dr. Stinson\ndescribed the other incident as \u201cequivocal.\u201d A Lawrence County deputy sheriff\nwho was transporting Lawson accused him of resisting him and of disrespect and\ndisobedience; however, a Morrow County deputy stated that there had been no\nproblem. Lawson was not disciplined for this incident. Overall, Dr. Stinson opined\nthat when compared to other inmates he had worked with, Lawson had adjusted to\nincarceration \u201crelatively\u201d well, even \u201cremarkably well.\u201d\n                   5. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n       {\u00b6 175} The trial court gleaned one mitigating factor from the\ncircumstances of the offense: while in the Holstons\u2019 house on the day of the\nmurders, Lawson fed two-year-old B.H., changed his diaper, and put him down for\na nap. Beyond that, nothing about the nature and circumstances of the offenses in\nthis case could be considered mitigating.\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\f                                   January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n                                     C. Weighing\n          {\u00b6 176} We must determine whether the aggravating circumstances that\nwere found by the three-judge panel outweigh the mitigating factors presented in\nthis case beyond a reasonable doubt.

See R.C.\n2929.04(B)(4). This court has frequently upheld death sentences for 23-year-old\nmurderers and has ordinarily given the (B)(4) factor little weight in those cases.\nSee, e.g., Conway, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">108 Ohio St.3d 214</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2006-Ohio-791</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">842 N.E.2d 996</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 195\n(\u201clittle weight\u201d); State v.

Graham had just turned 19 at\nthe time he committed aggravated murder, a little more than one year removed from\nthe minimum age for death-penalty eligibility. In contrast, Lawson was 23 when\nhe committed the murders at issue here, a more significant passage of time from\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe minimum age of eligibility. Therefore, we consider Lawson\u2019s youth to be a\nfactor that carries some weight.\n       {\u00b6 179} The evidence that Lawson was abused is not conclusive. The\nrecord does show, however, that Lawson experienced a degree of instability in his\nupbringing, with several changes in custody and living arrangements. The evidence\nalso shows that he was surrounded by poor role models and had few good role\nmodels and that he felt unloved and worthless.\n       {\u00b6 180} Because Lawson was 23 years old when he committed the four\naggravated murders in this case, he had at least some \u201ctime to distance himself from\nhis childhood and allow other factors to assert themselves in his personality and his\nbehavior,\u201d State v.

In this case,\nLawson did surrender\u2014although that decision may have been influenced by a cold\nnight in the woods without supplies, shelter, or weapons. More importantly,\nLawson gave a complete, truthful confession that aided the police with their crime-\nscene investigation. Therefore, we find that Lawson\u2019s remorse and cooperation are\nentitled to some weight in mitigation. His generally good conduct in jail is also\nentitled to some weight.\n       {\u00b6 183} With respect to D.H.\u2019s murder, the aggravating circumstances\ninclude that Lawson engaged in a course of conduct\u2014i.e., committed multiple\nmurders\u2014and the fact that D.H. was younger than 13. \u201cIn particular, the R.C.\n2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it\ninvolves the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d State v.

In addition, the murders of Stacey\u2019s parents have the escaping-\ndetection circumstance.\n       {\u00b6 185} Two recent cases in which we have found that aggravation did not\noutweigh mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, Johnson and Graham, each\ninvolved 19-year-old defendants, both of whom \u201centered a residence to commit\nrobbery and killed a [single] person inside.\u201d Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 Ohio St.3d 187</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2020-\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio-6700, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">172 N.E.3d 841</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 215. By contrast, Lawson was 23 years old; he\nentered the Holstons\u2019 residence and lay in wait specifically to kill; over a period of\n12 hours, he killed four people, one an eight-year-old child who should not even\nhave been in the house, and he attempted to kill a fifth.\n        {\u00b6 186} This case invites particular comparison with Graham, which it\nresembles in that both Lawson and Graham were young defendants who suffered\nfrom untreated or insufficiently treated mental-health issues and adverse\nenvironmental factors. See Graham at \u00b6 196. In fact, Lawson\u2019s mental disorders\u2014\nbipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, and anxiety\u2014are more significant than\nGraham\u2019s oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n        {\u00b6 187} However, this case is distinguishable from Graham in numerous\nimportant ways. We have already noted some of the key distinctions: Lawson was\nfour years older than Graham was when the crimes were committed; Lawson killed\nfour people to Graham\u2019s one; one of Lawson\u2019s victims was eight years old and that\ninnocent victim was in the house only because of Lawson\u2019s deception; Lawson\nentered the house where the crimes occurred with the express purpose of\ncommitting murder, unlike Graham, who entered for the purpose of robbery with\nno intention to kill anyone. And the list goes on.\n        {\u00b6 188} While Graham was the principal offender in the aggravated murder\nhe committed, he \u201cwas not the mastermind,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 Ohio St.3d 187</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4643945\"><a href=\"/opinion/4840166/state-v-graham-slip-opinion/\">2020-Ohio-6700</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">172 N.E.3d 841</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \u00b6 205, of the drug robbery that led to the murder; he was\nrecruited by a friend. In this case, Lawson was not just the principal offender; he\nwas the sole offender. Nobody recruited or enticed him; the whole thing was his\nidea.\n        {\u00b6 189} The murder in Graham was a quick reaction to events during the\nrobbery: Graham told the victim not to look at the robbers, the victim expressed\ndoubt that Graham would shoot him, and Graham shot him. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at \u00b6 12</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In contrast,\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nLawson planned and prepared for Stacey\u2019s murder well in advance and committed\nfour murders over a 12-hour period in which the death toll mounted.\n         {\u00b6 190} Like Lawson, Graham used marijuana daily. But unlike Lawson,\nGraham was also addicted to Xanax, using \u201cmassive\u201d daily amounts of it, Graham\nat \u00b6 199. Moreover, Graham\u2019s Xanax use made him more irritable and aggressive\nand less inhibited. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at \u00b6 199, 210</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Indeed, Graham\u2019s expert witness testified that\nit was unlikely that Graham would have committed the murder but for his Xanax\naddiction. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at \u00b6 199</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Lawson had a cannabis-use disorder, but according to Dr.\nStinson it caused no major impairment of his functioning, and there is no evidence\nthat drug use played any role in the murders in this case.\n         {\u00b6 191} This case is undeniably one in which the defendant has presented\nsignificant mitigating factors. But this is also a case in which the defendant\nslaughtered four people, including the callous slaying of an eight-year-old child.\nWith respect to each of the four aggravated murders before us, we find that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n                                D. Proportionality\n         {\u00b6 192} We further determine that the death sentences for these crimes are\nproportionate to sentences approved in similar cases.

Lawson\u2019s convictions. I reluctantly concur, however, with this\ncourt\u2019s judgment affirming Lawson\u2019s death sentence.\n       {\u00b6 195} Having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic-stress\ndisorder, and depression, there is no denying that Lawson suffers from serious\nmental illnesses and that he did not receive adequate treatment for these disorders.\nOf these diagnoses, bipolar disorder has been found to be a major mental illness.\nSee State v. Ketterer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">111 Ohio St.3d 70</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2006-Ohio-5283</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">855 N.E.2d 48</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 172,\n205. The majority opinion recognizes that Lawson\u2019s mental-health history was\nsubstantial and accorded it the mitigating factor entitled to the strongest weight.\nSee majority opinion at \u00b6 177. The General Assembly has also recognized the\ncritical importance of this issue, see 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, which became\neffective during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        54\n\f                                     January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 196} As of April 12, 2021, a person who has been diagnosed with a\n\u201cserious mental illness\u201d\u2014including bipolar disorder\u2014is ineligible for a death\nsentence, R.C. 2929.025(E)(1), when the defendant timely raises the issue and\nproves by a preponderance of the evidence, R.C. 2929.025(D)(1), that the illness\n\u201csignificantly impaired the person\u2019s capacity to exercise rational judgment,\u201d\n2929.025(A)(1)(b), with respect to either conforming to the law or appreciating the\nnature,     consequences,    or      wrongfulness         of   the   person\u2019s      conduct,\n2929.025(A)(1)(b)(i) and (ii). Because Lawson was sentenced before the effective\ndate of 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136, he has one year after its effective date to seek\na   postconviction     remedy,       R.C.    2953.21(A)(2)(b).         See      also   R.C.\n2953.21(A)(1)(a)(iv) and 2953.21(A)(3)(a), as amended. Notwithstanding our\njudgment today, the postconviction statutes leave a door open for Lawson.\n          O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n                                  _________________\n          BRUNNER, J., dissenting.\n          {\u00b6 197} Testing the competency of persons accused of capital crimes is\ncritical to affording the degree of due process guaranteed by the Ohio and federal\nConstitutions and fulfills the proscription found in the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution against cruel and unusual punishment.

In Ohio,\nthe General Assembly has recently prohibited the imposition of the death penalty\nfor the crime of aggravated murder when the defendant had a serious mental illness\nat the time that he committed the offense. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.02(A), 2929.025,\nand other statutes enacted in 2020 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 136. This case is therefore\nabout more than whether appellant, Arron Lawson, was able to consult with his\nlawyers and reasonably understand the proceedings against him. This appeal is an\nopportunity for this court to reexamine the protections and precautions that are\ncentral to ensuring that any death sentence that is imposed is appropriate and\nsubjected to a reliable, deliberate, and rigorous constitutional review.\n       {\u00b6 199} Former Justice Paul Pfeifer stated when he served as a justice of\nthis court that \u201c[t]he death penalty should be reserved for the most severe of cases.\u201d\nState v.

It is difficult to imagine Lawson\u2019s\nhorrendous acts not falling into the category of the worst of cases. But this court is\nconstitutionally bound to not only review Lawson\u2019s sentence but also to verify the\nintegrity of the process leading to the imposition of the death penalty as the\npunishment for his crimes. This should not be a mechanistic analysis; it should be\na thorough endeavor that closely examines all aspects of the proceedings that have\nculminated in our review. Because there are too many unaddressed concerns in the\nmajority\u2019s analysis, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n   I.

Likewise, after the conclusion of the trial-court proceedings, if a\nperson who was convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death wanted to forgo\nfurther legal challenges, essentially volunteering for death, this court has required\nthat the person undergo a competency evaluation and that the trial court hold a\nhearing before such a request would be honored.

However, clear guidelines are lacking about the way\ncompetency should be questioned and examined in the stages that occur between\nthe period before the start of a trial and the final imposition of a death sentence.\nThus, trial courts have been free to apply whatever standards they choose during\nthose stages, and their decisions are not overturned on appeal unless there are\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d in the record, State v.

Indicia of incompetency in Lawson\u2019s case\n       {\u00b6 202} Lawson has raised three areas of concern that, taken together,\nshould be held to have triggered the trial court\u2019s duty to order a pretrial\nincompetency exam: when Lawson acted against the advice of his counsel by\nwaiving a trial and entering guilty pleas, when Lawson exhibited indecisiveness\nabout his decision to enter guilty pleas, and when Lawson revealed to the court that\nhe was taking prescription medications. Going against the advice of counsel, alone,\ndoes not equate with incompetence. Indecisiveness, alone, may not necessarily\nconstitute a clear indicator that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Nor may\ntaking prescription medications, standing alone, be a clear indicator of\nincompetence. Our inquiry in this appeal, however, is not whether we believe that\nLawson was competent; it is whether these factors taken together should be held to\nreasonably indicate to a trial court that further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s\ncompetency is required, to ensure the fairness of the proceeding, especially in a\ncapital case. See R.C. 2945.37(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                      January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n         {\u00b6 203} There were indicia, i.e., signs or indications, that should have\nprompted\u2014and did prompt\u2014the trial court to further inquire about concerns of\npossible \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d regarding Lawson\u2019s competency to\nwaive a trial and change his pleas. On multiple occasions, the trial court raised the\nissue of a possible competency evaluation.1 The record is clear that the presiding\ntrial judge was hesitating and \u201csecond-guessing\u201d whether the types of\nconsiderations underlying Atkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\">536 U.S. 304</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\">122 S.Ct. 2242</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\">153 L.Ed.2d 335</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nand other precedents had been observed or applied. The trial judge appeared\nhesitant about Lawson\u2019s thought process in making the grave and weighty decision\nto plead guilty in a proceeding that could carry the consequential punishment of\ndeath.\n         {\u00b6 204} Lawson\u2019s actions in waiving his right to a jury trial and entering\npleas of guilty to multiple capital offenses, combined with the trial court\u2019s\nhesitations, were indicia of incompetency that do exist in our limited record,\nconsidering that no competency examination or hearing ever occurred. It should\nnot be our role to guess from the evidence what Lawson\u2019s state of mind was and\ntherefore what his mental capabilities were.                If he had been assessed for\ncompetency, we would be able to read a report from a mental-health professional\nabout his ability and state of mind. Without that kind of evidence, it is difficult to\ndiscern from the record whether Lawson was exercising the rights of a rational,\nmentally and physically healthy person in making this decision.

The majority opinion outlines the discussions between the trial judge and counsel regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency, including an in-chambers discussion on February 11, 2019.

Further discussion in\nthe record occurred on February 21, 2019, when the presiding trial judge asked counsel whether\nthey had any concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency\u201d and\ninquired as to counsel\u2019s investigation of those issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                               59\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ndefendant desires to \u201c \u2018abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility\nthat the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect\u2019 \u201d). That we\nwould guess or infer what a competency evaluation would have shown debases our\nunique role in reviewing death-penalty appeals.\n       {\u00b6 205} The record is clear that when the trial court during the plea colloquy\nasked Lawson whether his mental clarity was affected by any medications, Lawson\ndisclosed that he was taking several\u2014naproxen, Vistaril, metronidazole, and\nZoloft. The trial court questioned Lawson and defense counsel regarding these\nmedications and asked whether they could be affecting Lawson\u2019s ability to reason\nor his judgment. And while there is no affirmative indication in the record that\nLawson\u2019s medications did affect his ability to understand or reason, more inquiry\ncertainly was in order.

What medical\ndiagnoses and symptoms indicated that those medications should be prescribed?\nWas he experiencing or had he ever experienced any side effects from those\nmedications, including drowsiness, confusion, or suicidal thoughts? A competency\nexam could have provided answers to these questions to allay concerns regarding\nLawson\u2019s competency.

Using this\nmethod to make what amounts to a medical determination that a person charged\nwith a capital crime is or was competent is not only constitutionally flawed, it is\nunacceptable. This is particularly so when there is evidence that a defendant is\ntaking prescription medications that may affect his or her behavior or demeanor.2\nNo one asked Lawson whether drowsiness or confusion might be a side effect of\nany of his medications.           No one asked Lawson whether any of his current\nmedications were prescribed for impulse control. No one asked Lawson whether\nhe was depressed or suicidal. And no one asked him on the record why he was\nchoosing to plead guilty to capital offenses.\n         {\u00b6 207} Lawson\u2019s decision to waive a trial and enter pleas of guilty in this\ncapital case, combined with the trial court\u2019s apparent misgivings as they appear in\nthe record, support that further inquiry into Lawson\u2019s competency was necessary.\nI would thus reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment based on this issue and would\nremand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings regarding Lawson\u2019s\ncompetency.\n  C.

According to information available on the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website, drowsiness is a side effect\nof most of the medications Lawson was taking; confusion is a side effect of Vistaril and\nmetronidazole; and suicidal thoughts, loss of memory, hallucinations, and loss of contact with reality\nare side effects of Zoloft. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs (accessed July 9, 2021)\n[https://perma.cc/UL5E-XLDS].\n\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nraised, raised by motion, or raised with the intention of obtaining or ordering a\nhearing.

See fn. 1 of this\nopinion, supra. The majority interprets the record to indicate that the trial-court\njudge was merely asking the defense whether it wanted a competency hearing. But\nisn\u2019t it just as plausible that the trial judge was truly questioning whether there was\nenough information available to reach a sound conclusion that Lawson was\ncompetent to not only stand trial but to waive it?

Rather, the court\n\u201craised\u201d the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency for purposes of R.C. 2945.37(B).\n        {\u00b6 210} Nothing prohibits this court from reviewing the record and\ndetermining that the issue of competency was raised. Nothing prohibits us from\nremanding this case for a competency evaluation to be conducted and a competency\nhearing to be held; the result of that hearing would determine the course of events\nfrom that point. Such a hearing is required by statute, but one was not held. If we\ndo this, we would accomplish several important aims. We would acknowledge the\ngravity of any capital defendant\u2019s adverse-interest request to plead guilty to a\ncapital offense. We would also provide valuable guidance to this state\u2019s trial courts\nthat creating a sound record compliant with R.C. 2945.37(B) is required, especially\nwhen the defendant is making an adverse-interest decision, such as waiving a trial\nand pleading guilty to one or more capital offenses. Remanding this case for a\ncompetency hearing would be of benefit to the public in ensuring a high standard\nof compliance with due-process principles in cases in which a death sentence could\nbe imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 211} The issue of Lawson\u2019s competency was raised, requiring the trial\ncourt to hold a competency hearing.

We should require that this hearing be held.\n                 D. General problems with the current framework\n       {\u00b6 212} When a capital defendant seeks to abandon his or her rights and\nacquiesce in entering a guilty plea, essentially clearing the thorny thicket on the\npath toward execution by the state, we owe that defendant, the victims and their\nfamilies, the lower courts, and the public at large a standardized approach to ensure\nfairness and uniformity in trials of this gravamen. Viewing the record using the\n\u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d method falls short, because it is based on\ngleaning information from a record when often no record was made.\n       {\u00b6 213} It is not acceptable to simply rely on the observations of the trial\ncourt and/or the experiences and opinions of defense counsel that a criminal\ndefendant is competent to stand trial.

This conclusion was\n       bolstered by the opinion of Montgomery\u2019s attorney\u2014who was not a\n       medical expert\u2014that Montgomery understood the rights that he was\n       waiving. But if medication prevented Montgomery from truly\n       comprehending his actions, how reliable were his spoken assurances\n       and his signed statement to the contrary? The trial court did not\n       inquire about whether or how the medications affected\n       Montgomery\u2019s abilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n               I believe that more was required under Mink and Damon. At\n       the very least, when someone is undoubtedly under the influence of\n       a prescription medication when making the decision to enter a guilty\n       plea, the trial court must inquire about the effects of the medication\n       so that it can ensure that the defendant understands the gravity of the\n       situation and comprehends his or her actions. This court should not\n       affirm a conviction, let alone a death sentence, by guessing about\n       the mental competence of a defendant. Further inquiry was required\n       before the trial court accepted Montgomery\u2019s plea of guilty.\n\n\n(Emphasis sic.) State v.

Most attorneys and judges are not\npracticing mental-health or disability experts. Relying on a defense attorney\u2019s\nopinion, when that opinion is likely to be a one-off (based on how defense counsel\ninterprets the defendant\u2019s behavior at that particular juncture of the trial),\nanecdotally based opinion on the defendant\u2019s competency is neither a sound legal\nnor ethical practice.   Judging a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity to reason and\nunderstand through observed behavior by defense counsel and/or the court,\nespecially when coupled with a grave, adverse-interest decision such as pleading\nguilty to one or more capital offenses, denies due process when the defendant is\ntaking prescription medication with clinical indications and side effects that\nresearch shows may affect sound reasoning at the time the defendant changes his\nor her plea. And, finally, there is an inherent and systemic flaw that may not even\nbe recognized when we perpetuate reliance on judges\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 subjective\nassessments of a capital defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial or change a plea:\nperhaps we perpetuate predisposed ideas and stereotyped, culture- or race-based\nperceptions and predispositions about what is acceptable behavior during a trial.\nSee State v.

And we find today that no medical evaluation for\ncompetency is required when a defendant\u2019s experienced attorney\u2014by self-\nproclamation\u2014has adjudged his client to be competent based on counsel\u2019s stated\nability to recognize mental illness, even when that client may not outwardly\ndemonstrate visible symptoms of mental illness to nonclinical laypersons during\nthe limited time they interact with them.\n       {\u00b6 215} In short, the approach perpetuated in this case denies criminal\ndefendants accused of capital crimes the guarantee that the laws of this state will\nbe applied in a rigorously constitutional manner when the consequences may be\nirrevocable. We should not continue to rely on indicia in the record as sufficient to\ndetermine a defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty without requiring evidence\nbased on sound medical judgment. It is incumbent on this court to require in death-\npenalty cases what is now readily at our disposal\u2014the use of science in a\ncompetency evaluation so that the state puts to death only those whom we may\nfairly determine have knowingly and competently pleaded guilty. In doing this, we\nwould avoid what amounts to guessing who is competent based on \u201cindicia\u201d (that\nmay or may not make it into the record) in favor of science-based evidence that is\ninformed by evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n     E. The need for evidence-based practices and not just indicia in the record\n        {\u00b6 216} On February 21, 2019, when the trial court held a change-of-plea\nhearing for Lawson, the presiding judge asked defense counsel whether they had\nany concerns about Lawson\u2019s having any \u201cmental defect or mental deficiency.\u201d\nLead defense counsel first informed the court that he was not \u201ca psychologist or a\npsychiatrist\u201d and was not in a position to \u201ctechnically answer\u201d that question.\nDefense counsel then informed the trial court that Dr. Bob Stinson had been\nconsulted on the issue and that the defense did not intend to raise the issue of\nLawson\u2019s competency. At this point in the proceedings, there was nothing in the\nrecord about Lawson\u2019s being suicidal, having attempted suicide in the past, having\nexperienced (or at the time experiencing) confusion and possible hallucinations, or\ntaking several medications. The fact that those indicia were not yet in the record at\nthis point does not negate their existence. It does, however, demonstrate the\ninherent flaws in this court\u2019s current \u201csufficient indicia of incompetency\u201d test.\n        {\u00b6 217} Defense counsel, the prosecutors, and the trial court entertained the\npossibility of having Dr. Stinson render an opinion on Lawson\u2019s competency. Dr.\nStinson had been hired as a mental- and behavioral-health expert for the mitigation\nphase of the trial. He was not hired to perform a competency examination for the\npurpose of trial. However, had the trial court been able to conduct at least a review\nof his written report at this juncture of the proceedings, the following would have\nbecome apparent:\n1.      Lawson was raised in a dysfunctional family, suffered from poverty,\n        emotional abuse, and probably physical abuse, and was exposed to familial\n        incest;\n2.      Lawson\u2019s family members had a history of mental illness, including bipolar\n        disorder, depression, and suicidal behavior, and had a history of alcoholism\n        and drug abuse; Lawson\u2019s mother was rated as being \u201csignificantly\n        functionally impaired\u201d by her physician;\n\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n3.     Lawson had mental-health problems starting at least by age 13, when he\n       was enrolled in anger-management classes; he was diagnosed with bipolar\n       disorder in 2011; he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital on two\n       occasions following suicidal and homicidal episodes; he has been diagnosed\n       with depressive disorder and posttraumatic-stress disorder;\n4.     Since his psychiatric hospitalizations, he has been on a number of\n       medications, including mood stabilizers, antidepressant medicines,\n       antipsychotic drugs, and a medication to help with sleep and to control\n       impulses;\n5.     After his arrest, Lawson was seen by staff members at Shawnee Mental\n       Health, where he disclosed that he had attempted to hang himself several\n       years before and reported that he had been having thoughts of suicide;\n6.     After his arrest, Lawson was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and\n       reported to Dr. Stinson that he was having trouble sleeping and\n       concentrating and was occasionally having auditory and visual\n       hallucinations.\n       {\u00b6 218} This information about Lawson was not discussed at all at this point\nin the proceedings even though it is discussed in this court\u2019s majority opinion. The\nArron Lawson identified and described in Dr. Stinson\u2019s report is a person impaired\nby mental illness who has a stated history of being suicidal. The trial court was not\npresented with this information until the mitigation phase of the proceeding, and\nthis is precisely an example of the problem with the test this court adopted in the\npast and once again applies in Lawson\u2019s case. Had the trial court simply ordered a\ncompetency examination, as was discussed at several junctures during the trial\nphase, the issue of Lawson\u2019s competency to stand trial would have been made clear\nin the record beyond the mere presence of vague indicia that the record now\ncontains.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n          {\u00b6 219} Putting someone to death for his or her crimes, even when the\ncrimes are heinous and when it is apparent that the person on trial is the person who\ncommitted the crimes, is always subject to the constitutional due-process principles\ncontained in the Bill of Rights, a document once demanded by, and its contents now\nguaranteed to, the people. Due-process principles are not satisfied by guessing or\nby the acknowledged inexactitude of gleaning indicia from a sketchy trial record.\nThe determination of Lawson\u2019s competency should be based on evidence. That the\nquestion of his competency was \u201craised\u201d was enough to require the trial court to\norder a competency evaluation and a hearing on the matter under R.C. 2945.37(B),\nno matter what his attorney said to the court.

This\ncourt should be requiring that evidence-based practices be the standard for\ncompetency evidence used by the courts of this state for what are essentially clinical\nconclusions regarding defendants\u2019 competency to stand trial. Once we do this, we\nwill have taken a giant stride to ensure that due-process principles are adhered to in\nthe prosecutions of persons accused of crimes, especially those accused of\ncommitting capital crimes.\n     F. Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest request\n       {\u00b6 221} When reading the fact pattern of violence and often torture that\noccurs in nearly every death-penalty case, the reader is left to conjecture: Who in\ntheir right mind could do such a thing? Since that perception is present from the\nbeginning, and since an adverse-interest request such as agreeing to plead guilty to\na capital offense as charged could be viewed as irrational and against the\ndefendant\u2019s self-interests, it would be best for courts to start from a presumption\nthat competency is at issue whenever a defendant makes an adverse-interest\nrequest. Starting with this presumption and questioning competency in this way\nwould mean that a trial court\u2019s compliance with R.C. 2945.37(B) would be ensured.\nThe trial court would then be required to conduct further inquiry, thus creating a\nrecord and instilling a more reliable, constitutional approach.\n       {\u00b6 222} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest alleviates the necessity for a court to inquire as to defense counsel\u2019s position\non the subject. The judiciary must dismiss the temptation to put defense attorneys\nin the position of assessing their clients\u2019 capabilities, which goes beyond the\nattorneys\u2019 expertise and their ethical duties. We also should steer courts away from\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f                                  January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\nlooking for subjectively bizarre behavior and encourage them to simply obtain\ninformation from a clinical expert using evidence-based practices.\n       {\u00b6 223} Questioning competency at the instance of an adverse-interest\nrequest also triggers the building of a record. A competency examination and a\nhearing would be the most comprehensive way to ensure a complete and thorough\nrecord. The trial court should make a finding one way or the other based on\nevidence in the record regarding the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand\nchoices and assist in his or her own defense. This includes determining whether\nthe defendant possesses the ability to comprehend the ramifications of his or her\ndecision, including understanding that the choice may lead to death, determining\nwhether the defendant is able to make such a decision knowingly and intelligently,\nnot unduly affected by conditions of mental health, physical health, or\nimprisonment, and determining whether the defendant possesses the ability to\nreason logically and fully understands the ramifications of his decision.

Mink, in which the defendant was charged\nwith aggravated murder for the horrendous stabbings and beatings of his parents,\nthe trial court sua sponte appointed two psychologists to conduct separate\ncompetency examinations when Mink first informed the court that he wished to\nenter pleas of guilty to all counts, to waive the presentation of mitigating evidence,\nand to represent himself. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">101 Ohio St.3d 350</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2004-Ohio-1580</span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">805 N.E.2d 1064</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat \u00b6 31, 59-60.

For example, a clinical\nexamination might not be required when a defendant wishes to waive representation\nby counsel. When making a decision like that, the defendant still has procedural\nand substantive protections in place. Courts should seek to examine a defendant\u2019s\ncompetency in view of the context and purpose of the proceeding. Therefore,\ncompetency evaluations should be specifically tailored to address the capacity and\nthe ability of the defendant to understand the ramifications of the specific adverse-\ninterest request he or she is making.

Martin and\n        Dr. Kim Stookey, the Court finds that the Defendant:\n                 1.) Understands the choice between life and death,\n                 2.) Has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to\n                 pursue the presentation of evidence,\n                 3.)

Understands his right to present mitigating evidence,\n                 6.) Understands the meaning of mitigating evidence,\n                 7.)

Understands the effect of failing to present mitigating evidence.\n                 The Court further finds that the Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the\n        presentation of mitigating evidence is made knowingly, intelligently and\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    January Term, 2021\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 226} Additionally, requiring that a record be developed when a\ndefendant invokes an adverse-interest request ensures balance in the system. If\nLawson had been asked further questions, his suicidal ideation and suicide attempt\nmay have become known to the court, as counsel presumably were aware of those\nmatters. At that point, any court would certainly have sought further information\nabout the defendant\u2019s mental health and capabilities before allowing the trial to\nproceed for the state to seek his execution.

The claim, which initially was established for work-related injuries to claimant's jaw, neck, back and right shoulder, subsequently was amended to include posttraumatic stress disorder. Throughout the pendency of this claim, claimant was evaluated by and received medical care from his treating physician, Seth Schran, and underwent various independent medical examinations, including examinations performed by Paul Kleinman.</p>\r\n<p>At a March 2019 hearing, claimant sought to be classified with a permanent total disability and also raised the issue of a traumatic brain injury. The Workers' Compensation Law Judge (hereinafter WCLJ) found prima facie evidence of a traumatic brain injury, directed the employer's workers' compensation carrier to obtain an independent medical examination with respect thereto and held the issue of permanency in abeyance. Although the examiner in question concluded that claimant had reached maximum medical improvement, he did not directly address the traumatic brain injury alleged. The WCLJ amended the claim to include a traumatic brain injury but noted that, even discounting such injury, the reports tendered by Schran and Kleinman established that claimant was permanently totally disabled. The employer and its workers' compensation carrier (hereinafter collectively referred to as the carrier) sought administrative review \u2014 as well as to reopen the hearing \u2014 contending, among other things, that the medical evidence did not support the classification made by the WCLJ and that it was denied the right to cross-examine Schran as to his conclusions. By decision filed June 16, 2020, the Workers' Compensation Board, among other things, affirmed the WCLJ's finding of a permanent total disability, concluding, as relevant here, that there was \"no meaningful distinction\" between the medical opinions rendered by Schran and Kleinman and, therefore, the carrier's request for cross-examination was properly denied. The carrier's request for reconsideration and/or full Board review subsequently was denied, and this appeal from the Board's June 2020 decision followed.</p>\r\n<p>\"To establish a total disability, a claimant must demonstrate that he or she is totally disabled and unable to engage in any gainful employment\" (<i>Matter of Wolfe v Ames Dept. Store, Inc.</i>, 159 AD3d 1291, 1292 [2018] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; <i>accord Matter of Torres v St. Luke's Roosevelt Hosp.</i>, 165 AD3d 1355, 1357 [2018], <i>lv denied</i> 32 NY3d 916 [2019]; <i>see</i> Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [1]; <i>see generally Matter of Burgos v Citywide Cent. [*2]Ins. Program</i>, 148 AD3d 1493, 1495 [2017], <i>affd</i> 30 NY3d 990 [2017]), i.e., \"there is no expectation that he or she will rejoin the work force\" (<i>Matter of Torres v St. Luke's Roosevelt Hosp.</i>, 165 AD3d at 1357 n [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). The Board is vested with the discretion to evaluate the medical opinions proffered and is free to accept or reject portions thereof (<i>see Matter of Gilliam v DOCCS Wende Corr. Facility</i>, 190 AD3d 1080, 1081 [2021]; <i>Matter of Nasir v BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc.</i>, 189 AD3d 1951, 1953 [2020]).</p>\r\n<p>In concluding that claimant was permanently totally disabled, the Board relied upon the report prepared by Schran following his January 2019 permanency evaluation of claimant, as well as the report authored by Kleinman following his independent medical examination of claimant in February 2019. According to Schran, claimant had reached maximum medical improvement and suffered a permanent impairment of his mandible, cervical and lumbar spines and right shoulder and wrist, in addition to sustaining psychiatric injuries and a brain concussion. Specifically, Schran found that claimant had a 29% schedule loss of use of his right shoulder and a 25% schedule loss of use of his mandible/jaw; as to claimant's cervical spine, lumbar spine and brain, Schran assessed class 4 severity rankings of D, F and L, respectively, to those permanent injuries. With respect to claimant's functional capabilities, Schran opined that claimant could never engage in lifting, carrying, pulling, pushing, climbing, kneeling, bending, stooping or squatting, nor could he drive a vehicle or operate machinery. Although Schran indicated that claimant occasionally could, among other things, walk, sit, stand and/or grasp simple objects, he ultimately concluded that claimant could not engage in any work activities \u2014 with or without restrictions.</p>\r\n<p>Kleinman agreed that claimant had reached maximum medical improvement, finding that claimant had sustained permanent injuries to his neck, back and right shoulder. More particularly, Kleinman opined that claimant had sustained a 20% schedule loss of use of his right shoulder and, as to claimant's cervical and lumbar spines, assigned class 4 severity rankings of E and F, respectively, to those injuries. Although Kleinman was of the view that claimant was \"capable of less than sedentary work,\" he agreed with Schran that claimant \"should not lift, carry, push[] or pull anything\" and \"should never do climbing, kneeling, bending, stooping[] or squatting.\" Kleinman similarly agreed that, although claimant \"could occasionally sit, occasionally stand[] and occasionally walk,\" as well as \"occasionally do simple grasping,\" he \"should not drive a vehicle [or] operate machinery.\"</p>\r\n<p>Upon reviewing Schran's and Kleinman's respective reports, the Board found \"no meaningful distinction\" between the subject opinions and concluded that \"[t]he significant permanent restrictions found by both doctors support[ed] a finding [*3]that</p>\r\n<p>. . . claimant [was] incapable of gainful employment.\" The carrier faults the Board's assessment in this regard, citing Kleinman's opinion that claimant was capable of performing less than sedentary work and contending, among other things, that the medical evidence failed to establish that claimant sustained a totally disabling brain injury. The carrier's argument, however, overlooks two important points.</p>\r\n<p>With respect to the issue of claimant's brain injury, the transcript underlying the WCLJ's decision makes clear that claimant was found to be permanently totally disabled even without considering the impact of his brain injury, and a review of the Board's decision reveals that it reached a similar conclusion. To be sure, the Board referenced Schran's findings relative to claimant's brain injury and credited his opinion as to claimant's overall disability because Schran \"evaluated all sites of injury.\" However, the Board also set forth \u2014 in detail \u2014 Schran's and Kleinman's respective findings as to claimant's other disabling injuries and, based upon the \"convergence of opinions\" as to claimant's \"significant permanent restrictions\" and limited capabilities, the Board concluded that both expert opinions supported a finding that claimant was incapable of gainful employment.</p>\r\n<p>As for the carrier's reliance upon Kleinman's opinion that claimant was capable of performing less than sedentary work, such reliance is misplaced given that Kleinman's actual assessment of claimant's capabilities mirrored the conclusions reached by Schran \u2014 namely, that claimant \"should not lift, carry, push[] or pull anything,\" \"should never do climbing, kneeling, bending, stooping[] or squatting\" and \"should not drive a vehicle [or] operate machinery.\" Stated differently, and as the Board aptly observed, \"given the consensus on . . . claimant's physical limitations,\" the distinction drawn by Kleinman \u2014 that claimant was capable of less than sedentary work \u2014 is \"of no evidentiary value.\" As the Board's finding that claimant is permanently totally disabled is supported by substantial evidence, it will not be disturbed (<i>see e.g. Matter of Malerba v Ameron Global, Inc.</i>, 117 AD3d 1302, 1303 [2014]; <i>Matter of Caezza v Via Health</i>, 111 AD3d 1033, 1034 [2013]; <i>Matter of Eaton v Dellapenna Assoc.</i>, 91 AD3d 1008, 1009 [2012]).</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we agree with the Board that there is no meaningful distinction between the expert opinions rendered and, therefore, we cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in denying the carrier's request to cross-examine Schran as to his conclusions (<i>cf.

The Judgment was entered following a\njury trial where Tartamella was convicted of all four counts as\ncharged: Assault in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii\nRevised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-711(1)(e) in Count 1; two counts of\nHarassment in violation of HRS \u00a7 711-1106(1)(b) and/or (f) in\nCounts 2 and 3; and Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree\nin violation of HRS \u00a7 707-716(1)(c) in Count 4. The State\nrequested restitution for the victim, Arnold Martinez (Martinez),\nfor losses caused by Tartamella, and the Circuit Court awarded\n$462.50 in restitution. This restitution award, for half of the\ncost of service dog training for Martinez's dog, is at issue in\nboth the appeal and cross-appeal.\n\n\n\n     1      The Honorable Fa#auuga L. To#oto#o presided.\n\f   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\n          On appeal, the State contends that the Circuit Court\nabused its discretion when it awarded only half of the amount of\nrequested restitution for the cost of the service dog training.\nOn cross-appeal, Tartamella contends that the Circuit Court erred\nwhen it ordered restitution for the dog training because the dog\ntraining costs were neither reasonable nor verified.\n          Upon careful review of the record and the briefs\nsubmitted by the parties and having given due consideration to\nthe arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we\nresolve the State's and Tartamella's points of error as follows,\nand affirm.\n          Following the trial and guilty verdict, a presentence\nreport that included letters from Martinez's doctors and\ntherapists, receipts, and other documentation related to the\nvictim restitution request was filed with the Circuit Court. The\npresentence report contained a letter from Dr. Ming B. Chi that\nconfirmed Martinez had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\ncaused by the assault, a letter from therapist Karen Kimball\n(Kimball) that verified a service dog was part of Martinez's\ntherapy plan, and an invoice from Off Leash K9 Training, LLC for\n$625.00.\n          The Circuit Court held a restitution hearing on October\n2, 2019. The State submitted its Memorandum of Law Supporting\nRequested Restitution of $882.222 to Complainant Arnold Martinez.\nThe amount included $625.00 to train Martinez's dog and $150 in\nmedical bills. At the hearing, Senior Probation Officer Keiko\nWest (West) testified regarding the presentence report she wrote\nand the request for restitution.               West's job was to write\npresentence reports to assist the              trial court for sentencing, and\nshe had also received training on              how to apply the restitution\nstatute. West testified that the               letters Martinez submitted from\n\n\n       2      This $882.22 amount included medical visits, counseling, medical service\ndog training, and future expenses; specifically $150.00 for ten medical visits, $17.22\nfor medication, $625.00 for medical service dog training, and $90.00 for estimated\nfuture expenses. We note that the transcript of the restitution hearing indicates\n\"State's Exhibit 1\" was received into evidence at the hearing, but the exhibit is not in\nthe record on appeal nor in the record below. However, West testified that State's\nExhibit 1 was \"part of my original pre-sentence report[,]\" and was a \"fair and accurate\ncopy of Exhibit C\" attached to the presentence report. \"Attachment C\" to the April 30,\n2019 presentence report consists of Martinez's \"Victim Impact Information\" and includes\nthe itemized expenses detailed above.\n\n                                           2\n\f   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\nhis therapist \"specifically said that he needed the mental health\ntreatment to deal with the trauma from the incident[,]\" and West\nfound the medical bills and therapy expenses were reasonable and\nverified as they \"fit within the time period of the incident, and\nthey were on Kaiser letterhead[.]\" West concluded that the\nmedical service dog training expense was reasonable and verified\nbased on the letter submitted by Martinez's therapist Kimball,\nand West had also called Kimball \"to verify that she indeed wrote\na letter, and she required that as part of [Martinez's] therapy.\"\nTartamella did not call any witnesses or produce any evidence at\nthe hearing.\n          At the conclusion of the restitution hearing, the\nCircuit Court reduced the amount of restitution for the dog\ntraining by half, from $625.00 to $312.50 because the dog was\nMartinez's \"personal dog,\" and ordered a total of $462.503 in\nrestitution as a free-standing order.\n          Both the State and Tartamella timely appealed. We\nfirst address Tartamella's cross-appeal, followed by the State's\nappeal.\n          Tartamella's Cross-Appeal\n           Tartamella contends in his cross-appeal that the\nCircuit Court abused its discretion by ordering $312.50 in\nrestitution for the cost of dog training for Martinez's pet dog.\nThe crux of Tartamella's argument is that the State failed to\nadduce evidence that Martinez's pet dog received specialized\nmedical service dog training, and the State failed to show the\ncost was reasonable and verified \"as medical service dog\ntraining.\" Tartamella claims that the dog training \"amounted to\nan obedience class and Martinez's pet dog was not certified as a\nmedical service dog.\"\n           Tartamella waived this argument because he did not\nraise it during the restitution hearing. See State v. Moses, 102\nHawai#i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) (\"As a general rule, if\na party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will\nbe deemed to have been waived on appeal . . . .\"); State v.\n\n\n       3      The $462.50 amount included $150.00 for medical visits and $312.50 for half\nof the $625.00 total cost for the medical service dog training.\n\n                                           3\n\f  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\nHoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990)\n(\"Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the trial\nlevel precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal.\")\n(citation omitted). During the hearing, Tartamella's sole\nargument was that his conduct did not cause Martinez's PTSD, and\nattacking the credibility of Martinez's claim that he had PTSD:\n\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, as the Court is well aware\n          based upon what's contained in the presentence report, as\n          well as the evidence presented at trial, Mr. Martinez,\n          according to him, suffered a -- a bruise on his left arm as\n          a result of being slapped by Mr. Tartamella, that -- that's\n          it. From that incident, he is -- he's -- he's claiming that\n          he now suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder.\n                Mr. Martinez was a football player, has been a coach\n          for many, many years, I'm sure has witnessed injuries much\n          worse than this to himself and to his players, and yet did\n          not suffer posttraumatic stress from those incidents. But\n          according to Mr. Martinez, because of this incident, he's\n          now suffering from posttraumatic stress, which caused him,\n          according to Mr. Martinez, to require counseling, medication\n          and this support animal.\n                If you look at attachment C to the [presentence\n          report], which is his victim impact statement, he says as a\n          result of this incident, my doctor advised I researched and\n          considered PTSD service animal training for my dog. This --\n          this was his family pet he had brought to practice many,\n          many times, everybody had seen it. He says my dog went\n          through extensive professional training. Part of his\n          training was advanced obedience training, an AKC advanced\n          behavior and obedience certification. This portion of\n          training and the AKC certification process cost $625.\n                From the defense -- from the defense standpoint, Your\n          Honor, one, it -- it is -- it is questionable whether Mr.\n          Martinez actually suffered posttraumatic stress disorder as\n          a result of this particular incident. . . .\n                THE COURT:   But there's no ques--\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:   They're not directly related \u2013-\n                THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], there's no question the\n          way -- I mean, the -- based on the facts of this case, the\n          way -- the behavior of your client -- of your client here\n          and everything, I mean, everybody has their -- has different\n          ways of re-- dealing with this kind of attack, verbal attack\n          that your client heaped on Mr. -- Mr. Martinez here. So he\n          needed the -- it was a stressful situation. To some extent,\n          yes, he did. Mr. Martinez suffer -- suffers anxiety and so\n          forth here.\n[JTr. dkt. 20 at 22-24.] (Emphases added). Tartamella questioned\nwhether Martinez \"actually suffered\" PTSD \"as a result\" of\nTartamella's conduct in this case, and whether the PTSD and the\nTartamella's conduct were \"directly related.\" Tartamella's\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\ncross-examination of West focused on causation,4 inquiring\nwhether West investigated if Martinez's claimed PTSD injury was\nfrom Tartamella's conduct, or whether it could have been from\nsome other factor. Tartamella's argument that the CGC5 training\nwas not specialized dog training, and thus not reasonable or\nverified, was never raised in the Circuit Court below, and is\nwaived. See Moses, 102 Hawai#i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947; Hoglund,\n71 Haw. at 150, 785 P.2d at 1313.\n\n             State's Appeal\n          The State contends that the Circuit Court abused its\ndiscretion by reducing the restitution for the dog training, and\nnot ordering Tartamella to pay the full cost of the training.\nTartamella argues that the State waived this argument on appeal\nbecause it failed to preserve the issue during the restitution\nhearing. We conclude that the State's contention is waived.\n          \"The general rule prohibiting new arguments on appeal\nprevents appellants from presenting new legal theories as to why\nthey should have prevailed at trial.\" Moses, 102 Hawai#i at 456,\n77 P.3d at 947. Arguments not raised below are generally deemed\nto have been waived on appeal. Hoglund, 71 Haw. at 150, 785 P.2d\nat 1313. When the Circuit Court reduced the State's requested\nrestitution in half, the State did not object:\n\n                   THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], there's no question the\n             way -- I mean, the -- based on the facts of this case, the\n             way -- the behavior of your client -- of your client here\n             and everything, I mean, everybody has their -- has different\n\n\n\n      4             Defense counsel questioned West regarding other possible causes for\nMartinez's PTSD:\n                    Q. (By [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) Okay. Ms. West, at the time --\n             at -- at the time of the complaint of injury, were you aware that\n             Mr. Martinez was under stress from a number of different causes,\n             including complaints that parents had made against him, his\n             inability to fill the football team, not knowing whether he was\n             going to have -- have a team to enter into the OIA that year \u2013-\n             . . . .\n                    Q. (By [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) Ms. West, were you aware\n             of any of the circumstances or any of the background of Mr.\n             Martinez that would give you some way of assessing whether\n             this particular injury would've been traumatic to him?\n\n       5      \"CGC\" refers to Canine Good Citizen training, which Tartamella raises for\nthe first time in his Answering Brief to the State's appeal, referencing Appendix F, a\nwebpage on the American Kennel Club's website. Defense counsel at the restitution\nhearing did not mention CGC or refer the Circuit Court to this website.\n\n                                           5\n\f  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n          ways of re-- dealing with this kind of attack, verbal attack\n          that your client heaped on Mr. -- Mr. Martinez here. So he\n          needed the -- it was a stressful situation. To some extent,\n          yes, he did. Mr. Martinez suffer -- suffers anxiety and so\n          forth here.\n                The only question is what is reasonable here, the --\n          the 220 -- the 625, the -- the 150, there's no question the\n          Court agrees with that. The 625, based on the fact that\n          part of this is that the dog is -- that is -- based on the\n          information here is -- is Mr. Martinez's personal dog, but\n          he -- nevertheless the dog went through training. So the\n          625, Ms. Prosecutor, half of that, what is half, half of\n          625? Get your -- get your phone, do the calculation.\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:    It's 312.50.\n                THE COURT:   Okay.   312.50 plus 150, . . . that's the\n          Court's order.\n                [PROSECUTOR]: Will the Court -- just for the record,\n          will the Court indicate why it's determining that half the\n          amount is appropriate and not the full amount that is --\n                THE COURT: Just part -- as the Court just pointed\n          out, part of this is that the dog involved here is the -- as\n          the dog involved here is Mr. Martinez's personal dog, all\n          right. And -- okay. That's the concern of the Court here,\n          using your own personal dog as opposed to a profession-- a\n          professional dog, nothing associated with Mr. Martinez,\n          that's the concern the Court has over here, so that's why\n          the Court is halving the 625. So that's the Court order.\n          That's the amount of restitution for this order. . . .\n(Emphases added). The record reflects that the State requested\nclarification as to why the Court reduced the amount of\nrestitution, but the State did not object to the halved amount\nnor argue why it was improper for the Circuit Court to reduce the\namount; and thus, the State's contention of error was waived.\nSee Moses, 102 Hawai#i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947; Hoglund, 71 Haw.\nat 150, 785 P.2d at 1313.\n          Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended\nJudgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence filed on October 3,\n2019, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.\n          DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, October 5, 2021.\nOn the briefs:\n                                    /s/ Katherine G.

We\nfirst address Tartamella's cross-appeal, followed by the State's\nappeal.\n          Tartamella's Cross-Appeal\n           Tartamella contends in his cross-appeal that the\nCircuit Court abused its discretion by ordering $312.50 in\nrestitution for the cost of dog training for Martinez's pet dog.\nThe crux of Tartamella's argument is that the State failed to\nadduce evidence that Martinez's pet dog received specialized\nmedical service dog training, and the State failed to show the\ncost was reasonable and verified \"as medical service dog\ntraining.\" Tartamella claims that the dog training \"amounted to\nan obedience class and Martinez's pet dog was not certified as a\nmedical service dog.\"\n           Tartamella waived this argument because he did not\nraise it during the restitution hearing.

During the hearing, Tartamella's sole\nargument was that his conduct did not cause Martinez's PTSD, and\nattacking the credibility of Martinez's claim that he had PTSD:\n\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, as the Court is well aware\n          based upon what's contained in the presentence report, as\n          well as the evidence presented at trial, Mr. Martinez,\n          according to him, suffered a -- a bruise on his left arm as\n          a result of being slapped by Mr. Tartamella, that -- that's\n          it. From that incident, he is -- he's -- he's claiming that\n          he now suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder.\n                Mr. Martinez was a football player, has been a coach\n          for many, many years, I'm sure has witnessed injuries much\n          worse than this to himself and to his players, and yet did\n          not suffer posttraumatic stress from those incidents. But\n          according to Mr. Martinez, because of this incident, he's\n          now suffering from posttraumatic stress, which caused him,\n          according to Mr. Martinez, to require counseling, medication\n          and this support animal.\n                If you look at attachment C to the [presentence\n          report], which is his victim impact statement, he says as a\n          result of this incident, my doctor advised I researched and\n          considered PTSD service animal training for my dog. This --\n          this was his family pet he had brought to practice many,\n          many times, everybody had seen it. He says my dog went\n          through extensive professional training. Part of his\n          training was advanced obedience training, an AKC advanced\n          behavior and obedience certification. This portion of\n          training and the AKC certification process cost $625.\n                From the defense -- from the defense standpoint, Your\n          Honor, one, it -- it is -- it is questionable whether Mr.\n          Martinez actually suffered posttraumatic stress disorder as\n          a result of this particular incident. . . .\n                THE COURT:   But there's no ques--\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:   They're not directly related \u2013-\n                THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], there's no question the\n          way -- I mean, the -- based on the facts of this case, the\n          way -- the behavior of your client -- of your client here\n          and everything, I mean, everybody has their -- has different\n          ways of re-- dealing with this kind of attack, verbal attack\n          that your client heaped on Mr. -- Mr. Martinez here. So he\n          needed the -- it was a stressful situation. To some extent,\n          yes, he did. Mr. Martinez suffer -- suffers anxiety and so\n          forth here.\n[JTr. dkt. 20 at 22-24.] (Emphases added). Tartamella questioned\nwhether Martinez \"actually suffered\" PTSD \"as a result\" of\nTartamella's conduct in this case, and whether the PTSD and the\nTartamella's conduct were \"directly related.\" Tartamella's\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n\ncross-examination of West focused on causation,4 inquiring\nwhether West investigated if Martinez's claimed PTSD injury was\nfrom Tartamella's conduct, or whether it could have been from\nsome other factor. Tartamella's argument that the CGC5 training\nwas not specialized dog training, and thus not reasonable or\nverified, was never raised in the Circuit Court below, and is\nwaived. See Moses, 102 Hawai#i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947; Hoglund,\n71 Haw. at 150, 785 P.2d at 1313.\n\n             State's Appeal\n          The State contends that the Circuit Court abused its\ndiscretion by reducing the restitution for the dog training, and\nnot ordering Tartamella to pay the full cost of the training.\nTartamella argues that the State waived this argument on appeal\nbecause it failed to preserve the issue during the restitution\nhearing. We conclude that the State's contention is waived.\n          \"The general rule prohibiting new arguments on appeal\nprevents appellants from presenting new legal theories as to why\nthey should have prevailed at trial.\" Moses, 102 Hawai#i at 456,\n77 P.3d at 947. Arguments not raised below are generally deemed\nto have been waived on appeal. Hoglund, 71 Haw. at 150, 785 P.2d\nat 1313. When the Circuit Court reduced the State's requested\nrestitution in half, the State did not object:\n\n                   THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], there's no question the\n             way -- I mean, the -- based on the facts of this case, the\n             way -- the behavior of your client -- of your client here\n             and everything, I mean, everybody has their -- has different\n\n\n\n      4             Defense counsel questioned West regarding other possible causes for\nMartinez's PTSD:\n                    Q. (By [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) Okay. Ms. West, at the time --\n             at -- at the time of the complaint of injury, were you aware that\n             Mr. Martinez was under stress from a number of different causes,\n             including complaints that parents had made against him, his\n             inability to fill the football team, not knowing whether he was\n             going to have -- have a team to enter into the OIA that year \u2013-\n             . . . .\n                    Q. (By [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) Ms. West, were you aware\n             of any of the circumstances or any of the background of Mr.\n             Martinez that would give you some way of assessing whether\n             this particular injury would've been traumatic to him?\n\n       5      \"CGC\" refers to Canine Good Citizen training, which Tartamella raises for\nthe first time in his Answering Brief to the State's appeal, referencing Appendix F, a\nwebpage on the American Kennel Club's website. Defense counsel at the restitution\nhearing did not mention CGC or refer the Circuit Court to this website.\n\n                                           5\n\f  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER\n          ways of re-- dealing with this kind of attack, verbal attack\n          that your client heaped on Mr. -- Mr. Martinez here. So he\n          needed the -- it was a stressful situation. To some extent,\n          yes, he did. Mr. Martinez suffer -- suffers anxiety and so\n          forth here.\n                The only question is what is reasonable here, the --\n          the 220 -- the 625, the -- the 150, there's no question the\n          Court agrees with that. The 625, based on the fact that\n          part of this is that the dog is -- that is -- based on the\n          information here is -- is Mr. Martinez's personal dog, but\n          he -- nevertheless the dog went through training. So the\n          625, Ms. Prosecutor, half of that, what is half, half of\n          625? Get your -- get your phone, do the calculation.\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:    It's 312.50.\n                THE COURT:   Okay.   312.50 plus 150, . . . that's the\n          Court's order.\n                [PROSECUTOR]: Will the Court -- just for the record,\n          will the Court indicate why it's determining that half the\n          amount is appropriate and not the full amount that is --\n                THE COURT: Just part -- as the Court just pointed\n          out, part of this is that the dog involved here is the -- as\n          the dog involved here is Mr. Martinez's personal dog, all\n          right. And -- okay. That's the concern of the Court here,\n          using your own personal dog as opposed to a profession-- a\n          professional dog, nothing associated with Mr. Martinez,\n          that's the concern the Court has over here, so that's why\n          the Court is halving the 625. So that's the Court order.\n          That's the amount of restitution for this order. . . .\n(Emphases added). The record reflects that the State requested\nclarification as to why the Court reduced the amount of\nrestitution, but the State did not object to the halved amount\nnor argue why it was improper for the Circuit Court to reduce the\namount; and thus, the State's contention of error was waived.\nSee Moses, 102 Hawai#i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947; Hoglund, 71 Haw.\nat 150, 785 P.2d at 1313.\n          Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended\nJudgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence filed on October 3,\n2019, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.\n          DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, October 5, 2021.\nOn the briefs:\n                                    /s/ Katherine G.

But\n          according to Mr. Martinez, because of this incident, he's\n          now suffering from posttraumatic stress, which caused him,\n          according to Mr. Martinez, to require counseling, medication\n          and this support animal.\n                If you look at attachment C to the [presentence\n          report], which is his victim impact statement, he says as a\n          result of this incident, my doctor advised I researched and\n          considered PTSD service animal training for my dog. This --\n          this was his family pet he had brought to practice many,\n          many times, everybody had seen it. He says my dog went\n          through extensive professional training. Part of his\n          training was advanced obedience training, an AKC advanced\n          behavior and obedience certification. This portion of\n          training and the AKC certification process cost $625.\n                From the defense -- from the defense standpoint, Your\n          Honor, one, it -- it is -- it is questionable whether Mr.\n          Martinez actually suffered posttraumatic stress disorder as\n          a result of this particular incident. . . .\n                THE COURT:   But there's no ques--\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:   They're not directly related \u2013-\n                THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], there's no question the\n          way -- I mean, the -- based on the facts of this case, the\n          way -- the behavior of your client -- of your client here\n          and everything, I mean, everybody has their -- has different\n          ways of re-- dealing with this kind of attack, verbal attack\n          that your client heaped on Mr. -- Mr. Martinez here.

(By [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) Okay. Ms. West, at the time --\n             at -- at the time of the complaint of injury, were you aware that\n             Mr. Martinez was under stress from a number of different causes,\n             including complaints that parents had made against him, his\n             inability to fill the football team, not knowing whether he was\n             going to have -- have a team to enter into the OIA that year \u2013-\n             . . . .\n                    Q.

Ct. No. 18CR019843)\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n        A jury convicted Anthony Morales of second degree murder for\nstabbing Eric McMillian outside a Greyhound station in Oakland.\nMorales contends the evidence was insufficient to support his\nconviction. He also argues the trial court erred by improperly\ninstructing the jury on self-defense and imperfect self-defense and\ndenying an instruction on voluntary intoxication. We disagree and\nshall affirm.\n                            BACKGROUND\n        In his youth in Watsonville, Morales had associated with gang\nmembers. He later distanced himself from the gang and, as a result,\ngang members had assaulted him and stabbed him twice. Morales\ntestified against a gang member related to one of the stabbings and in\nexchange was placed in a witness protection program in Oregon.\n        One day in December 2018, Morales was in Oakland waiting for a\nGreyhound bus to visit his family. His only luggage was a backpack\nthat contained, among other things, a seven and a half inch kitchen\n\n\n                                     1\n\fknife. Morales also had a butterfly knife in his pocket. Morales carried\nthe weapons for self-defense.\n      Morales arrived in Oakland at noon. When he tried to board a\nbus in the afternoon, Morales got into a fight with the bus station staff.\nMorales had persisted in trying to get on the wrong bus despite the\nstaff telling him he had the wrong ticket. The police arrived in\nresponse to a call and spoke to Morales, but they took no action because\nthe security guard did not want to press charges.\n      Morales testified that he kept his backpack on his shoulder\nunless he was inside, because he didn\u2019t want anyone to take his\nbelongings while he was at the station. However, the Greyhound\nstation\u2019s security cameras showed that around 8:30 p.m. he stood on\nthe sidewalk in front of the station for at least five minutes with his\nbackpack at his feet.\n      Later that night, around 9:00 p.m., Morales left the station with\nan unidentified man wearing a beanie hat and walked along the\nsidewalk towards the parking lot on the side of the building. Morales\ntestified that the two went to the parking lot so Morales could smoke a\ncigarette and the other man could use a vape with marijuana. The\nGreyhound station\u2019s video security cameras captured the two men\nwalking on the sidewalk in front of the building, but the area of the\nparking lot where the men stood was not visible to the security\ncameras.\n      Less than 15 seconds after arriving at the parking lot, the man\nwith the hat returned to the sidewalk in front of the bus station, while\nMorales stayed on the side of the building. Thirty seconds after that,\nMcMillian walked by and stepped around the corner of the building\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\finto the parking lot out of view of the camera. McMillian was wearing\nshorts, a coat, and a red hoodie. McMillian usually carried a backpack\nor bag of some sort when he left his apartment, but at this point he was\ncarrying only a bicycle wheel.\n      According to Morales, McMillian was taller and bigger than he.\nMcMillian asked Morales for a cigarette. Morales responded that he\ndid not have another but offered to give McMillian some change.\nMcMillian seemed to take offense to Morales\u2019 offer of change and said,\n\u201cIf I want your shit, I\u2019ll take your shit.\u201d Feeling threatened, Morales\nsaid McMillian could not take any of Morales\u2019 possessions, and Morales\ntook a step backward and turned to get away. As he was turning,\nMorales felt McMillian\u2019s fingers rake across his shoulder and pull on\nhis backpack. The force pulled Morales back around, and he saw that\nMcMillian was now holding his backpack. Morales also felt McMillian\nbrush against him, so Morales pushed McMillian.\n      Morales testified that he then backed out of the parking lot onto\nthe sidewalk at the corner of the station and McMillian walked toward\nhim. The security camera captured Morales as he backed onto the\nsidewalk without his backpack, about 40 seconds after McMillian\nstepped off the sidewalk into the parking lot. Morales said he walked\nback towards McMillian and demanded his backpack, then backed\naway again when McMillian did not return it.\n      According to Morales, McMillian then said, \u201cWhat else you got?\u201d\nBelieving McMillian was trying to take his cell phone and wallet,\nMorales lifted his shirt to reveal a knife in the waistband of his pants.\nMorales drew the knife, held it with the blade against his forearm, and\nraised his arm across his chest. Morales leaned back, and it seemed to\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\fhim that McMillian was moving closer to take the knife, so Morales\nsaid he lashed out by extending his arm straight. Based on a later\nautopsy, Morales drove his knife five and a half inches into McMillian\u2019s\ntorso.\n         At the time of the stabbing, the two men were on the edge of the\nvideo taken from the security camera and the details of the scene are\nsomewhat difficult to make out. The video does not show Morales\nlifting his shirt and it is difficult to tell when he drew the knife. But\nthe video does show that less than 15 seconds after Morales backed\nonto the sidewalk, he stepped forward toward McMillian and, in a\nbackhanded motion, stabbed at McMillian with a knife. McMillian\u2019s\narms were at his sides. Morales admitted that McMillian never drew a\nweapon, did not verbally threaten him, and never took a swing at him.\n         According to Morales, after stabbing McMillian he tried to get his\nbackpack, but McMillian walked towards him swinging punches.\nMcMillian fell down, got back up, picked up the backpack and bicycle\nwheel, and started swinging the wheel at Morales to keep Morales\naway. McMillian then walked quickly away, and Morales did not\npursue him. These interactions were mostly out of view of the security\ncamera, though the video reflects portions of them. Raymond Price,\nwho had exited the building and witnessed some of these interactions\nafter the stabbing, testified that Morales appeared to be the aggressor\nattacking McMillian, while McMillian was saying \u201cHey, man,\u201d\nshielding himself, and trying to get away.\n         McMillian walked from the parking lot to his nearby apartment\nbuilding, dripping blood on the sidewalk. With blood pouring out from\nhis shirt, he asked the front desk clerk to call 911. He asked another\n\n\n\n                                      4\n\fresident of the building to take the bicycle wheel and Morales\u2019\nbackpack up to the resident\u2019s room. While waiting for first responders,\nMcMillian said he had been robbed by a Mexican. McMillian was then\ntaken to the hospital where he died from his injuries.\n      Morales meanwhile dropped his knife at the corner of the parking\nlot. Morales then ran away from the sidewalk, alongside the building,\nthrough the parking lot. He testified that he ran to get the security\nguard at the bus loading area in the back of the building but turned\nback in the parking lot when he encountered a plastic fence blocking\nthe bus loading area. The cameras show him running through the\nparking lot alongside the building and turning back, but they do not\nshow any fence. Morales then smoked a cigarette in the front of the\nbuilding and went inside. The police detained Morales at the bus\nstation shortly afterwards.\n      The autopsy showed that McMillian\u2019s blood tested positive for\ncocaine, methadone, and a very low level of marijuana, as well as\nmetabolites of those substances. The pathologist explained that cocaine\ncan cause agitation, alertness, increased heart rate and blood pressure,\nand sweating. The cocaine level in McMillian\u2019s blood was significant\nbut not necessarily fatal, especially because the presence of significant\namounts of cocaine metabolite suggested he was a chronic user. For\nthe same reason, McMillian may have had more of a tolerance and not\nbeen exhibiting the effects of cocaine as acutely as someone who had\nnever used the drug before. The stab wound in McMillian\u2019s abdomen\npenetrated his stomach and liver and was the cause of his death.\nMcMillian had abrasions on his knees consistent with falling on\nconcrete. McMillian also had a superficial cut on the side of his thumb\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\ftowards the end from the knuckle, which could have been caused by\nhim trying to grab a knife but was more likely a defensive wound.\n      Morales had blood drawn at the police station, and his blood\ntested positive for methamphetamine and an antidepressant drug but\nnot amphetamine. The effects of methamphetamine are similar to\ncocaine and include agitation, sweating, high blood pressure, as well as\nsome level of psychosis, confusion, and aggression. The pathologist\nstated that methamphetamine is metabolized to amphetamine between\n1 and 12 hours after use, so the amount of methamphetamine in\nMorales\u2019 blood without any amphetamine was consistent with acute\nintoxication and indicated the methamphetamine had been recently\ntaken.\n      The pathologist told the jury that both cocaine and\nmethamphetamine can cause a condition called excited delirium.\nExcited delirium consists of excitement or agitation like a fight or flight\nreaction, and people with the condition will get agitated and can be\nphysically violent against things or people. People experiencing excited\ndelirium are also not responding appropriately to stimuli and may not\nunderstand instructions, may make growling or unintelligible sounds,\nand fight in an aggressive, desperate way with superhuman strength.\nThe state may end in exhaustion or death. The aggression of a person\nin excited delirium can arise because the person has paranoia and\nthinks people are coming after them. Although the levels of cocaine in\nMcMillian\u2019s blood were consistent with a state of excited delirium,\nwithout a description of McMillian\u2019s behavior, they were not sufficient\nfor the pathologist to say whether they caused McMillian to be in a\nstate of excited delirium.\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f      A psychologist, Dr. Laeeq Evered, testified for the defense that\nMorales had significant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his\nprior experiences with gangs and being stabbed. Dr. Evered opined\nthat if a person with significant PTSD were robbed in the dark in a\nstrange place, the event would be likely to trigger a fear response of\nfreeze, then fight or flight. A person with such a response would\ntypically have poor memory of the details of the incident, and as a\nresult might make up a story to explain the incident, perhaps by\nwatching a video of the incident, while believing the confabulated\nmemory to be true. Dr. Evered admitted that people with PTSD do not\nalways have a fear response to triggering events and that it was hard\nto know whether a person was acting out of a fear-based PTSD\nresponse or deciding to stab someone. Dr. Evered also acknowledged\nthat people with PTSD can get angry and act for reasons other than a\nfear response.\n      After a trial in July 2019, the jury found Morales not guilty of\nfirst degree murder but could not reach a verdict regarding second\ndegree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary\nmanslaughter. The trial court declared a mistrial. After a second trial\nin December 2019, the jury deliberated for about 17 hours over four\ndays before finding Morales guilty of second degree murder and finding\ntrue the allegation that he used a knife. The trial court sentenced\nMorales to 16 years to life in prison.\n                              DISCUSSION\n I.   Sufficiency of the evidence\n      Morales contends the evidence was not sufficient to support his\nconviction for second degree murder. \u201cSecond degree murder is the\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\funlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, but\nwithout the premeditation, deliberation and willfulness necessary to\nelevate the offense to first degree murder.\u201d (People v. Bohana (2000)\n84 Cal.App.4th 360, 368; Pen. Code,1 \u00a7 187, subd. (a).) Malice may be\nexpress or implied. (\u00a7 188, subd. (a).) \u201cMalice is express when there is\nmanifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a\nfellow creature.\u201d (\u00a7 188, subd. (a)(1).) \u201cMalice is implied when no\nconsiderable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending\nthe killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d (\u00a7 188,\nsubd. (a)(2).) The Supreme Court has \u201cinterpreted implied malice as\nhaving \u2018both a physical and a mental component. The physical\ncomponent is satisfied by the performance of \u201can act, the natural\nconsequences of which are dangerous to life.\u201d [Citation.] The mental\ncomponent is the requirement that the defendant \u201cknows that his\nconduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious\ndisregard for life.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Chun (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1181.)\n      Because Morales testified that he killed McMillian in self-\ndefense, the prosecution was also required to prove he did not act in\nself-defense or imperfect self-defense. (People v. Frye (1992)\n7 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1158\u20131159 [prosecution required to disprove\njustifications or excuses]; In re Walker (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 533, 537\n[prosecution required to disprove imperfect self-defense].) Under the\ndoctrine of self-defense, \u201ca homicide is justifiable and noncriminal\nwhere the actor possessed both an actual and reasonable belief in the\nneed to defend.\u201d (People v. Stitely (2005) 35 Cal.4th 514, 551.) Under\nthe doctrine of imperfect self-defense, \u201c[a]n unlawful killing involving\n\n\n      1   Undesignated statutory citations are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                     8\n\feither an intent to kill or a conscious disregard for life constitutes\nvoluntary manslaughter, rather than murder, when the defendant acts\nupon an actual but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n      \u201cGiven this court\u2019s limited role on appeal, [Morales] bears an\nenormous burden in claiming there was insufficient evidence to sustain\nhis conviction.\u201d (People v. Sanchez (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 325, 330.)\n\u201c \u2018The proper test for determining a claim of insufficiency of evidence in\na criminal case is whether, on the entire record, a rational trier of fact\ncould find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.]\nOn appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nPeople and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of\nevery fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\n[Citation.] [\u00b6] Although we must ensure the evidence is reasonable,\ncredible, and of solid value, nonetheless it is the exclusive province of\nthe trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the\ntruth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends.\n[Citation.] Thus, if the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we\nmust accord due deference to the trier of fact and not substitute our\nevaluation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the fact finder.\u2019 \u201d (People\nv. Ochoa (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206.) \u201cThe same standard applies\nwhen the conviction rests primarily on circumstantial evidence.\n[Citation.] Although it is the jury\u2019s duty to acquit a defendant if it finds\nthe circumstantial evidence susceptible of two reasonable\ninterpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it\nis the jury, not the appellate court that must be convinced of the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cIf the\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\fcircumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion\nof the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be\nreconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the\njudgment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Kraft (2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1053\u20131054.)\n      In his opening brief, Morales contends the evidence supporting\nhis conviction is insufficient because (1) there was not enough evidence\nthat he intended to kill McMillian, (2) the undisputed evidence of his\nPTSD precluded a finding that he acted with a conscious disregard for\nthe dangerousness of his actions, and (3) the prosecution failed to prove\nhe was not acting in imperfect self-defense. In his reply brief, however,\nMorales abandons the first argument by conceding that the evidence\nthat he struck first and used a knife to stab at McMillian\u2019s abdomen,\namong other things, supports a finding that he intended to kill. He\nnonetheless insists this evidence was insufficient under his third\nargument because the evidence shows his mental state was impacted\nby a fear of McMillian\u2019s robbery.\n      As the Attorney General points out, however, the jury was free to\ndisbelieve Morales\u2019 claim that he was afraid and acting in self-defense,\nespecially in light of the evidence to the contrary. (People v. Webb\n(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 83, 94\u201395.) Morales admitted that he lashed out\nat McMillian with a seven-inch knife with sufficient force to penetrate\nfive and a half inches into McMillian\u2019s abdomen. Price testified that\nimmediately after the stabbing Morales was the aggressor and\nMcMillian was trying to get away. The pathologist testified that\nMcMillian had a defensive wound on his thumb. The jury also saw the\nvideo of the stabbing, which shows that Morales wound up for his\nkilling stroke by leaning back and then stepped forward to McMillian,\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\fpurposefully driving his knife straight towards McMillian\u2019s abdomen.\nDuring the moments immediately preceding the stabbing, McMillian\ndid not appear to be menacing or threatening Morales, and McMillian\u2019s\narms never left his sides. The jury had a sufficient basis from which to\nconclude Morales intended to kill and was not acting in self-defense or\nimperfect self-defense.2\n      Morales\u2019 argument regarding implied malice and his PTSD\nevidence likewise falls short. Morales points out that Dr. Evered\u2019s\ntestimony that Morales suffered from PTSD was undisputed. Dr.\nEvered told the jury that if Morales were experiencing a fear response\ntriggered by his PTSD, Morales would have been unable to consciously\nconsider the risk to McMillian\u2019s life from Morales\u2019 actions. Morales\nargues no reasonable jury could conclude from this evidence that\nMorales was aware that his actions were dangerous and consciously\ndisregarded the risk.3\n      Morales cites no authority for his apparent assumption that the\njury was required to accept Dr. Evered\u2019s testimony about Morales\u2019\nPTSD. Such an assumption is contrary to the instruction to the jury,\n\n\n\n      2 Morales argues the jury verdict cannot be construed as a\nrejection of his claim of self-defense because of his separate argument\nthat the jury was not properly instructed that self-defense applies in\ncases of robbery. We reject this claim of instructional error for the\nreasons set out below.\n      3 Morales also mentions the evidence of his methamphetamine\nintoxication in support of his argument regarding implied malice. But\nas we discuss in further detail below in response to Morales\u2019 argument\nregarding his request for an instruction on voluntary intoxication,\nevidence of voluntary intoxication cannot be used to disprove implied\nmalice. (People v. Turk (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1376; \u00a7 29.4,\nsubds. (a)\u2013(b).)\n\n                                   11\n\fwhich Morales does not challenge, that the jury could believe all, part,\nor none of any witness\u2019s testimony. (See CALCRIM No. 226; see also,\ne.g., People v. Carrington (2009) 47 Cal.4th 145, 187 [jury was free to\ndisbelieve defendant\u2019s claim that she formed specific intent to rob\nvictim only after shooting him].) Assuming the jury did believe Dr.\nEvered\u2019s testimony on these points, the jury could still decide that\nMorales had implied malice despite the PTSD diagnosis. Dr. Evered\nadmitted that people with PTSD can act for reasons other than their\nPTSD, even in triggering situations. The jury could watch the video of\nMorales\u2019 actions and conclude from Morales\u2019 behavior and actions on\nthe video that he was not acting based on fear or PTSD at the time of\nthe stabbing, despite his and Dr. Evered\u2019s testimony to the contrary.\nWe cannot gainsay the jury\u2019s conclusion in this regard.\nII.   Instruction on self-defense to robbery\n      \u201cWe review a claim of instructional error de novo. [Citation.]\n\u2018Review of the adequacy of instructions is based on whether the trial\ncourt \u201cfully and fairly instructed on the applicable law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v.\nBarber (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 787, 798.) \u201cGenerally, the trial court is\nrequired to instruct the jury on the general principles of law that are\nclosely and openly connected with the evidence and that are necessary\nto the jury\u2019s understanding of the case. [Citation.] It also has a duty to\nrefrain from giving incorrect instructions or instructions on principles\nof law that are irrelevant and that would have the effect of confusing\nthe jury or relieving it from making findings on the relevant issues.\u201d\n(Id. at p. 799.)\n      The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with CALCRIM\nNo. 505 that Morales acted in lawful self-defense if (1) he reasonably\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\fbelieved that he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering\ngreat bodily injury, (2) he reasonably believed that the immediate use\nof deadly force was necessary to defend against that danger, and (3) he\nused no more force than was reasonably necessary. Morales asked the\ntrial court to modify the first element to include, apart from the\nimminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury, an\nimminent danger of being robbed or maimed. The trial court denied\nMorales\u2019 requested instruction, telling Morales\u2019 counsel that he could\ndiscuss robbery in his argument concerning the concepts of danger of\ngreat bodily injury or death, but that the danger had to be one of\nimminent death or great bodily injury.\n      Morales contends the trial court erred by denying his request to\nadd an imminent danger of robbery as a sufficient basis for the first\nelement of self-defense because his own testimony provided ample\nevidence that McMillian was committing a robbery. He argues the trial\ncourt mistakenly believed that self-defense was available only to\nrespond to a danger of great bodily injury or death. He relies primarily\non section 197, as construed in People v. Ceballos (1974) 12 Cal.3d 470\n(Ceballos).\n      Section 197 provides that homicide is justifiable \u201c[w]hen resisting\nany attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some\ngreat bodily injury upon any person\u201d or \u201c[w]hen committed in defense of\nhabitation, property, or person, against one who manifestly intends or\nendeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony.\u201d (\u00a7 197,\nsubds. (1)\u2013(2).) Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at pages 477\u2013478, limited\nthe meaning of \u201cfelony\u201d in these subdivisions because there are far\nmore felonies under modern criminal law than at early common law,\n\n\n\n                                    13\n\fand many modern felonies do not involve a danger of serious bodily\nharm. Following and expanding on People v. Jones (1961)\n191 Cal.App.2d 478, 481\u2013482, Ceballos therefore read section 197 as\npermitting the use of deadly force to prevent a felony only if the felony\nis \u201cforcible and atrocious.\u201d (Ceballos, at p. 478.) Ceballos then\nremarked, \u201cExamples of forcible and atrocious crimes are murder,\nmayhem, rape and robbery. (See Storey v. State [(1882)] 71 Ala. 329,\n340; 3 Greenleaf on Evidence (1899) p. 122.) In such crimes \u2018from their\natrocity and violence human life [(]or personal safety from great\nharm[)] either is, or is presumed to be, in peril.\u2019 \u201d (Ceballos, at pp. 478\u2013\n479.) Ceballos went on to hold that even though burglary had also been\nconsidered a forcible and atrocious crime, because burglary had a wide\nscope, not all burglaries would trigger the right to use deadly force in\nself-defense. (Id. at p. 479.) Ceballos therefore held that a defendant\nwho killed two burglars with a trap gun, when the defendant was not\non the property when it was burglarized, could not claim self-defense.\n(Id. at pp. 479\u2013480.)\n      Relying on Ceballos, Morales argues that the evidence that he\nwas resisting McMillian\u2019s attempt to rob him was itself a sufficient\nbasis for his requested instruction without regard to any danger of\ngreat bodily injury or death. Morales notes that CALCRIM No. 505,\nbased on Ceballos, provides bracketed language in the first element of\nthe self-defense instruction to allow a jury to find that element is\nsatisfied if a defendant reasonably believed the defendant was in\nimminent danger of death, great bodily injury, or being raped, maimed,\nor robbed. CALCRIM No. 505 further states in a bench note, \u201cIf the\ndefendant is asserting that he or she was resisting the commission of\n\n\n\n                                    14\n\fone of these felonies or another specific felony, the court should include\nthe bracketed language at the end of element 1 and select \u2018raped,\u2019\n\u2018maimed,\u2019 or \u2018robbed,\u2019 or insert another appropriate forcible and\natrocious crime. In all other cases involving death or great bodily\ninjury, the court should use element 1 without the bracketed language.\u201d\nMorales also cites People v. Young (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 641, 644,\nfn. 2, 650 (Young), which reversed a conviction because the trial court\nfailed to instruct the jury that homicide is justifiable when resisting an\nattempt to murder, commit a felony, or do great bodily injury.\n      Young and Ceballos notwithstanding, we are not convinced that a\nmere robbery, without more, will give rise to the right of self-defense\nwith deadly force. Young predated Ceballos and its restriction of\nsection 197 to forcible and atrocious felonies, so it is not helpful. Using\nCeballos\u2019 terminology, we conclude that robberies are not always\nforcible and atrocious, as they cover a wide scope of conduct. \u201cRobbery\nis the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of\nanother, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will,\naccomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d (\u00a7 211.) But the degree of\nforce involved is immaterial, and can be satisfied by wresting a purse\nfrom someone unwilling to part with it and stepping on her foot (People\nv. Burns (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1259), or even by politely\ntapping a person on the shoulder to indicate that she should step aside\nfrom a cash register (People v. Garcia (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1242,\n1246, disapproved of on other grounds by People v. Mosby (2004)\n33 Cal.4th 353). Where a robbery is accomplished through fear,\nmeanwhile, the fear need not pertain to physical safety at all and can\nbe a fear of injury to property. (\u00a7 212.) A robbery therefore cannot\n\n\n\n                                    15\n\ftrigger the right to use deadly force in self-defense unless the\ncircumstances of the robbery gave rise to a reasonable belief that the\nvictim would suffer great bodily injury or death. To be sure, many\nrobberies likely satisfy that standard, since, for example, a victim who\nsurrenders property in response to the brandishing of a weapon or what\nappears to be a deadly weapon could reasonably fear that the robber\nwould use it. (See, e.g., People v. Villa (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1429,\n1433 [pointing a metallic object that appeared to be a gun induced fear\nin victims and satisfied the fear element of robbery].) But the\ntouchstone for self-defense remains the reasonable belief of the danger\nof great bodily injury or death, not the threat of a robbery in and of\nitself.\n          Ceballos\u2019 remark that robbery is a forcible and atrocious crime\ndoes not convince us otherwise. Ceballos itself did not involve a\nrobbery, so the remark is dicta. Further, treating all robberies as\nforcible and atrocious crimes would be at odds with Ceballos\u2019 approach\nof examining whether the character and manner of the burglary at\nissue there threatened or could be reasonably believed to threaten\ndeath or serious bodily harm. (Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at p. 479.)\nThe corresponding instruction in another set of jury instructions,\nCALJIC Crim. 5.16, also states that robbery is a forcible and atrocious\ncrime, based on Ceballos. But as the use note for that instruction\nexplains, Ceballos \u201crelied upon an old Alabama case and an 1899\nevidence text, and those authors obviously had in mind the traditional\ncommon law robbery. Since Ceballos, other cases have expanded\nrobbery to include situations where very little force or threat of force is\ninvolved. In addition, some unarmed robberies would not meet the\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fdefinition of forcible and atrocious. Bearing in mind that in Ceballos,\nthe court was postulating a rule of reasonableness, it is suggested that\nif the trial court is in doubt whether the crime the victim was engaged\nin was in fact forcible and atrocious, using the first paragraph of the\ninstruction alone [concerning the threat of great bodily injury or death]\nwould permit the jury to determine appropriately the merits of the\nalleged defense.\u201d\n      The suggestion in this use note is sensible. As the court\nremarked in People v. Jones, supra, 191 Cal.App.2d at page 482 (on\nwhich Ceballos relied), \u201cAny civilized system of law recognizes the\nsupreme value of human life, and excuses or justifies its taking only in\ncases of apparent absolute necessity.\u201d For that reason, to determine\nwhether a person who fears being the victim of a crime may respond\nwith deadly force, \u201c[w]e must look further into the character of the\ncrime, and the manner of its perpetration,\u201d prohibiting the use of\ndeadly force when the character and manner of the crime \u201cdo not\nreasonably create a fear of great bodily harm.\u201d (Ibid.) The use of\ndeadly force is not necessary to prevent a robbery that is little more\nthan a purse snatching or to prevent harm to the purse. Neither the\nLegislature nor Ceballos can have intended to permit the victim of a\nrobbery to use deadly force in such situations.\n      In his reply brief, Morales advances a narrower argument that\nhis requested robbery instruction was necessary for the jury\u2019s\nunderstanding of the case because robbery can be accomplished by\ninstilling fear of bodily injury and that was the basis for his claim of\nself-defense. He believes the jury could not put these points together,\nbecause it was only told that Morales could resist an imminent attack,\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\fnot that he could use force to defend himself if he believed he was\nhaving property taken by use of fear of physical attack. His maintains\nthe jury should have been told how the fear of great bodily injury in the\ncontext of a robbery applied to the concept of self-defense.\n      This argument has no more merit than Morales\u2019 first position.\nPreliminarily, this theory does not match the instruction Morales\nrequested in the trial court, which presented fear of robbery as an\nalternative basis for self-defense to fear of great bodily injury or death,\nnot as a contributing factor to the fear of great bodily injury or death.\nMore importantly, the jury did not need to be instructed on self-defense\nin the context of a robbery. Because the trial court told the jury that\nMorales could use deadly force in self-defense if he reasonably feared\nan imminent attack that might result in death or great bodily injury, it\nwas unnecessary to go further and say he could use deadly force in self-\ndefense if he reasonably feared such an imminent attack as part of a\nrobbery. The instruction the trial court delivered thus necessarily\nencompassed the theory Morales advanced. The key question for the\npurposes of self-defense is not an attacker\u2019s motive for attacking, but\nthe sincerity and reasonableness of Morales\u2019 belief of an imminent\nattack. \u201cIn determining whether error has been committed in giving\njury instructions, we consider the instructions as a whole and assume\njurors are intelligent persons, capable of understanding and correlating\nall jury instructions which are given. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cInstructions should\nbe interpreted, if possible, so as to support the judgment rather than\ndefeat it if they are reasonably susceptible to such interpretation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Barber, supra, 55 Cal.App.5th at pp. 798\u2013799.) Considering\n\n\n\n\n                                    18\n\fthe instructions as a whole, the jury could evaluate Morales\u2019 theory\nusing the instructions the trial court provided.\n       Even if the trial court should have provided an instruction on the\nnarrow theory that Morales advances in his reply brief, the error was\nharmless under either the federal or state standards. (People v.\nGonzalez (2018) 5 Cal.5th 186, 199 [California Supreme Court has \u201cyet\nto determine whether a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on a requested\naffirmative defense instruction supported by substantial evidence is\nfederal constitutional error or state law error\u201d]; People v. Barber, supra,\n55 Cal.App.5th at p. 799 [error in refusing to give a requested pinpoint\ninstruction is reviewed under People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818,\n836].) As Morales admits, his defense focused on making the robbery a\npart of the basis for Morales\u2019 claim of fear. He raised the robbery and\nhis resulting fear numerous times in his testimony. His counsel raised\nthe robbery theory several times in closing argument as well. The jury\nnonetheless chose to convict Morales of second degree murder. This\nindicates that the jury did not accept Morales\u2019 claims that he used\ndeadly force because of a genuine and reasonable fear that McMillian\nwould inflict great bodily injury or kill him. Adding an additional\ninstruction that Morales could have acted in self-defense if he had a\nfear of great bodily injury or death due to robbery would not have\nchanged the jury\u2019s finding on this point.\nIII.   Instruction on imperfect self-defense\n       Morales next challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction on voluntary\nmanslaughter based on imperfect self-defense.4 In addition to\n\n\n\n       Morales did not object to this instruction below, but we may\n       4\n\nreview his argument here that the instruction was an incorrect\n\n                                    19\n\finstructing the jury on self-defense in accordance with CALCRIM\nNo. 505, the trial court instructed the jury using CALCRIM No. 571.\nThat instruction states that a killing that would otherwise be murder is\nreduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant kills because of\nimperfect self-defense. It further states that a defendant acts in\nimperfect self-defense if a defendant (1) actually believes that he or she\nis in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury\nand (2) actually believes that the immediate use of deadly force is\nnecessary to defend against the danger, but (3) at least one of those\nbeliefs is unreasonable.\n      Morales contends this instruction was insufficient because it\nfailed to tell the jury that a homicide also qualifies as voluntary\nmanslaughter and not murder when a defendant\u2019s beliefs in danger and\nthe need to use deadly force are reasonable but the sort of deadly force\nhe uses is excessive and more than necessary to repel the attack. He\nargues that if the jury found he reasonably believed he would suffer\ngreat bodily injury from McMillian in the course of the robbery and\nreasonably believed he needed to arm himself against McMillian, but\nfound that stabbing McMillian in the abdomen was more force than\nwas reasonably necessary, the jury could find him guilty of voluntary\nmanslaughter.\n      Our Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cnot every unreasonable\nbelief will support a claim of imperfect self-defense\u201d; rather, a\n\n\n\nstatement of the law if the instruction affected his substantial rights,\nmeaning it was reversible error under People v. Watson, supra,\n46 Cal.2d at p. 836. (\u00a7 1259; People v. Christopher (2006)\n137 Cal.App.4th 418, 427; People v. Rivera (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 141,\n146.)\n\n                                    20\n\fdefendant can claim imperfect self-defense based only on a belief \u201cthat,\nif reasonable, would support a claim of perfect self-defense.\u201d (People v.\nValencia (2008) 43 Cal.4th 268, 288.) For example, if a defendant\nunreasonably believes someone is going to punch him in the arm and\nstabs him to death in response, \u201cthis belief would not support a claim of\nimperfect self-defense for the reason that the belief, even if reasonable,\nwould not permit the use of deadly force.\u201d (Id. at p. 288, fn. 6.) In such\na scenario, the use of force would be excessive but still would not reduce\na homicide to voluntary manslaughter. Similarly here, if Morales\nreasonably believed he needed to use force against McMillian but used\nmore force than was necessary, then he could not claim perfect self-\ndefense. As a result, he cannot claim imperfect self-defense, either.\n      Moreover, Morales does not explain how his stabbing could be\nbased on his reasonable belief in the need to use of deadly force but still\nqualify as excessive.5 If Morales reasonably believed he needed to use\ndeadly force to prevent McMillian from harming him, his use of a single\nstab with his knife would appear to be reasonable. (Cf. Young, supra,\n214 Cal.App.2d at pp. 649\u2013650 [deadly force would be excessive if\ndefendant chased victim as victim ran away from fight and stabbed him\nafter he was lying on the ground].) Morales also cites no authority for\nhis position that one type of deadly force could be reasonable but\n\n\n      5To the extent Morales is making the related argument that the\ninstructions failed to inform the jury that he would be guilty only of\nvoluntary manslaughter if he had a sincere, but unreasonable, belief in\nthe need to use deadly force, we reject this claim as well. The\ninstructions informed the jury of precisely this point, and in any event,\nif Morales\u2019 sincere belief in the need to use deadly force was\nunreasonable, then by definition the use of deadly force would be\nexcessive.\n\n                                    21\n\fanother could be excessive. The relevant consideration is whether a\ndefendant uses more force than is necessary to repel an attack, not the\ntype of deadly force used by a defendant. (See People v. Hardin (2000)\n85 Cal.App.4th 625, 629\u2013630.)\n      Morales further argues that the trial court should have\ninstructed the jury that malice would be negated if they found that\nMorales killed out of an honest belief in the need to defend himself but\nused excessive force.. Morales is correct that imperfect self-defense\nconverts a homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter because it\nnegates the element of malice. (People v. Mayfield, (1997) 14 Cal.4th\n668, 777\u2013778, abrogated on other grounds by People v. Scott (2015)\n61 Cal.4th 363, 390, fn. 2.) But the negation of malice is immaterial for\nthe purposes of the jury. Mayfield did not hold, as Morales contends,\nthat the jury necessarily had to be instructed on how imperfect self-\ndefense impacts the concept of malice. (Ibid.) Although the instruction\nin Mayfield did explain that imperfect self-defense negated malice,\nMayfield found the instruction there sufficient because it made clear\nthat the question of whether an imperfect self-defense theory will\npreclude a murder conviction turns on the jury\u2019s assessment of whether\nthe defendant\u2019s belief in the need to use deadly force was sincere, even\nif unreasonable. (Ibid.) So, too, the instruction here.\n      People v. Genovese (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 817, 832, rejected the\nargument Morales now advances. Like Morales, Genovese contended\nthat the jury instructions erroneously failed to inform the jury that\nimperfect self-defense eliminates malice. (Id. at p. 825.) The court held\nthat \u201cit does not matter that the [] instructions failed to inform the jury\nthat imperfect defense of another would eliminate malice,\u201d explaining\n\n\n\n                                    22\n\fthat Genovese\u2019s \u201cargument is defeated by the plain language of the\ninstructions as given to the jury, that \u2018[a] killing that would otherwise\nbe murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter\u2019 if defendant acted in\nimperfect defense.\u201d (Id. at pp. 830\u2013831, 832.) As a result, it was\n\u201cimmaterial that the jury was not informed that, in fact, what was\ngoing on was that the jury was finding an \u2018absence of malice.\u2019 . . . The\ndefinition of malice may be interesting to lawyers and judges and law\nprofessors, but it does not aid the task of lay jurors to inform them that,\nwhen the defendant acts in an honest but unreasonable belief in the\nneed to defend another, he is acting without malice.\u201d (Id. at p. 831.)\nThe jury in Morales\u2019 trial received the same instruction. Like the\nGenovese court, we find that this instruction adequately explained that\nMorales would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he acted in\nimperfect self-defense, even if the jury found he had an intent to kill or\na conscious disregard for the danger of his actions. (Ibid.) We presume\nthe jury followed this instruction, despite not being told the underlying\nlegal rationale that the reduction of murder to voluntary manslaughter\nwould occur via the mechanism of negating malice. (People v. Barber,\nsupra, 55 Cal.App.5th at p. 799 [\u201c \u2018The crucial assumption underlying\nour constitutional system of trial by jury is that jurors generally\nunderstand and faithfully follow instructions\u2019 \u201d].)\nIV.   Failure to instruct on voluntary intoxication\n      Morales finally argues the trial court should have delivered an\ninstruction on voluntary intoxication. In the context of second degree\nmurder, evidence of a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication can negate a\nfinding that he harbored express malice, which is defined in section 188\nas an intent to kill unlawfully. (People v. Turk, supra, 164 Cal.App.4th\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\fat pp. 1376\u20131378; \u00a7 29.4, subd. (b); see People v. Soto (2018) 4 Cal.5th\n968, 975.) However, voluntary intoxication cannot negate a finding of\nimplied malice. (Turk, at p. 1376 [\u201ca defendant who unlawfully kills\nwithout express malice due to voluntary intoxication can still act with\nimplied malice, which voluntary intoxication cannot negate\u201d]; Soto, at\np. 977 [\u201cBy prohibiting evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate\nimplied malice, the Legislature apparently [intended] that a defendant\nwho acts with conscious disregard for life should be punished for\nmurder regardless of whether voluntary intoxication impaired his or\nher judgment\u201d]; \u00a7 29.4, subds. (a)\u2013(b).) A defendant is therefore\nentitled to an instruction on voluntary intoxication \u201conly when there is\nsubstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication and the\nintoxication affected the defendant\u2019s \u2018actual formation of specific\nintent.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 677.) \u201cIn\ndetermining whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a jury\ninstruction, the trial court does not determine the credibility of the\ndefense evidence, but only whether \u2018there was evidence which, if\nbelieved by the jury, was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Salas (2006) 37 Cal.4th 967, 982.)\n      Morales asked the court to deliver CALCRIM No. 625, which\ndefines voluntary intoxication and as relevant here states that a jury\nmay consider voluntary intoxication for the limited purpose of deciding\nwhether a defendant acted with the intent to kill. The trial court\ndenied Morales\u2019 request, stating, \u201cNo one touched upon that. No one\neven asked him about -- you know, you have the doctor talk about the\nmethamphetamine issue and then how within six hours it would\nprocess itself. It hadn\u2019t processed itself. So it\u2019s within the window, but\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\fnobody talked about that. Nobody asked that question. So that\u2019s the\nquestion. I\u2019m sitting here waiting and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n      We agree with the trial court that the evidence here was\ninsufficient to warrant an instruction on voluntary intoxication.\nMorales focuses on the testimony of the pathologist that Morales\u2019 blood\ntested positive for methamphetamine and the absence of metabolites\nwas \u201cconsistent with an acute intoxication.\u201d The pathologist testified\nthat these lab results indicated that Morales had recently taken the\nmethamphetamine, somewhere between 1 and 12 hours prior to his\nblood being drawn. The pathologist also explained that\nmethamphetamine can cause agitation, sweating, high blood pressure,\n\u201ceven a certain level of psychosis, confusion, aggression on some levels.\u201d\nAdditionally, the pathologist mentioned that cocaine and\nmethamphetamine can both cause excited delirium.\n      What is missing from this general testimony about the effects of\nmethamphetamine, however, is any indication that Morales\u2019 use of\nmethamphetamine affected his thought process in any way. This\nabsence is conspicuous, because, as the trial judge noted, Morales\u2019\ncounsel\u2019s questioning of the pathologist initially suggested that he\nintended to present a defense of voluntary intoxication. But Morales\u2019\ncounsel never completed the defense by presenting evidence regarding\nthe effects of methamphetamine on Morales\u2019 formation of an intent to\nkill, either from the pathologist or Morales himself. Morales\u2019 counsel\nhimself seemed to recognize this, since he described the testimony on\nvoluntary intoxication as \u201climited\u201d when he asked for the instruction.\nFor example, Morales\u2019 counsel never asked the pathologist which of the\neffects of methamphetamine Morales would have exhibited given the\n\n\n\n                                   25\n\famount found in his blood, or whether any of the described effects\nwould have prevented Morales from forming the intent to kill. Morales\u2019\ncounsel focused his questions to the pathologist on excited delirium as\nit relates to McMillian\u2019s use of cocaine and did not try to link excited\ndelirium to the level of methamphetamine in Morales\u2019 blood. Besides,\nthe pathologist also made clear that excited delirium cannot be\ndiagnosed from a toxicology report alone, but instead is diagnosed\nbased on a description of a person\u2019s conduct. Morales himself never\nmentioned using methamphetamine or raised any issue with respect to\nwhether the methamphetamine affected his formation of an intent to\nkill McMillian. Absent such evidence, the pathologist\u2019s testimony\nregarding the amount of methamphetamine in Morales\u2019 blood and the\ngeneral effects of methamphetamine was not sufficient to raise a\nreasonable doubt in the jury\u2019s mind about Morales\u2019 intent to kill.\n(People v. Salas, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 982.)\n      This case is similar in this regard to People v. Williams, supra,\n16 Cal.4th 635. Williams held that even if a few isolated references to\na defendant being \u201c \u2018spaced out,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018doped up,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018smokin\u2019 pretty\ntough\u2019 \u201d qualified as evidence that the defendant was intoxicated at the\ntime of the crime, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s\nrequest for a voluntary intoxication instruction because \u201cthere was no\nevidence at all that voluntary intoxication had any effect on [the]\ndefendant\u2019s ability to formulate intent.\u201d (Id. at pp. 677\u2013678.) Similarly\nhere, even if the pathologist\u2019s testimony could qualify as substantial\nevidence that Morales was intoxicated, in the absence of evidence that\nhis intoxication had any effect on his formation of the intent to kill, the\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\ftrial court correctly refused his request for an instruction on the effects\nof voluntary intoxication.\n      In a fallback argument, Morales argues that any insufficiency of\nthe evidence to support a voluntary intoxication instruction\ndemonstrates his trial counsel was constitutionally insufficient. He\ncontends that Morales\u2019 counsel\u2019s questioning of the pathologist and\nrequest for the instruction indicates that his counsel intended to lay the\nfoundation for a voluntary intoxication defense, so that his failure to\nelicit the necessary testimony fell below reasonable professional\nstandards.\n      \u201cTo demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, [Morales] \u2018must\nshow that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficiency\nprejudiced the defense.\u2019 [Citation.] On direct appeal, a finding of\ndeficient performance is warranted where \u2018(1) the record affirmatively\ndiscloses counsel had no rational tactical purpose for the challenged act\nor omission, (2) counsel was asked for a reason and failed to provide\none, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory explanation.\u2019\n[Citation.] \u2018[W]here counsel\u2019s trial tactics or strategic reasons for\nchallenged decisions do not appear on the record, we will not find\nineffective assistance of counsel on appeal unless there could be no\nconceivable reason for counsel\u2019s acts or omissions.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Johnsen\n(2021) 10 Cal.5th 1116, 1165.)\n      We cannot say in this direct appeal that Morales\u2019 trial counsel\nwas ineffective for failing to elicit the final piece of testimony regarding\nMorales\u2019 intoxication. Despite asking for the instruction at the end of\ntrial, his counsel could have rationally decided earlier that it was better\nnot to rely on Morales\u2019 use of methamphetamine for his defense.\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fMorales\u2019 counsel\u2019s admission that the evidence regarding voluntary\nintoxication was limited suggests this was in fact a tactical decision.\nEvidence of voluntary intoxication at most would have defeated a\nfinding that he acted with express malice. The jury could still have\nconvicted Morales based on a finding of implied malice. The evidence\nat trial supported an implied malice theory, since the jury could have\nconcluded that thrusting a seven-inch knife towards McMillian\u2019s\nabdomen demonstrated Morales had a conscious disregard for\nMcMillian\u2019s life, even if Morales did not actually intend to take his life.\nMorales\u2019 counsel could have reasonably concluded that the benefit from\nrelying on Morales\u2019 methamphetamine use to defeat a finding of\nexpress malice was not worth the risk of losing the sympathy of the\njury and thereby making a conviction based on an implied malice\ntheory more likely.6\n                              DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                            BROWN, J.\n\nI CONCUR:\n\nTUCHER, J.\uf02a\nPeople v. Morales (A159825)\n\n\n\n\n       6Because we find the trial court committed no error, we need not\nconsider Morales\u2019 contention that the cumulative effects of multiple\nerrors in his trial made it fundamentally unfair in violation of due\nprocess.\n       \uf02a\n        Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate\nDistrict, Division Three, sitting by assignment pursuant to article VI,\nsection 6 of the California Constitution.\n\n                                    28\n\fSTREETER, Acting P. J., Concurring.\n      I agree with the lead opinion that the imminent danger of\nrobbery Morales faced was not sufficient to warrant his requested\npinpoint instruction on self-defense, but I am reluctant to reject his\nclaimed entitlement to that instruction as categorically as my\ncolleagues do. In support of his claim of error, Morales does not suggest\nthat \u201call robberies\u201d ought to be treated as forcible and atrocious felonies\nas a matter of law, so I see no need to expound on whether the\nillustrative reference to robbery in People v. Ceballos (1974) 12 Cal.3d\n470, 478, was dicta or not. We should tread carefully in dealing with\nwhat may appear to be statements extraneous to the precise holding of\na Supreme Court case. (Hubbard v. Superior Court (1997)\n66 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1169 [\u201c \u2018Even if properly characterized as dictum,\nstatements of the Supreme Court should be considered persuasive.\u2019 \u201d].)\nWhat Morales contends is that, on this record, there was substantial\nevidence to support his proposed instruction. We need go no further\nthan to answer that question on the specific facts of this case.\n      The felony-resistance defense contained in Penal Code\nsection 197, subdivision (1), is a codification of the traditional common\nlaw felony-resistance defense. (People v. Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at\npp. 477\u2013478; People v. Jones (1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 478, 481.) Where\nstatutes are merely codifications of the common law, we must assume\nthey are limited by the corresponding traditional common law rules.\n(Parsley v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 934, 938\u2013939.) Virtually all\nforms of the common law doctrine of justification contain an element of\nobjective reasonableness. (People v. Uriarte (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 192,\n197; see generally Note, Justification for the Use of Force in the\n\n\n\n                                     1\n\fCriminal Law (1961) 13 Stan. L.Rev. 566.) An objective reasonableness\nrequirement is therefore implied in the statutory version of the defense\nMorales proposed as the frame for his requested pinpoint instruction.\n      There is a subjective element to the defense as well. Felony-\nresistance is not available as an excuse or justification unless the\ndefendant actually and reasonably believes in the need to use deadly\nforce. \u201cA homicide is considered justified as self-defense where the\ndefendant actually and reasonably believed the use of deadly force was\nnecessary to defend himself from imminent threat of death or great\nbodily injury. Under such circumstances, the killing is not a crime.\n[Citations] Where the defendant kills while actually but unreasonably\nbelieving the use of deadly force was necessary, defendant is considered\nto have acted in imperfect self-defense. Imperfect self-defense is not a\ncomplete defense to a killing, but negates the malice element and\nreduces the offense to voluntary manslaughter. [Citations.] \u2018The\nsubjective elements of self-defense and imperfect self-defense are\nidentical. Under each theory, the [defendant] must actually believe in\nthe need to defend . . . against imminent peril to life or great bodily\ninjury.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Sotelo-Urena (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 732, 744.)\n      Drawing inferences from the record in favor of Morales, he was\nan indigent person carrying all of his possessions in his backpack and\nhe attempted to ward off an attempt to strip him by force of everything\nhe owned. None of us has ever been in that situation, but in applying\nthe requisite test of actually perceived peril and reasonableness, we\nmust make an effort to put ourselves in the shoes of someone reacting\nto a threat so profound that it struck at the victim\u2019s fundamental sense\nof personal security. (Cf. People v. Humphrey (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1073,\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\f1083 [in a homicide case involving an attempt to present expert\ntestimony supporting a battered women\u2019s syndrome claim of self-\ndefense, \u201c[a]lthough the ultimate test of reasonableness is objective, in\ndetermining whether a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would\nhave believed in the need to defend, the jury must consider all of the\nrelevant circumstances in which a defendant found herself.\u201d].) For a\nperson so impoverished that he owns nothing else, there could be\ncircumstances in which a threatened taking of property meets this test.\n      Even looking at things in this case through that prism, on these\nspecific facts I conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the\nrequested pinpoint instruction. It does not appear to me that Morales\neither actually or reasonably believed that the taking of his backpack\nwas such a serious threat to his person that deadly force was necessary\nto repel it. I can imagine additional circumstances showing that\nMorales, acting out of the sense of desperate hypervigilance that life on\nthe streets sometimes engenders, might have perceived extreme danger\nwhere others accustomed to greater personal security would not. (See\nPeople v. Sotelo-Urena, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at pp. 745\u2013746 [reversing\nfirst degree murder conviction based on erroneous refusal to allow\ntestimony from expert who was prepared to explain \u201cthat individuals\nwho are chronically homeless . . . are subjected to a high rate of\nviolence by both housed and homeless individuals, and that the\nexperience of living for years on the streets instills a perpetual fear of\nviolence that would have affected defendant\u2019s belief in the need to\ndefend himself with lethal force\u201d].) But no such circumstances were\nshown here.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f      The mental-state defense in this case, put on through an expert,\nwas that Morales, a former gang member who had cut his ties with his\nformer gang associates and who had been beaten and attacked multiple\ntimes for doing so, suffered from severe posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) that was easily triggered by perceived threats. Due to his past\nentanglement with gang life, he was, in short, a person with a hair-\ntrigger for violence when he came under threat. That has nothing to do\nwith some deep sense of attachment to his belongings. Other than his\ngang past, there is very little in the record about Morales\u2019s life\ncircumstances at the time of the crime. He appears to have been an\nindigent drifter, and he testified that his backpack contained\neverything he had, including clothes and medications\u2014\u201call my stuff,\u201d\nas he put it\u2014but the focus of his defense was solely on his heightened\nsense of vulnerability to physical attack based on his gang history, not\non a concern about someone taking all of his \u201cstuff \u201d as a trigger for a\nPTSD-induced perpetual fear of violence.\n      On some other record, I would not rule out the possibility that\nthere could be a threatened robbery sufficiently serious to qualify as a\nforcible and atrocious felony, but we do not have that record here. With\nthis slight qualification, I concur fully in the opinion.\n                                             STREETER, Acting P.

Ct. No. 18CR019843)\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n        A jury convicted Anthony Morales of second degree murder for\nstabbing Eric McMillian outside a Greyhound station in Oakland.\nMorales contends the evidence was insufficient to support his\nconviction. He also argues the trial court erred by improperly\ninstructing the jury on self-defense and imperfect self-defense and\ndenying an instruction on voluntary intoxication. We disagree and\nshall affirm.\n                            BACKGROUND\n        In his youth in Watsonville, Morales had associated with gang\nmembers. He later distanced himself from the gang and, as a result,\ngang members had assaulted him and stabbed him twice. Morales\ntestified against a gang member related to one of the stabbings and in\nexchange was placed in a witness protection program in Oregon.\n        One day in December 2018, Morales was in Oakland waiting for a\nGreyhound bus to visit his family. His only luggage was a backpack\nthat contained, among other things, a seven and a half inch kitchen\n\n\n                                     1\n\fknife. Morales also had a butterfly knife in his pocket. Morales carried\nthe weapons for self-defense.\n      Morales arrived in Oakland at noon. When he tried to board a\nbus in the afternoon, Morales got into a fight with the bus station staff.\nMorales had persisted in trying to get on the wrong bus despite the\nstaff telling him he had the wrong ticket. The police arrived in\nresponse to a call and spoke to Morales, but they took no action because\nthe security guard did not want to press charges.\n      Morales testified that he kept his backpack on his shoulder\nunless he was inside, because he didn\u2019t want anyone to take his\nbelongings while he was at the station. However, the Greyhound\nstation\u2019s security cameras showed that around 8:30 p.m. he stood on\nthe sidewalk in front of the station for at least five minutes with his\nbackpack at his feet.\n      Later that night, around 9:00 p.m., Morales left the station with\nan unidentified man wearing a beanie hat and walked along the\nsidewalk towards the parking lot on the side of the building. Morales\ntestified that the two went to the parking lot so Morales could smoke a\ncigarette and the other man could use a vape with marijuana. The\nGreyhound station\u2019s video security cameras captured the two men\nwalking on the sidewalk in front of the building, but the area of the\nparking lot where the men stood was not visible to the security\ncameras.\n      Less than 15 seconds after arriving at the parking lot, the man\nwith the hat returned to the sidewalk in front of the bus station, while\nMorales stayed on the side of the building. Thirty seconds after that,\nMcMillian walked by and stepped around the corner of the building\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\finto the parking lot out of view of the camera. McMillian was wearing\nshorts, a coat, and a red hoodie. McMillian usually carried a backpack\nor bag of some sort when he left his apartment, but at this point he was\ncarrying only a bicycle wheel.\n      According to Morales, McMillian was taller and bigger than he.\nMcMillian asked Morales for a cigarette. Morales responded that he\ndid not have another but offered to give McMillian some change.\nMcMillian seemed to take offense to Morales\u2019 offer of change and said,\n\u201cIf I want your shit, I\u2019ll take your shit.\u201d Feeling threatened, Morales\nsaid McMillian could not take any of Morales\u2019 possessions, and Morales\ntook a step backward and turned to get away. As he was turning,\nMorales felt McMillian\u2019s fingers rake across his shoulder and pull on\nhis backpack. The force pulled Morales back around, and he saw that\nMcMillian was now holding his backpack. Morales also felt McMillian\nbrush against him, so Morales pushed McMillian.\n      Morales testified that he then backed out of the parking lot onto\nthe sidewalk at the corner of the station and McMillian walked toward\nhim. The security camera captured Morales as he backed onto the\nsidewalk without his backpack, about 40 seconds after McMillian\nstepped off the sidewalk into the parking lot. Morales said he walked\nback towards McMillian and demanded his backpack, then backed\naway again when McMillian did not return it.\n      According to Morales, McMillian then said, \u201cWhat else you got?\u201d\nBelieving McMillian was trying to take his cell phone and wallet,\nMorales lifted his shirt to reveal a knife in the waistband of his pants.\nMorales drew the knife, held it with the blade against his forearm, and\nraised his arm across his chest. Morales leaned back, and it seemed to\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\fhim that McMillian was moving closer to take the knife, so Morales\nsaid he lashed out by extending his arm straight. Based on a later\nautopsy, Morales drove his knife five and a half inches into McMillian\u2019s\ntorso.\n         At the time of the stabbing, the two men were on the edge of the\nvideo taken from the security camera and the details of the scene are\nsomewhat difficult to make out. The video does not show Morales\nlifting his shirt and it is difficult to tell when he drew the knife. But\nthe video does show that less than 15 seconds after Morales backed\nonto the sidewalk, he stepped forward toward McMillian and, in a\nbackhanded motion, stabbed at McMillian with a knife. McMillian\u2019s\narms were at his sides. Morales admitted that McMillian never drew a\nweapon, did not verbally threaten him, and never took a swing at him.\n         According to Morales, after stabbing McMillian he tried to get his\nbackpack, but McMillian walked towards him swinging punches.\nMcMillian fell down, got back up, picked up the backpack and bicycle\nwheel, and started swinging the wheel at Morales to keep Morales\naway. McMillian then walked quickly away, and Morales did not\npursue him. These interactions were mostly out of view of the security\ncamera, though the video reflects portions of them. Raymond Price,\nwho had exited the building and witnessed some of these interactions\nafter the stabbing, testified that Morales appeared to be the aggressor\nattacking McMillian, while McMillian was saying \u201cHey, man,\u201d\nshielding himself, and trying to get away.\n         McMillian walked from the parking lot to his nearby apartment\nbuilding, dripping blood on the sidewalk. With blood pouring out from\nhis shirt, he asked the front desk clerk to call 911. He asked another\n\n\n\n                                      4\n\fresident of the building to take the bicycle wheel and Morales\u2019\nbackpack up to the resident\u2019s room. While waiting for first responders,\nMcMillian said he had been robbed by a Mexican. McMillian was then\ntaken to the hospital where he died from his injuries.\n      Morales meanwhile dropped his knife at the corner of the parking\nlot. Morales then ran away from the sidewalk, alongside the building,\nthrough the parking lot. He testified that he ran to get the security\nguard at the bus loading area in the back of the building but turned\nback in the parking lot when he encountered a plastic fence blocking\nthe bus loading area. The cameras show him running through the\nparking lot alongside the building and turning back, but they do not\nshow any fence. Morales then smoked a cigarette in the front of the\nbuilding and went inside. The police detained Morales at the bus\nstation shortly afterwards.\n      The autopsy showed that McMillian\u2019s blood tested positive for\ncocaine, methadone, and a very low level of marijuana, as well as\nmetabolites of those substances. The pathologist explained that cocaine\ncan cause agitation, alertness, increased heart rate and blood pressure,\nand sweating. The cocaine level in McMillian\u2019s blood was significant\nbut not necessarily fatal, especially because the presence of significant\namounts of cocaine metabolite suggested he was a chronic user. For\nthe same reason, McMillian may have had more of a tolerance and not\nbeen exhibiting the effects of cocaine as acutely as someone who had\nnever used the drug before. The stab wound in McMillian\u2019s abdomen\npenetrated his stomach and liver and was the cause of his death.\nMcMillian had abrasions on his knees consistent with falling on\nconcrete. McMillian also had a superficial cut on the side of his thumb\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\ftowards the end from the knuckle, which could have been caused by\nhim trying to grab a knife but was more likely a defensive wound.\n      Morales had blood drawn at the police station, and his blood\ntested positive for methamphetamine and an antidepressant drug but\nnot amphetamine. The effects of methamphetamine are similar to\ncocaine and include agitation, sweating, high blood pressure, as well as\nsome level of psychosis, confusion, and aggression. The pathologist\nstated that methamphetamine is metabolized to amphetamine between\n1 and 12 hours after use, so the amount of methamphetamine in\nMorales\u2019 blood without any amphetamine was consistent with acute\nintoxication and indicated the methamphetamine had been recently\ntaken.\n      The pathologist told the jury that both cocaine and\nmethamphetamine can cause a condition called excited delirium.\nExcited delirium consists of excitement or agitation like a fight or flight\nreaction, and people with the condition will get agitated and can be\nphysically violent against things or people. People experiencing excited\ndelirium are also not responding appropriately to stimuli and may not\nunderstand instructions, may make growling or unintelligible sounds,\nand fight in an aggressive, desperate way with superhuman strength.\nThe state may end in exhaustion or death. The aggression of a person\nin excited delirium can arise because the person has paranoia and\nthinks people are coming after them. Although the levels of cocaine in\nMcMillian\u2019s blood were consistent with a state of excited delirium,\nwithout a description of McMillian\u2019s behavior, they were not sufficient\nfor the pathologist to say whether they caused McMillian to be in a\nstate of excited delirium.\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f      A psychologist, Dr. Laeeq Evered, testified for the defense that\nMorales had significant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his\nprior experiences with gangs and being stabbed. Dr. Evered opined\nthat if a person with significant PTSD were robbed in the dark in a\nstrange place, the event would be likely to trigger a fear response of\nfreeze, then fight or flight. A person with such a response would\ntypically have poor memory of the details of the incident, and as a\nresult might make up a story to explain the incident, perhaps by\nwatching a video of the incident, while believing the confabulated\nmemory to be true. Dr. Evered admitted that people with PTSD do not\nalways have a fear response to triggering events and that it was hard\nto know whether a person was acting out of a fear-based PTSD\nresponse or deciding to stab someone. Dr. Evered also acknowledged\nthat people with PTSD can get angry and act for reasons other than a\nfear response.\n      After a trial in July 2019, the jury found Morales not guilty of\nfirst degree murder but could not reach a verdict regarding second\ndegree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary\nmanslaughter. The trial court declared a mistrial. After a second trial\nin December 2019, the jury deliberated for about 17 hours over four\ndays before finding Morales guilty of second degree murder and finding\ntrue the allegation that he used a knife. The trial court sentenced\nMorales to 16 years to life in prison.\n                              DISCUSSION\n I.   Sufficiency of the evidence\n      Morales contends the evidence was not sufficient to support his\nconviction for second degree murder. \u201cSecond degree murder is the\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\funlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, but\nwithout the premeditation, deliberation and willfulness necessary to\nelevate the offense to first degree murder.\u201d (People v. Bohana (2000)\n84 Cal.App.4th 360, 368; Pen. Code,1 \u00a7 187, subd. (a).) Malice may be\nexpress or implied. (\u00a7 188, subd. (a).) \u201cMalice is express when there is\nmanifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a\nfellow creature.\u201d (\u00a7 188, subd. (a)(1).) \u201cMalice is implied when no\nconsiderable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending\nthe killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d (\u00a7 188,\nsubd. (a)(2).) The Supreme Court has \u201cinterpreted implied malice as\nhaving \u2018both a physical and a mental component. The physical\ncomponent is satisfied by the performance of \u201can act, the natural\nconsequences of which are dangerous to life.\u201d [Citation.] The mental\ncomponent is the requirement that the defendant \u201cknows that his\nconduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious\ndisregard for life.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Chun (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1181.)\n      Because Morales testified that he killed McMillian in self-\ndefense, the prosecution was also required to prove he did not act in\nself-defense or imperfect self-defense. (People v. Frye (1992)\n7 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1158\u20131159 [prosecution required to disprove\njustifications or excuses]; In re Walker (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 533, 537\n[prosecution required to disprove imperfect self-defense].) Under the\ndoctrine of self-defense, \u201ca homicide is justifiable and noncriminal\nwhere the actor possessed both an actual and reasonable belief in the\nneed to defend.\u201d (People v. Stitely (2005) 35 Cal.4th 514, 551.) Under\nthe doctrine of imperfect self-defense, \u201c[a]n unlawful killing involving\n\n\n      1   Undesignated statutory citations are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                     8\n\feither an intent to kill or a conscious disregard for life constitutes\nvoluntary manslaughter, rather than murder, when the defendant acts\nupon an actual but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense.\u201d\n(Ibid.)\n      \u201cGiven this court\u2019s limited role on appeal, [Morales] bears an\nenormous burden in claiming there was insufficient evidence to sustain\nhis conviction.\u201d (People v. Sanchez (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 325, 330.)\n\u201c \u2018The proper test for determining a claim of insufficiency of evidence in\na criminal case is whether, on the entire record, a rational trier of fact\ncould find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.]\nOn appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nPeople and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of\nevery fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\n[Citation.] [\u00b6] Although we must ensure the evidence is reasonable,\ncredible, and of solid value, nonetheless it is the exclusive province of\nthe trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the\ntruth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends.\n[Citation.] Thus, if the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we\nmust accord due deference to the trier of fact and not substitute our\nevaluation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the fact finder.\u2019 \u201d (People\nv. Ochoa (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206.) \u201cThe same standard applies\nwhen the conviction rests primarily on circumstantial evidence.\n[Citation.] Although it is the jury\u2019s duty to acquit a defendant if it finds\nthe circumstantial evidence susceptible of two reasonable\ninterpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it\nis the jury, not the appellate court that must be convinced of the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cIf the\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\fcircumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion\nof the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be\nreconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the\njudgment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Kraft (2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1053\u20131054.)\n      In his opening brief, Morales contends the evidence supporting\nhis conviction is insufficient because (1) there was not enough evidence\nthat he intended to kill McMillian, (2) the undisputed evidence of his\nPTSD precluded a finding that he acted with a conscious disregard for\nthe dangerousness of his actions, and (3) the prosecution failed to prove\nhe was not acting in imperfect self-defense. In his reply brief, however,\nMorales abandons the first argument by conceding that the evidence\nthat he struck first and used a knife to stab at McMillian\u2019s abdomen,\namong other things, supports a finding that he intended to kill. He\nnonetheless insists this evidence was insufficient under his third\nargument because the evidence shows his mental state was impacted\nby a fear of McMillian\u2019s robbery.\n      As the Attorney General points out, however, the jury was free to\ndisbelieve Morales\u2019 claim that he was afraid and acting in self-defense,\nespecially in light of the evidence to the contrary. (People v. Webb\n(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 83, 94\u201395.) Morales admitted that he lashed out\nat McMillian with a seven-inch knife with sufficient force to penetrate\nfive and a half inches into McMillian\u2019s abdomen. Price testified that\nimmediately after the stabbing Morales was the aggressor and\nMcMillian was trying to get away. The pathologist testified that\nMcMillian had a defensive wound on his thumb. The jury also saw the\nvideo of the stabbing, which shows that Morales wound up for his\nkilling stroke by leaning back and then stepped forward to McMillian,\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\fpurposefully driving his knife straight towards McMillian\u2019s abdomen.\nDuring the moments immediately preceding the stabbing, McMillian\ndid not appear to be menacing or threatening Morales, and McMillian\u2019s\narms never left his sides. The jury had a sufficient basis from which to\nconclude Morales intended to kill and was not acting in self-defense or\nimperfect self-defense.2\n      Morales\u2019 argument regarding implied malice and his PTSD\nevidence likewise falls short. Morales points out that Dr. Evered\u2019s\ntestimony that Morales suffered from PTSD was undisputed. Dr.\nEvered told the jury that if Morales were experiencing a fear response\ntriggered by his PTSD, Morales would have been unable to consciously\nconsider the risk to McMillian\u2019s life from Morales\u2019 actions. Morales\nargues no reasonable jury could conclude from this evidence that\nMorales was aware that his actions were dangerous and consciously\ndisregarded the risk.3\n      Morales cites no authority for his apparent assumption that the\njury was required to accept Dr. Evered\u2019s testimony about Morales\u2019\nPTSD. Such an assumption is contrary to the instruction to the jury,\n\n\n\n      2 Morales argues the jury verdict cannot be construed as a\nrejection of his claim of self-defense because of his separate argument\nthat the jury was not properly instructed that self-defense applies in\ncases of robbery. We reject this claim of instructional error for the\nreasons set out below.\n      3 Morales also mentions the evidence of his methamphetamine\nintoxication in support of his argument regarding implied malice. But\nas we discuss in further detail below in response to Morales\u2019 argument\nregarding his request for an instruction on voluntary intoxication,\nevidence of voluntary intoxication cannot be used to disprove implied\nmalice. (People v. Turk (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1376; \u00a7 29.4,\nsubds. (a)\u2013(b).)\n\n                                   11\n\fwhich Morales does not challenge, that the jury could believe all, part,\nor none of any witness\u2019s testimony. (See CALCRIM No. 226; see also,\ne.g., People v. Carrington (2009) 47 Cal.4th 145, 187 [jury was free to\ndisbelieve defendant\u2019s claim that she formed specific intent to rob\nvictim only after shooting him].) Assuming the jury did believe Dr.\nEvered\u2019s testimony on these points, the jury could still decide that\nMorales had implied malice despite the PTSD diagnosis. Dr. Evered\nadmitted that people with PTSD can act for reasons other than their\nPTSD, even in triggering situations. The jury could watch the video of\nMorales\u2019 actions and conclude from Morales\u2019 behavior and actions on\nthe video that he was not acting based on fear or PTSD at the time of\nthe stabbing, despite his and Dr. Evered\u2019s testimony to the contrary.\nWe cannot gainsay the jury\u2019s conclusion in this regard.\nII.   Instruction on self-defense to robbery\n      \u201cWe review a claim of instructional error de novo. [Citation.]\n\u2018Review of the adequacy of instructions is based on whether the trial\ncourt \u201cfully and fairly instructed on the applicable law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v.\nBarber (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 787, 798.) \u201cGenerally, the trial court is\nrequired to instruct the jury on the general principles of law that are\nclosely and openly connected with the evidence and that are necessary\nto the jury\u2019s understanding of the case. [Citation.] It also has a duty to\nrefrain from giving incorrect instructions or instructions on principles\nof law that are irrelevant and that would have the effect of confusing\nthe jury or relieving it from making findings on the relevant issues.\u201d\n(Id. at p. 799.)\n      The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with CALCRIM\nNo. 505 that Morales acted in lawful self-defense if (1) he reasonably\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\fbelieved that he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering\ngreat bodily injury, (2) he reasonably believed that the immediate use\nof deadly force was necessary to defend against that danger, and (3) he\nused no more force than was reasonably necessary. Morales asked the\ntrial court to modify the first element to include, apart from the\nimminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury, an\nimminent danger of being robbed or maimed. The trial court denied\nMorales\u2019 requested instruction, telling Morales\u2019 counsel that he could\ndiscuss robbery in his argument concerning the concepts of danger of\ngreat bodily injury or death, but that the danger had to be one of\nimminent death or great bodily injury.\n      Morales contends the trial court erred by denying his request to\nadd an imminent danger of robbery as a sufficient basis for the first\nelement of self-defense because his own testimony provided ample\nevidence that McMillian was committing a robbery. He argues the trial\ncourt mistakenly believed that self-defense was available only to\nrespond to a danger of great bodily injury or death. He relies primarily\non section 197, as construed in People v. Ceballos (1974) 12 Cal.3d 470\n(Ceballos).\n      Section 197 provides that homicide is justifiable \u201c[w]hen resisting\nany attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some\ngreat bodily injury upon any person\u201d or \u201c[w]hen committed in defense of\nhabitation, property, or person, against one who manifestly intends or\nendeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony.\u201d (\u00a7 197,\nsubds. (1)\u2013(2).) Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at pages 477\u2013478, limited\nthe meaning of \u201cfelony\u201d in these subdivisions because there are far\nmore felonies under modern criminal law than at early common law,\n\n\n\n                                    13\n\fand many modern felonies do not involve a danger of serious bodily\nharm. Following and expanding on People v. Jones (1961)\n191 Cal.App.2d 478, 481\u2013482, Ceballos therefore read section 197 as\npermitting the use of deadly force to prevent a felony only if the felony\nis \u201cforcible and atrocious.\u201d (Ceballos, at p. 478.) Ceballos then\nremarked, \u201cExamples of forcible and atrocious crimes are murder,\nmayhem, rape and robbery. (See Storey v. State [(1882)] 71 Ala. 329,\n340; 3 Greenleaf on Evidence (1899) p. 122.) In such crimes \u2018from their\natrocity and violence human life [(]or personal safety from great\nharm[)] either is, or is presumed to be, in peril.\u2019 \u201d (Ceballos, at pp. 478\u2013\n479.) Ceballos went on to hold that even though burglary had also been\nconsidered a forcible and atrocious crime, because burglary had a wide\nscope, not all burglaries would trigger the right to use deadly force in\nself-defense. (Id. at p. 479.) Ceballos therefore held that a defendant\nwho killed two burglars with a trap gun, when the defendant was not\non the property when it was burglarized, could not claim self-defense.\n(Id. at pp. 479\u2013480.)\n      Relying on Ceballos, Morales argues that the evidence that he\nwas resisting McMillian\u2019s attempt to rob him was itself a sufficient\nbasis for his requested instruction without regard to any danger of\ngreat bodily injury or death. Morales notes that CALCRIM No. 505,\nbased on Ceballos, provides bracketed language in the first element of\nthe self-defense instruction to allow a jury to find that element is\nsatisfied if a defendant reasonably believed the defendant was in\nimminent danger of death, great bodily injury, or being raped, maimed,\nor robbed. CALCRIM No. 505 further states in a bench note, \u201cIf the\ndefendant is asserting that he or she was resisting the commission of\n\n\n\n                                    14\n\fone of these felonies or another specific felony, the court should include\nthe bracketed language at the end of element 1 and select \u2018raped,\u2019\n\u2018maimed,\u2019 or \u2018robbed,\u2019 or insert another appropriate forcible and\natrocious crime. In all other cases involving death or great bodily\ninjury, the court should use element 1 without the bracketed language.\u201d\nMorales also cites People v. Young (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 641, 644,\nfn. 2, 650 (Young), which reversed a conviction because the trial court\nfailed to instruct the jury that homicide is justifiable when resisting an\nattempt to murder, commit a felony, or do great bodily injury.\n      Young and Ceballos notwithstanding, we are not convinced that a\nmere robbery, without more, will give rise to the right of self-defense\nwith deadly force. Young predated Ceballos and its restriction of\nsection 197 to forcible and atrocious felonies, so it is not helpful. Using\nCeballos\u2019 terminology, we conclude that robberies are not always\nforcible and atrocious, as they cover a wide scope of conduct. \u201cRobbery\nis the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of\nanother, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will,\naccomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d (\u00a7 211.) But the degree of\nforce involved is immaterial, and can be satisfied by wresting a purse\nfrom someone unwilling to part with it and stepping on her foot (People\nv. Burns (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1259), or even by politely\ntapping a person on the shoulder to indicate that she should step aside\nfrom a cash register (People v. Garcia (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1242,\n1246, disapproved of on other grounds by People v. Mosby (2004)\n33 Cal.4th 353). Where a robbery is accomplished through fear,\nmeanwhile, the fear need not pertain to physical safety at all and can\nbe a fear of injury to property. (\u00a7 212.) A robbery therefore cannot\n\n\n\n                                    15\n\ftrigger the right to use deadly force in self-defense unless the\ncircumstances of the robbery gave rise to a reasonable belief that the\nvictim would suffer great bodily injury or death. To be sure, many\nrobberies likely satisfy that standard, since, for example, a victim who\nsurrenders property in response to the brandishing of a weapon or what\nappears to be a deadly weapon could reasonably fear that the robber\nwould use it. (See, e.g., People v. Villa (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1429,\n1433 [pointing a metallic object that appeared to be a gun induced fear\nin victims and satisfied the fear element of robbery].) But the\ntouchstone for self-defense remains the reasonable belief of the danger\nof great bodily injury or death, not the threat of a robbery in and of\nitself.\n          Ceballos\u2019 remark that robbery is a forcible and atrocious crime\ndoes not convince us otherwise. Ceballos itself did not involve a\nrobbery, so the remark is dicta. Further, treating all robberies as\nforcible and atrocious crimes would be at odds with Ceballos\u2019 approach\nof examining whether the character and manner of the burglary at\nissue there threatened or could be reasonably believed to threaten\ndeath or serious bodily harm. (Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at p. 479.)\nThe corresponding instruction in another set of jury instructions,\nCALJIC Crim. 5.16, also states that robbery is a forcible and atrocious\ncrime, based on Ceballos. But as the use note for that instruction\nexplains, Ceballos \u201crelied upon an old Alabama case and an 1899\nevidence text, and those authors obviously had in mind the traditional\ncommon law robbery. Since Ceballos, other cases have expanded\nrobbery to include situations where very little force or threat of force is\ninvolved. In addition, some unarmed robberies would not meet the\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fdefinition of forcible and atrocious. Bearing in mind that in Ceballos,\nthe court was postulating a rule of reasonableness, it is suggested that\nif the trial court is in doubt whether the crime the victim was engaged\nin was in fact forcible and atrocious, using the first paragraph of the\ninstruction alone [concerning the threat of great bodily injury or death]\nwould permit the jury to determine appropriately the merits of the\nalleged defense.\u201d\n      The suggestion in this use note is sensible. As the court\nremarked in People v. Jones, supra, 191 Cal.App.2d at page 482 (on\nwhich Ceballos relied), \u201cAny civilized system of law recognizes the\nsupreme value of human life, and excuses or justifies its taking only in\ncases of apparent absolute necessity.\u201d For that reason, to determine\nwhether a person who fears being the victim of a crime may respond\nwith deadly force, \u201c[w]e must look further into the character of the\ncrime, and the manner of its perpetration,\u201d prohibiting the use of\ndeadly force when the character and manner of the crime \u201cdo not\nreasonably create a fear of great bodily harm.\u201d (Ibid.) The use of\ndeadly force is not necessary to prevent a robbery that is little more\nthan a purse snatching or to prevent harm to the purse. Neither the\nLegislature nor Ceballos can have intended to permit the victim of a\nrobbery to use deadly force in such situations.\n      In his reply brief, Morales advances a narrower argument that\nhis requested robbery instruction was necessary for the jury\u2019s\nunderstanding of the case because robbery can be accomplished by\ninstilling fear of bodily injury and that was the basis for his claim of\nself-defense. He believes the jury could not put these points together,\nbecause it was only told that Morales could resist an imminent attack,\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\fnot that he could use force to defend himself if he believed he was\nhaving property taken by use of fear of physical attack. His maintains\nthe jury should have been told how the fear of great bodily injury in the\ncontext of a robbery applied to the concept of self-defense.\n      This argument has no more merit than Morales\u2019 first position.\nPreliminarily, this theory does not match the instruction Morales\nrequested in the trial court, which presented fear of robbery as an\nalternative basis for self-defense to fear of great bodily injury or death,\nnot as a contributing factor to the fear of great bodily injury or death.\nMore importantly, the jury did not need to be instructed on self-defense\nin the context of a robbery. Because the trial court told the jury that\nMorales could use deadly force in self-defense if he reasonably feared\nan imminent attack that might result in death or great bodily injury, it\nwas unnecessary to go further and say he could use deadly force in self-\ndefense if he reasonably feared such an imminent attack as part of a\nrobbery. The instruction the trial court delivered thus necessarily\nencompassed the theory Morales advanced. The key question for the\npurposes of self-defense is not an attacker\u2019s motive for attacking, but\nthe sincerity and reasonableness of Morales\u2019 belief of an imminent\nattack. \u201cIn determining whether error has been committed in giving\njury instructions, we consider the instructions as a whole and assume\njurors are intelligent persons, capable of understanding and correlating\nall jury instructions which are given. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cInstructions should\nbe interpreted, if possible, so as to support the judgment rather than\ndefeat it if they are reasonably susceptible to such interpretation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Barber, supra, 55 Cal.App.5th at pp. 798\u2013799.) Considering\n\n\n\n\n                                    18\n\fthe instructions as a whole, the jury could evaluate Morales\u2019 theory\nusing the instructions the trial court provided.\n       Even if the trial court should have provided an instruction on the\nnarrow theory that Morales advances in his reply brief, the error was\nharmless under either the federal or state standards. (People v.\nGonzalez (2018) 5 Cal.5th 186, 199 [California Supreme Court has \u201cyet\nto determine whether a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on a requested\naffirmative defense instruction supported by substantial evidence is\nfederal constitutional error or state law error\u201d]; People v. Barber, supra,\n55 Cal.App.5th at p. 799 [error in refusing to give a requested pinpoint\ninstruction is reviewed under People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818,\n836].) As Morales admits, his defense focused on making the robbery a\npart of the basis for Morales\u2019 claim of fear. He raised the robbery and\nhis resulting fear numerous times in his testimony. His counsel raised\nthe robbery theory several times in closing argument as well. The jury\nnonetheless chose to convict Morales of second degree murder. This\nindicates that the jury did not accept Morales\u2019 claims that he used\ndeadly force because of a genuine and reasonable fear that McMillian\nwould inflict great bodily injury or kill him. Adding an additional\ninstruction that Morales could have acted in self-defense if he had a\nfear of great bodily injury or death due to robbery would not have\nchanged the jury\u2019s finding on this point.\nIII.   Instruction on imperfect self-defense\n       Morales next challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction on voluntary\nmanslaughter based on imperfect self-defense.4 In addition to\n\n\n\n       Morales did not object to this instruction below, but we may\n       4\n\nreview his argument here that the instruction was an incorrect\n\n                                    19\n\finstructing the jury on self-defense in accordance with CALCRIM\nNo. 505, the trial court instructed the jury using CALCRIM No. 571.\nThat instruction states that a killing that would otherwise be murder is\nreduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant kills because of\nimperfect self-defense. It further states that a defendant acts in\nimperfect self-defense if a defendant (1) actually believes that he or she\nis in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury\nand (2) actually believes that the immediate use of deadly force is\nnecessary to defend against the danger, but (3) at least one of those\nbeliefs is unreasonable.\n      Morales contends this instruction was insufficient because it\nfailed to tell the jury that a homicide also qualifies as voluntary\nmanslaughter and not murder when a defendant\u2019s beliefs in danger and\nthe need to use deadly force are reasonable but the sort of deadly force\nhe uses is excessive and more than necessary to repel the attack. He\nargues that if the jury found he reasonably believed he would suffer\ngreat bodily injury from McMillian in the course of the robbery and\nreasonably believed he needed to arm himself against McMillian, but\nfound that stabbing McMillian in the abdomen was more force than\nwas reasonably necessary, the jury could find him guilty of voluntary\nmanslaughter.\n      Our Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cnot every unreasonable\nbelief will support a claim of imperfect self-defense\u201d; rather, a\n\n\n\nstatement of the law if the instruction affected his substantial rights,\nmeaning it was reversible error under People v. Watson, supra,\n46 Cal.2d at p. 836. (\u00a7 1259; People v. Christopher (2006)\n137 Cal.App.4th 418, 427; People v. Rivera (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 141,\n146.)\n\n                                    20\n\fdefendant can claim imperfect self-defense based only on a belief \u201cthat,\nif reasonable, would support a claim of perfect self-defense.\u201d (People v.\nValencia (2008) 43 Cal.4th 268, 288.) For example, if a defendant\nunreasonably believes someone is going to punch him in the arm and\nstabs him to death in response, \u201cthis belief would not support a claim of\nimperfect self-defense for the reason that the belief, even if reasonable,\nwould not permit the use of deadly force.\u201d (Id. at p. 288, fn. 6.) In such\na scenario, the use of force would be excessive but still would not reduce\na homicide to voluntary manslaughter. Similarly here, if Morales\nreasonably believed he needed to use force against McMillian but used\nmore force than was necessary, then he could not claim perfect self-\ndefense. As a result, he cannot claim imperfect self-defense, either.\n      Moreover, Morales does not explain how his stabbing could be\nbased on his reasonable belief in the need to use of deadly force but still\nqualify as excessive.5 If Morales reasonably believed he needed to use\ndeadly force to prevent McMillian from harming him, his use of a single\nstab with his knife would appear to be reasonable. (Cf. Young, supra,\n214 Cal.App.2d at pp. 649\u2013650 [deadly force would be excessive if\ndefendant chased victim as victim ran away from fight and stabbed him\nafter he was lying on the ground].) Morales also cites no authority for\nhis position that one type of deadly force could be reasonable but\n\n\n      5To the extent Morales is making the related argument that the\ninstructions failed to inform the jury that he would be guilty only of\nvoluntary manslaughter if he had a sincere, but unreasonable, belief in\nthe need to use deadly force, we reject this claim as well. The\ninstructions informed the jury of precisely this point, and in any event,\nif Morales\u2019 sincere belief in the need to use deadly force was\nunreasonable, then by definition the use of deadly force would be\nexcessive.\n\n                                    21\n\fanother could be excessive. The relevant consideration is whether a\ndefendant uses more force than is necessary to repel an attack, not the\ntype of deadly force used by a defendant. (See People v. Hardin (2000)\n85 Cal.App.4th 625, 629\u2013630.)\n      Morales further argues that the trial court should have\ninstructed the jury that malice would be negated if they found that\nMorales killed out of an honest belief in the need to defend himself but\nused excessive force.. Morales is correct that imperfect self-defense\nconverts a homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter because it\nnegates the element of malice. (People v. Mayfield, (1997) 14 Cal.4th\n668, 777\u2013778, abrogated on other grounds by People v. Scott (2015)\n61 Cal.4th 363, 390, fn. 2.) But the negation of malice is immaterial for\nthe purposes of the jury. Mayfield did not hold, as Morales contends,\nthat the jury necessarily had to be instructed on how imperfect self-\ndefense impacts the concept of malice. (Ibid.) Although the instruction\nin Mayfield did explain that imperfect self-defense negated malice,\nMayfield found the instruction there sufficient because it made clear\nthat the question of whether an imperfect self-defense theory will\npreclude a murder conviction turns on the jury\u2019s assessment of whether\nthe defendant\u2019s belief in the need to use deadly force was sincere, even\nif unreasonable. (Ibid.) So, too, the instruction here.\n      People v. Genovese (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 817, 832, rejected the\nargument Morales now advances. Like Morales, Genovese contended\nthat the jury instructions erroneously failed to inform the jury that\nimperfect self-defense eliminates malice. (Id. at p. 825.) The court held\nthat \u201cit does not matter that the [] instructions failed to inform the jury\nthat imperfect defense of another would eliminate malice,\u201d explaining\n\n\n\n                                    22\n\fthat Genovese\u2019s \u201cargument is defeated by the plain language of the\ninstructions as given to the jury, that \u2018[a] killing that would otherwise\nbe murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter\u2019 if defendant acted in\nimperfect defense.\u201d (Id. at pp. 830\u2013831, 832.) As a result, it was\n\u201cimmaterial that the jury was not informed that, in fact, what was\ngoing on was that the jury was finding an \u2018absence of malice.\u2019 . . . The\ndefinition of malice may be interesting to lawyers and judges and law\nprofessors, but it does not aid the task of lay jurors to inform them that,\nwhen the defendant acts in an honest but unreasonable belief in the\nneed to defend another, he is acting without malice.\u201d (Id. at p. 831.)\nThe jury in Morales\u2019 trial received the same instruction. Like the\nGenovese court, we find that this instruction adequately explained that\nMorales would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he acted in\nimperfect self-defense, even if the jury found he had an intent to kill or\na conscious disregard for the danger of his actions. (Ibid.) We presume\nthe jury followed this instruction, despite not being told the underlying\nlegal rationale that the reduction of murder to voluntary manslaughter\nwould occur via the mechanism of negating malice. (People v. Barber,\nsupra, 55 Cal.App.5th at p. 799 [\u201c \u2018The crucial assumption underlying\nour constitutional system of trial by jury is that jurors generally\nunderstand and faithfully follow instructions\u2019 \u201d].)\nIV.   Failure to instruct on voluntary intoxication\n      Morales finally argues the trial court should have delivered an\ninstruction on voluntary intoxication. In the context of second degree\nmurder, evidence of a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication can negate a\nfinding that he harbored express malice, which is defined in section 188\nas an intent to kill unlawfully. (People v. Turk, supra, 164 Cal.App.4th\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\fat pp. 1376\u20131378; \u00a7 29.4, subd. (b); see People v. Soto (2018) 4 Cal.5th\n968, 975.) However, voluntary intoxication cannot negate a finding of\nimplied malice. (Turk, at p. 1376 [\u201ca defendant who unlawfully kills\nwithout express malice due to voluntary intoxication can still act with\nimplied malice, which voluntary intoxication cannot negate\u201d]; Soto, at\np. 977 [\u201cBy prohibiting evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate\nimplied malice, the Legislature apparently [intended] that a defendant\nwho acts with conscious disregard for life should be punished for\nmurder regardless of whether voluntary intoxication impaired his or\nher judgment\u201d]; \u00a7 29.4, subds. (a)\u2013(b).) A defendant is therefore\nentitled to an instruction on voluntary intoxication \u201conly when there is\nsubstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication and the\nintoxication affected the defendant\u2019s \u2018actual formation of specific\nintent.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 677.) \u201cIn\ndetermining whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a jury\ninstruction, the trial court does not determine the credibility of the\ndefense evidence, but only whether \u2018there was evidence which, if\nbelieved by the jury, was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Salas (2006) 37 Cal.4th 967, 982.)\n      Morales asked the court to deliver CALCRIM No. 625, which\ndefines voluntary intoxication and as relevant here states that a jury\nmay consider voluntary intoxication for the limited purpose of deciding\nwhether a defendant acted with the intent to kill. The trial court\ndenied Morales\u2019 request, stating, \u201cNo one touched upon that. No one\neven asked him about -- you know, you have the doctor talk about the\nmethamphetamine issue and then how within six hours it would\nprocess itself. It hadn\u2019t processed itself. So it\u2019s within the window, but\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\fnobody talked about that. Nobody asked that question. So that\u2019s the\nquestion. I\u2019m sitting here waiting and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n      We agree with the trial court that the evidence here was\ninsufficient to warrant an instruction on voluntary intoxication.\nMorales focuses on the testimony of the pathologist that Morales\u2019 blood\ntested positive for methamphetamine and the absence of metabolites\nwas \u201cconsistent with an acute intoxication.\u201d The pathologist testified\nthat these lab results indicated that Morales had recently taken the\nmethamphetamine, somewhere between 1 and 12 hours prior to his\nblood being drawn. The pathologist also explained that\nmethamphetamine can cause agitation, sweating, high blood pressure,\n\u201ceven a certain level of psychosis, confusion, aggression on some levels.\u201d\nAdditionally, the pathologist mentioned that cocaine and\nmethamphetamine can both cause excited delirium.\n      What is missing from this general testimony about the effects of\nmethamphetamine, however, is any indication that Morales\u2019 use of\nmethamphetamine affected his thought process in any way. This\nabsence is conspicuous, because, as the trial judge noted, Morales\u2019\ncounsel\u2019s questioning of the pathologist initially suggested that he\nintended to present a defense of voluntary intoxication. But Morales\u2019\ncounsel never completed the defense by presenting evidence regarding\nthe effects of methamphetamine on Morales\u2019 formation of an intent to\nkill, either from the pathologist or Morales himself. Morales\u2019 counsel\nhimself seemed to recognize this, since he described the testimony on\nvoluntary intoxication as \u201climited\u201d when he asked for the instruction.\nFor example, Morales\u2019 counsel never asked the pathologist which of the\neffects of methamphetamine Morales would have exhibited given the\n\n\n\n                                   25\n\famount found in his blood, or whether any of the described effects\nwould have prevented Morales from forming the intent to kill. Morales\u2019\ncounsel focused his questions to the pathologist on excited delirium as\nit relates to McMillian\u2019s use of cocaine and did not try to link excited\ndelirium to the level of methamphetamine in Morales\u2019 blood. Besides,\nthe pathologist also made clear that excited delirium cannot be\ndiagnosed from a toxicology report alone, but instead is diagnosed\nbased on a description of a person\u2019s conduct. Morales himself never\nmentioned using methamphetamine or raised any issue with respect to\nwhether the methamphetamine affected his formation of an intent to\nkill McMillian. Absent such evidence, the pathologist\u2019s testimony\nregarding the amount of methamphetamine in Morales\u2019 blood and the\ngeneral effects of methamphetamine was not sufficient to raise a\nreasonable doubt in the jury\u2019s mind about Morales\u2019 intent to kill.\n(People v. Salas, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 982.)\n      This case is similar in this regard to People v. Williams, supra,\n16 Cal.4th 635. Williams held that even if a few isolated references to\na defendant being \u201c \u2018spaced out,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018doped up,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018smokin\u2019 pretty\ntough\u2019 \u201d qualified as evidence that the defendant was intoxicated at the\ntime of the crime, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s\nrequest for a voluntary intoxication instruction because \u201cthere was no\nevidence at all that voluntary intoxication had any effect on [the]\ndefendant\u2019s ability to formulate intent.\u201d (Id. at pp. 677\u2013678.) Similarly\nhere, even if the pathologist\u2019s testimony could qualify as substantial\nevidence that Morales was intoxicated, in the absence of evidence that\nhis intoxication had any effect on his formation of the intent to kill, the\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\ftrial court correctly refused his request for an instruction on the effects\nof voluntary intoxication.\n      In a fallback argument, Morales argues that any insufficiency of\nthe evidence to support a voluntary intoxication instruction\ndemonstrates his trial counsel was constitutionally insufficient. He\ncontends that Morales\u2019 counsel\u2019s questioning of the pathologist and\nrequest for the instruction indicates that his counsel intended to lay the\nfoundation for a voluntary intoxication defense, so that his failure to\nelicit the necessary testimony fell below reasonable professional\nstandards.\n      \u201cTo demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, [Morales] \u2018must\nshow that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficiency\nprejudiced the defense.\u2019 [Citation.] On direct appeal, a finding of\ndeficient performance is warranted where \u2018(1) the record affirmatively\ndiscloses counsel had no rational tactical purpose for the challenged act\nor omission, (2) counsel was asked for a reason and failed to provide\none, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory explanation.\u2019\n[Citation.] \u2018[W]here counsel\u2019s trial tactics or strategic reasons for\nchallenged decisions do not appear on the record, we will not find\nineffective assistance of counsel on appeal unless there could be no\nconceivable reason for counsel\u2019s acts or omissions.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Johnsen\n(2021) 10 Cal.5th 1116, 1165.)\n      We cannot say in this direct appeal that Morales\u2019 trial counsel\nwas ineffective for failing to elicit the final piece of testimony regarding\nMorales\u2019 intoxication. Despite asking for the instruction at the end of\ntrial, his counsel could have rationally decided earlier that it was better\nnot to rely on Morales\u2019 use of methamphetamine for his defense.\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fMorales\u2019 counsel\u2019s admission that the evidence regarding voluntary\nintoxication was limited suggests this was in fact a tactical decision.\nEvidence of voluntary intoxication at most would have defeated a\nfinding that he acted with express malice. The jury could still have\nconvicted Morales based on a finding of implied malice. The evidence\nat trial supported an implied malice theory, since the jury could have\nconcluded that thrusting a seven-inch knife towards McMillian\u2019s\nabdomen demonstrated Morales had a conscious disregard for\nMcMillian\u2019s life, even if Morales did not actually intend to take his life.\nMorales\u2019 counsel could have reasonably concluded that the benefit from\nrelying on Morales\u2019 methamphetamine use to defeat a finding of\nexpress malice was not worth the risk of losing the sympathy of the\njury and thereby making a conviction based on an implied malice\ntheory more likely.6\n                              DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                            BROWN, J.\n\nI CONCUR:\n\nTUCHER, J.\uf02a\nPeople v. Morales (A159825)\n\n\n\n\n       6Because we find the trial court committed no error, we need not\nconsider Morales\u2019 contention that the cumulative effects of multiple\nerrors in his trial made it fundamentally unfair in violation of due\nprocess.\n       \uf02a\n        Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate\nDistrict, Division Three, sitting by assignment pursuant to article VI,\nsection 6 of the California Constitution.\n\n                                    28\n\fSTREETER, Acting P. J., Concurring.\n      I agree with the lead opinion that the imminent danger of\nrobbery Morales faced was not sufficient to warrant his requested\npinpoint instruction on self-defense, but I am reluctant to reject his\nclaimed entitlement to that instruction as categorically as my\ncolleagues do. In support of his claim of error, Morales does not suggest\nthat \u201call robberies\u201d ought to be treated as forcible and atrocious felonies\nas a matter of law, so I see no need to expound on whether the\nillustrative reference to robbery in People v. Ceballos (1974) 12 Cal.3d\n470, 478, was dicta or not. We should tread carefully in dealing with\nwhat may appear to be statements extraneous to the precise holding of\na Supreme Court case. (Hubbard v. Superior Court (1997)\n66 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1169 [\u201c \u2018Even if properly characterized as dictum,\nstatements of the Supreme Court should be considered persuasive.\u2019 \u201d].)\nWhat Morales contends is that, on this record, there was substantial\nevidence to support his proposed instruction. We need go no further\nthan to answer that question on the specific facts of this case.\n      The felony-resistance defense contained in Penal Code\nsection 197, subdivision (1), is a codification of the traditional common\nlaw felony-resistance defense. (People v. Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at\npp. 477\u2013478; People v. Jones (1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 478, 481.) Where\nstatutes are merely codifications of the common law, we must assume\nthey are limited by the corresponding traditional common law rules.\n(Parsley v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 934, 938\u2013939.) Virtually all\nforms of the common law doctrine of justification contain an element of\nobjective reasonableness. (People v. Uriarte (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 192,\n197; see generally Note, Justification for the Use of Force in the\n\n\n\n                                     1\n\fCriminal Law (1961) 13 Stan. L.Rev. 566.) An objective reasonableness\nrequirement is therefore implied in the statutory version of the defense\nMorales proposed as the frame for his requested pinpoint instruction.\n      There is a subjective element to the defense as well. Felony-\nresistance is not available as an excuse or justification unless the\ndefendant actually and reasonably believes in the need to use deadly\nforce. \u201cA homicide is considered justified as self-defense where the\ndefendant actually and reasonably believed the use of deadly force was\nnecessary to defend himself from imminent threat of death or great\nbodily injury. Under such circumstances, the killing is not a crime.\n[Citations] Where the defendant kills while actually but unreasonably\nbelieving the use of deadly force was necessary, defendant is considered\nto have acted in imperfect self-defense. Imperfect self-defense is not a\ncomplete defense to a killing, but negates the malice element and\nreduces the offense to voluntary manslaughter. [Citations.] \u2018The\nsubjective elements of self-defense and imperfect self-defense are\nidentical. Under each theory, the [defendant] must actually believe in\nthe need to defend . . . against imminent peril to life or great bodily\ninjury.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Sotelo-Urena (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 732, 744.)\n      Drawing inferences from the record in favor of Morales, he was\nan indigent person carrying all of his possessions in his backpack and\nhe attempted to ward off an attempt to strip him by force of everything\nhe owned. None of us has ever been in that situation, but in applying\nthe requisite test of actually perceived peril and reasonableness, we\nmust make an effort to put ourselves in the shoes of someone reacting\nto a threat so profound that it struck at the victim\u2019s fundamental sense\nof personal security. (Cf. People v. Humphrey (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1073,\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\f1083 [in a homicide case involving an attempt to present expert\ntestimony supporting a battered women\u2019s syndrome claim of self-\ndefense, \u201c[a]lthough the ultimate test of reasonableness is objective, in\ndetermining whether a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would\nhave believed in the need to defend, the jury must consider all of the\nrelevant circumstances in which a defendant found herself.\u201d].) For a\nperson so impoverished that he owns nothing else, there could be\ncircumstances in which a threatened taking of property meets this test.\n      Even looking at things in this case through that prism, on these\nspecific facts I conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the\nrequested pinpoint instruction. It does not appear to me that Morales\neither actually or reasonably believed that the taking of his backpack\nwas such a serious threat to his person that deadly force was necessary\nto repel it. I can imagine additional circumstances showing that\nMorales, acting out of the sense of desperate hypervigilance that life on\nthe streets sometimes engenders, might have perceived extreme danger\nwhere others accustomed to greater personal security would not. (See\nPeople v. Sotelo-Urena, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at pp. 745\u2013746 [reversing\nfirst degree murder conviction based on erroneous refusal to allow\ntestimony from expert who was prepared to explain \u201cthat individuals\nwho are chronically homeless . . . are subjected to a high rate of\nviolence by both housed and homeless individuals, and that the\nexperience of living for years on the streets instills a perpetual fear of\nviolence that would have affected defendant\u2019s belief in the need to\ndefend himself with lethal force\u201d].) But no such circumstances were\nshown here.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f      The mental-state defense in this case, put on through an expert,\nwas that Morales, a former gang member who had cut his ties with his\nformer gang associates and who had been beaten and attacked multiple\ntimes for doing so, suffered from severe posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) that was easily triggered by perceived threats. Due to his past\nentanglement with gang life, he was, in short, a person with a hair-\ntrigger for violence when he came under threat. That has nothing to do\nwith some deep sense of attachment to his belongings. Other than his\ngang past, there is very little in the record about Morales\u2019s life\ncircumstances at the time of the crime.

Ct. No. 18CR019843)\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n        A jury convicted Anthony Morales of second degree murder for\nstabbing Eric McMillian outside a Greyhound station in Oakland.\nMorales contends the evidence was insufficient to support his\nconviction. He also argues the trial court erred by improperly\ninstructing the jury on self-defense and imperfect self-defense and\ndenying an instruction on voluntary intoxication. We disagree and\nshall affirm.\n                            BACKGROUND\n        In his youth in Watsonville, Morales had associated with gang\nmembers. He later distanced himself from the gang and, as a result,\ngang members had assaulted him and stabbed him twice. Morales\ntestified against a gang member related to one of the stabbings and in\nexchange was placed in a witness protection program in Oregon.\n        One day in December 2018, Morales was in Oakland waiting for a\nGreyhound bus to visit his family. His only luggage was a backpack\nthat contained, among other things, a seven and a half inch kitchen\n\n\n                                     1\n\fknife. Morales also had a butterfly knife in his pocket. Morales carried\nthe weapons for self-defense.\n      Morales arrived in Oakland at noon. When he tried to board a\nbus in the afternoon, Morales got into a fight with the bus station staff.\nMorales had persisted in trying to get on the wrong bus despite the\nstaff telling him he had the wrong ticket. The police arrived in\nresponse to a call and spoke to Morales, but they took no action because\nthe security guard did not want to press charges.\n      Morales testified that he kept his backpack on his shoulder\nunless he was inside, because he didn\u2019t want anyone to take his\nbelongings while he was at the station. However, the Greyhound\nstation\u2019s security cameras showed that around 8:30 p.m. he stood on\nthe sidewalk in front of the station for at least five minutes with his\nbackpack at his feet.\n      Later that night, around 9:00 p.m., Morales left the station with\nan unidentified man wearing a beanie hat and walked along the\nsidewalk towards the parking lot on the side of the building. Morales\ntestified that the two went to the parking lot so Morales could smoke a\ncigarette and the other man could use a vape with marijuana. The\nGreyhound station\u2019s video security cameras captured the two men\nwalking on the sidewalk in front of the building, but the area of the\nparking lot where the men stood was not visible to the security\ncameras.\n      Less than 15 seconds after arriving at the parking lot, the man\nwith the hat returned to the sidewalk in front of the bus station, while\nMorales stayed on the side of the building. Thirty seconds after that,\nMcMillian walked by and stepped around the corner of the building\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\finto the parking lot out of view of the camera. McMillian was wearing\nshorts, a coat, and a red hoodie. McMillian usually carried a backpack\nor bag of some sort when he left his apartment, but at this point he was\ncarrying only a bicycle wheel.\n      According to Morales, McMillian was taller and bigger than he.\nMcMillian asked Morales for a cigarette. Morales responded that he\ndid not have another but offered to give McMillian some change.\nMcMillian seemed to take offense to Morales\u2019 offer of change and said,\n\u201cIf I want your shit, I\u2019ll take your shit.\u201d Feeling threatened, Morales\nsaid McMillian could not take any of Morales\u2019 possessions, and Morales\ntook a step backward and turned to get away. As he was turning,\nMorales felt McMillian\u2019s fingers rake across his shoulder and pull on\nhis backpack. The force pulled Morales back around, and he saw that\nMcMillian was now holding his backpack. Morales also felt McMillian\nbrush against him, so Morales pushed McMillian.\n      Morales testified that he then backed out of the parking lot onto\nthe sidewalk at the corner of the station and McMillian walked toward\nhim. The security camera captured Morales as he backed onto the\nsidewalk without his backpack, about 40 seconds after McMillian\nstepped off the sidewalk into the parking lot. Morales said he walked\nback towards McMillian and demanded his backpack, then backed\naway again when McMillian did not return it.\n      According to Morales, McMillian then said, \u201cWhat else you got?\u201d\nBelieving McMillian was trying to take his cell phone and wallet,\nMorales lifted his shirt to reveal a knife in the waistband of his pants.\nMorales drew the knife, held it with the blade against his forearm, and\nraised his arm across his chest. Morales leaned back, and it seemed to\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\fhim that McMillian was moving closer to take the knife, so Morales\nsaid he lashed out by extending his arm straight. Based on a later\nautopsy, Morales drove his knife five and a half inches into McMillian\u2019s\ntorso.\n         At the time of the stabbing, the two men were on the edge of the\nvideo taken from the security camera and the details of the scene are\nsomewhat difficult to make out. The video does not show Morales\nlifting his shirt and it is difficult to tell when he drew the knife. But\nthe video does show that less than 15 seconds after Morales backed\nonto the sidewalk, he stepped forward toward McMillian and, in a\nbackhanded motion, stabbed at McMillian with a knife. McMillian\u2019s\narms were at his sides. Morales admitted that McMillian never drew a\nweapon, did not verbally threaten him, and never took a swing at him.\n         According to Morales, after stabbing McMillian he tried to get his\nbackpack, but McMillian walked towards him swinging punches.\nMcMillian fell down, got back up, picked up the backpack and bicycle\nwheel, and started swinging the wheel at Morales to keep Morales\naway. McMillian then walked quickly away, and Morales did not\npursue him. These interactions were mostly out of view of the security\ncamera, though the video reflects portions of them. Raymond Price,\nwho had exited the building and witnessed some of these interactions\nafter the stabbing, testified that Morales appeared to be the aggressor\nattacking McMillian, while McMillian was saying \u201cHey, man,\u201d\nshielding himself, and trying to get away.\n         McMillian walked from the parking lot to his nearby apartment\nbuilding, dripping blood on the sidewalk. With blood pouring out from\nhis shirt, he asked the front desk clerk to call 911. He asked another\n\n\n\n                                      4\n\fresident of the building to take the bicycle wheel and Morales\u2019\nbackpack up to the resident\u2019s room. While waiting for first responders,\nMcMillian said he had been robbed by a Mexican. McMillian was then\ntaken to the hospital where he died from his injuries.\n      Morales meanwhile dropped his knife at the corner of the parking\nlot. Morales then ran away from the sidewalk, alongside the building,\nthrough the parking lot. He testified that he ran to get the security\nguard at the bus loading area in the back of the building but turned\nback in the parking lot when he encountered a plastic fence blocking\nthe bus loading area. The cameras show him running through the\nparking lot alongside the building and turning back, but they do not\nshow any fence. Morales then smoked a cigarette in the front of the\nbuilding and went inside. The police detained Morales at the bus\nstation shortly afterwards.\n      The autopsy showed that McMillian\u2019s blood tested positive for\ncocaine, methadone, and a very low level of marijuana, as well as\nmetabolites of those substances. The pathologist explained that cocaine\ncan cause agitation, alertness, increased heart rate and blood pressure,\nand sweating. The cocaine level in McMillian\u2019s blood was significant\nbut not necessarily fatal, especially because the presence of significant\namounts of cocaine metabolite suggested he was a chronic user. For\nthe same reason, McMillian may have had more of a tolerance and not\nbeen exhibiting the effects of cocaine as acutely as someone who had\nnever used the drug before. The stab wound in McMillian\u2019s abdomen\npenetrated his stomach and liver and was the cause of his death.\nMcMillian had abrasions on his knees consistent with falling on\nconcrete. McMillian also had a superficial cut on the side of his thumb\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\ftowards the end from the knuckle, which could have been caused by\nhim trying to grab a knife but was more likely a defensive wound.\n      Morales had blood drawn at the police station, and his blood\ntested positive for methamphetamine and an antidepressant drug but\nnot amphetamine. The effects of methamphetamine are similar to\ncocaine and include agitation, sweating, high blood pressure, as well as\nsome level of psychosis, confusion, and aggression. The pathologist\nstated that methamphetamine is metabolized to amphetamine between\n1 and 12 hours after use, so the amount of methamphetamine in\nMorales\u2019 blood without any amphetamine was consistent with acute\nintoxication and indicated the methamphetamine had been recently\ntaken.\n      The pathologist told the jury that both cocaine and\nmethamphetamine can cause a condition called excited delirium.\nExcited delirium consists of excitement or agitation like a fight or flight\nreaction, and people with the condition will get agitated and can be\nphysically violent against things or people. People experiencing excited\ndelirium are also not responding appropriately to stimuli and may not\nunderstand instructions, may make growling or unintelligible sounds,\nand fight in an aggressive, desperate way with superhuman strength.\nThe state may end in exhaustion or death. The aggression of a person\nin excited delirium can arise because the person has paranoia and\nthinks people are coming after them. Although the levels of cocaine in\nMcMillian\u2019s blood were consistent with a state of excited delirium,\nwithout a description of McMillian\u2019s behavior, they were not sufficient\nfor the pathologist to say whether they caused McMillian to be in a\nstate of excited delirium.\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f      A psychologist, Dr. Laeeq Evered, testified for the defense that\nMorales had significant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from his\nprior experiences with gangs and being stabbed. Dr. Evered opined\nthat if a person with significant PTSD were robbed in the dark in a\nstrange place, the event would be likely to trigger a fear response of\nfreeze, then fight or flight. A person with such a response would\ntypically have poor memory of the details of the incident, and as a\nresult might make up a story to explain the incident, perhaps by\nwatching a video of the incident, while believing the confabulated\nmemory to be true. Dr. Evered admitted that people with PTSD do not\nalways have a fear response to triggering events and that it was hard\nto know whether a person was acting out of a fear-based PTSD\nresponse or deciding to stab someone. Dr. Evered also acknowledged\nthat people with PTSD can get angry and act for reasons other than a\nfear response.\n      After a trial in July 2019, the jury found Morales not guilty of\nfirst degree murder but could not reach a verdict regarding second\ndegree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary\nmanslaughter. The trial court declared a mistrial. After a second trial\nin December 2019, the jury deliberated for about 17 hours over four\ndays before finding Morales guilty of second degree murder and finding\ntrue the allegation that he used a knife. The trial court sentenced\nMorales to 16 years to life in prison.\n                              DISCUSSION\n I.   Sufficiency of the evidence\n      Morales contends the evidence was not sufficient to support his\nconviction for second degree murder. \u201cSecond degree murder is the\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\funlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, but\nwithout the premeditation, deliberation and willfulness necessary to\nelevate the offense to first degree murder.\u201d (People v.

The Supreme Court has \u201cinterpreted implied malice as\nhaving \u2018both a physical and a mental component. The physical\ncomponent is satisfied by the performance of \u201can act, the natural\nconsequences of which are dangerous to life.\u201d [Citation.] The mental\ncomponent is the requirement that the defendant \u201cknows that his\nconduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious\ndisregard for life.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v.

In his reply brief, however,\nMorales abandons the first argument by conceding that the evidence\nthat he struck first and used a knife to stab at McMillian\u2019s abdomen,\namong other things, supports a finding that he intended to kill. He\nnonetheless insists this evidence was insufficient under his third\nargument because the evidence shows his mental state was impacted\nby a fear of McMillian\u2019s robbery.\n      As the Attorney General points out, however, the jury was free to\ndisbelieve Morales\u2019 claim that he was afraid and acting in self-defense,\nespecially in light of the evidence to the contrary. (People v. Webb\n(1978) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">83 Cal.App.3d 83</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94\u201395.) Morales admitted that he lashed out\nat McMillian with a seven-inch knife with sufficient force to penetrate\nfive and a half inches into McMillian\u2019s abdomen. Price testified that\nimmediately after the stabbing Morales was the aggressor and\nMcMillian was trying to get away. The pathologist testified that\nMcMillian had a defensive wound on his thumb. The jury also saw the\nvideo of the stabbing, which shows that Morales wound up for his\nkilling stroke by leaning back and then stepped forward to McMillian,\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\fpurposefully driving his knife straight towards McMillian\u2019s abdomen.\nDuring the moments immediately preceding the stabbing, McMillian\ndid not appear to be menacing or threatening Morales, and McMillian\u2019s\narms never left his sides. The jury had a sufficient basis from which to\nconclude Morales intended to kill and was not acting in self-defense or\nimperfect self-defense.2\n      Morales\u2019 argument regarding implied malice and his PTSD\nevidence likewise falls short. Morales points out that Dr. Evered\u2019s\ntestimony that Morales suffered from PTSD was undisputed. Dr.\nEvered told the jury that if Morales were experiencing a fear response\ntriggered by his PTSD, Morales would have been unable to consciously\nconsider the risk to McMillian\u2019s life from Morales\u2019 actions. Morales\nargues no reasonable jury could conclude from this evidence that\nMorales was aware that his actions were dangerous and consciously\ndisregarded the risk.3\n      Morales cites no authority for his apparent assumption that the\njury was required to accept Dr. Evered\u2019s testimony about Morales\u2019\nPTSD. Such an assumption is contrary to the instruction to the jury,\n\n\n\n      2 Morales argues the jury verdict cannot be construed as a\nrejection of his claim of self-defense because of his separate argument\nthat the jury was not properly instructed that self-defense applies in\ncases of robbery. We reject this claim of instructional error for the\nreasons set out below.\n      3 Morales also mentions the evidence of his methamphetamine\nintoxication in support of his argument regarding implied malice. But\nas we discuss in further detail below in response to Morales\u2019 argument\nregarding his request for an instruction on voluntary intoxication,\nevidence of voluntary intoxication cannot be used to disprove implied\nmalice.

Assuming the jury did believe Dr.\nEvered\u2019s testimony on these points, the jury could still decide that\nMorales had implied malice despite the PTSD diagnosis. Dr. Evered\nadmitted that people with PTSD can act for reasons other than their\nPTSD, even in triggering situations. The jury could watch the video of\nMorales\u2019 actions and conclude from Morales\u2019 behavior and actions on\nthe video that he was not acting based on fear or PTSD at the time of\nthe stabbing, despite his and Dr. Evered\u2019s testimony to the contrary.\nWe cannot gainsay the jury\u2019s conclusion in this regard.\nII.   Instruction on self-defense to robbery\n      \u201cWe review a claim of instructional error de novo. [Citation.]\n\u2018Review of the adequacy of instructions is based on whether the trial\ncourt \u201cfully and fairly instructed on the applicable law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v.\nBarber (2020) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">55 Cal.App.5th 787</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 798.) \u201cGenerally, the trial court is\nrequired to instruct the jury on the general principles of law that are\nclosely and openly connected with the evidence and that are necessary\nto the jury\u2019s understanding of the case. [Citation.] It also has a duty to\nrefrain from giving incorrect instructions or instructions on principles\nof law that are irrelevant and that would have the effect of confusing\nthe jury or relieving it from making findings on the relevant issues.\u201d\n(Id. at p. 799.)\n      The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with CALCRIM\nNo. 505 that Morales acted in lawful self-defense if (1) he reasonably\n\n\n\n                                    12\n\fbelieved that he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering\ngreat bodily injury, (2) he reasonably believed that the immediate use\nof deadly force was necessary to defend against that danger, and (3) he\nused no more force than was reasonably necessary. Morales asked the\ntrial court to modify the first element to include, apart from the\nimminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury, an\nimminent danger of being robbed or maimed. The trial court denied\nMorales\u2019 requested instruction, telling Morales\u2019 counsel that he could\ndiscuss robbery in his argument concerning the concepts of danger of\ngreat bodily injury or death, but that the danger had to be one of\nimminent death or great bodily injury.\n      Morales contends the trial court erred by denying his request to\nadd an imminent danger of robbery as a sufficient basis for the first\nelement of self-defense because his own testimony provided ample\nevidence that McMillian was committing a robbery. He argues the trial\ncourt mistakenly believed that self-defense was available only to\nrespond to a danger of great bodily injury or death. He relies primarily\non section 197, as construed in People v. Ceballos (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal.3d 470</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Ceballos).\n      Section 197 provides that homicide is justifiable \u201c[w]hen resisting\nany attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some\ngreat bodily injury upon any person\u201d or \u201c[w]hen committed in defense of\nhabitation, property, or person, against one who manifestly intends or\nendeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony.\u201d (\u00a7 197,\nsubds.

Jones (1961)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">191 Cal.App.2d 478</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481\u2013482, Ceballos therefore read section 197 as\npermitting the use of deadly force to prevent a felony only if the felony\nis \u201cforcible and atrocious.\u201d (Ceballos, at p. 478.) Ceballos then\nremarked, \u201cExamples of forcible and atrocious crimes are murder,\nmayhem, rape and robbery. (See Storey v. State [(1882)] </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">71 Ala. 329</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n340; 3 Greenleaf on Evidence (1899) p. 122.) In such crimes \u2018from their\natrocity and violence human life [(]or personal safety from great\nharm[)] either is, or is presumed to be, in peril.\u2019 \u201d (Ceballos, at pp. 478\u2013\n479.) Ceballos went on to hold that even though burglary had also been\nconsidered a forcible and atrocious crime, because burglary had a wide\nscope, not all burglaries would trigger the right to use deadly force in\nself-defense. (Id. at p. 479.) Ceballos therefore held that a defendant\nwho killed two burglars with a trap gun, when the defendant was not\non the property when it was burglarized, could not claim self-defense.\n(Id. at pp. 479\u2013480.)\n      Relying on Ceballos, Morales argues that the evidence that he\nwas resisting McMillian\u2019s attempt to rob him was itself a sufficient\nbasis for his requested instruction without regard to any danger of\ngreat bodily injury or death. Morales notes that CALCRIM No. 505,\nbased on Ceballos, provides bracketed language in the first element of\nthe self-defense instruction to allow a jury to find that element is\nsatisfied if a defendant reasonably believed the defendant was in\nimminent danger of death, great bodily injury, or being raped, maimed,\nor robbed. CALCRIM No. 505 further states in a bench note, \u201cIf the\ndefendant is asserting that he or she was resisting the commission of\n\n\n\n                                    14\n\fone of these felonies or another specific felony, the court should include\nthe bracketed language at the end of element 1 and select \u2018raped,\u2019\n\u2018maimed,\u2019 or \u2018robbed,\u2019 or insert another appropriate forcible and\natrocious crime. In all other cases involving death or great bodily\ninjury, the court should use element 1 without the bracketed language.\u201d\nMorales also cites People v. Young (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">214 Cal.App.2d 641</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644,\nfn. 2, 650 (Young), which reversed a conviction because the trial court\nfailed to instruct the jury that homicide is justifiable when resisting an\nattempt to murder, commit a felony, or do great bodily injury.\n      Young and Ceballos notwithstanding, we are not convinced that a\nmere robbery, without more, will give rise to the right of self-defense\nwith deadly force. Young predated Ceballos and its restriction of\nsection 197 to forcible and atrocious felonies, so it is not helpful. Using\nCeballos\u2019 terminology, we conclude that robberies are not always\nforcible and atrocious, as they cover a wide scope of conduct. \u201cRobbery\nis the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of\nanother, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will,\naccomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d (\u00a7 211.) But the degree of\nforce involved is immaterial, and can be satisfied by wresting a purse\nfrom someone unwilling to part with it and stepping on her foot (People\nv. Burns (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">172 Cal.App.4th 1251</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1259), or even by politely\ntapping a person on the shoulder to indicate that she should step aside\nfrom a cash register (People v. Garcia (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">45 Cal.App.4th 1242</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1246, disapproved of on other grounds by People v. Mosby (2004)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521459\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521459/people-v-mosby/\">33 Cal.4th 353</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">). Where a robbery is accomplished through fear,\nmeanwhile, the fear need not pertain to physical safety at all and can\nbe a fear of injury to property. (\u00a7 212.) A robbery therefore cannot\n\n\n\n                                    15\n\ftrigger the right to use deadly force in self-defense unless the\ncircumstances of the robbery gave rise to a reasonable belief that the\nvictim would suffer great bodily injury or death. To be sure, many\nrobberies likely satisfy that standard, since, for example, a victim who\nsurrenders property in response to the brandishing of a weapon or what\nappears to be a deadly weapon could reasonably fear that the robber\nwould use it. (See, e.g., People v. Villa (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">157 Cal.App.4th 1429</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1433 [pointing a metallic object that appeared to be a gun induced fear\nin victims and satisfied the fear element of robbery].) But the\ntouchstone for self-defense remains the reasonable belief of the danger\nof great bodily injury or death, not the threat of a robbery in and of\nitself.\n          Ceballos\u2019 remark that robbery is a forcible and atrocious crime\ndoes not convince us otherwise. Ceballos itself did not involve a\nrobbery, so the remark is dicta. Further, treating all robberies as\nforcible and atrocious crimes would be at odds with Ceballos\u2019 approach\nof examining whether the character and manner of the burglary at\nissue there threatened or could be reasonably believed to threaten\ndeath or serious bodily harm. (Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at p. 479.)\nThe corresponding instruction in another set of jury instructions,\nCALJIC Crim. 5.16, also states that robbery is a forcible and atrocious\ncrime, based on Ceballos. But as the use note for that instruction\nexplains, Ceballos \u201crelied upon an old Alabama case and an 1899\nevidence text, and those authors obviously had in mind the traditional\ncommon law robbery. Since Ceballos, other cases have expanded\nrobbery to include situations where very little force or threat of force is\ninvolved. In addition, some unarmed robberies would not meet the\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fdefinition of forcible and atrocious. Bearing in mind that in Ceballos,\nthe court was postulating a rule of reasonableness, it is suggested that\nif the trial court is in doubt whether the crime the victim was engaged\nin was in fact forcible and atrocious, using the first paragraph of the\ninstruction alone [concerning the threat of great bodily injury or death]\nwould permit the jury to determine appropriately the merits of the\nalleged defense.\u201d\n      The suggestion in this use note is sensible. As the court\nremarked in People v. Jones, supra, 191 Cal.App.2d at page 482 (on\nwhich Ceballos relied), \u201cAny civilized system of law recognizes the\nsupreme value of human life, and excuses or justifies its taking only in\ncases of apparent absolute necessity.\u201d For that reason, to determine\nwhether a person who fears being the victim of a crime may respond\nwith deadly force, \u201c[w]e must look further into the character of the\ncrime, and the manner of its perpetration,\u201d prohibiting the use of\ndeadly force when the character and manner of the crime \u201cdo not\nreasonably create a fear of great bodily harm.\u201d (Ibid.) The use of\ndeadly force is not necessary to prevent a robbery that is little more\nthan a purse snatching or to prevent harm to the purse. Neither the\nLegislature nor Ceballos can have intended to permit the victim of a\nrobbery to use deadly force in such situations.\n      In his reply brief, Morales advances a narrower argument that\nhis requested robbery instruction was necessary for the jury\u2019s\nunderstanding of the case because robbery can be accomplished by\ninstilling fear of bodily injury and that was the basis for his claim of\nself-defense. He believes the jury could not put these points together,\nbecause it was only told that Morales could resist an imminent attack,\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\fnot that he could use force to defend himself if he believed he was\nhaving property taken by use of fear of physical attack. His maintains\nthe jury should have been told how the fear of great bodily injury in the\ncontext of a robbery applied to the concept of self-defense.\n      This argument has no more merit than Morales\u2019 first position.\nPreliminarily, this theory does not match the instruction Morales\nrequested in the trial court, which presented fear of robbery as an\nalternative basis for self-defense to fear of great bodily injury or death,\nnot as a contributing factor to the fear of great bodily injury or death.\nMore importantly, the jury did not need to be instructed on self-defense\nin the context of a robbery. Because the trial court told the jury that\nMorales could use deadly force in self-defense if he reasonably feared\nan imminent attack that might result in death or great bodily injury, it\nwas unnecessary to go further and say he could use deadly force in self-\ndefense if he reasonably feared such an imminent attack as part of a\nrobbery. The instruction the trial court delivered thus necessarily\nencompassed the theory Morales advanced. The key question for the\npurposes of self-defense is not an attacker\u2019s motive for attacking, but\nthe sincerity and reasonableness of Morales\u2019 belief of an imminent\nattack. \u201cIn determining whether error has been committed in giving\njury instructions, we consider the instructions as a whole and assume\njurors are intelligent persons, capable of understanding and correlating\nall jury instructions which are given. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cInstructions should\nbe interpreted, if possible, so as to support the judgment rather than\ndefeat it if they are reasonably susceptible to such interpretation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Barber, supra, 55 Cal.App.5th at pp. 798\u2013799.) Considering\n\n\n\n\n                                    18\n\fthe instructions as a whole, the jury could evaluate Morales\u2019 theory\nusing the instructions the trial court provided.\n       Even if the trial court should have provided an instruction on the\nnarrow theory that Morales advances in his reply brief, the error was\nharmless under either the federal or state standards. (People v.\nGonzalez (2018) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">5 Cal.5th 186</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 [California Supreme Court has \u201cyet\nto determine whether a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on a requested\naffirmative defense instruction supported by substantial evidence is\nfederal constitutional error or state law error\u201d]; People v. Barber, supra,\n55 Cal.App.5th at p. 799 [error in refusing to give a requested pinpoint\ninstruction is reviewed under People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">46 Cal.2d 818</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n836].) As Morales admits, his defense focused on making the robbery a\npart of the basis for Morales\u2019 claim of fear. He raised the robbery and\nhis resulting fear numerous times in his testimony. His counsel raised\nthe robbery theory several times in closing argument as well. The jury\nnonetheless chose to convict Morales of second degree murder. This\nindicates that the jury did not accept Morales\u2019 claims that he used\ndeadly force because of a genuine and reasonable fear that McMillian\nwould inflict great bodily injury or kill him. Adding an additional\ninstruction that Morales could have acted in self-defense if he had a\nfear of great bodily injury or death due to robbery would not have\nchanged the jury\u2019s finding on this point.\nIII.   Instruction on imperfect self-defense\n       Morales next challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction on voluntary\nmanslaughter based on imperfect self-defense.4 In addition to\n\n\n\n       Morales did not object to this instruction below, but we may\n       4\n\nreview his argument here that the instruction was an incorrect\n\n                                    19\n\finstructing the jury on self-defense in accordance with CALCRIM\nNo. 505, the trial court instructed the jury using CALCRIM No. 571.\nThat instruction states that a killing that would otherwise be murder is\nreduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant kills because of\nimperfect self-defense. It further states that a defendant acts in\nimperfect self-defense if a defendant (1) actually believes that he or she\nis in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury\nand (2) actually believes that the immediate use of deadly force is\nnecessary to defend against the danger, but (3) at least one of those\nbeliefs is unreasonable.\n      Morales contends this instruction was insufficient because it\nfailed to tell the jury that a homicide also qualifies as voluntary\nmanslaughter and not murder when a defendant\u2019s beliefs in danger and\nthe need to use deadly force are reasonable but the sort of deadly force\nhe uses is excessive and more than necessary to repel the attack. He\nargues that if the jury found he reasonably believed he would suffer\ngreat bodily injury from McMillian in the course of the robbery and\nreasonably believed he needed to arm himself against McMillian, but\nfound that stabbing McMillian in the abdomen was more force than\nwas reasonably necessary, the jury could find him guilty of voluntary\nmanslaughter.\n      Our Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cnot every unreasonable\nbelief will support a claim of imperfect self-defense\u201d; rather, a\n\n\n\nstatement of the law if the instruction affected his substantial rights,\nmeaning it was reversible error under People v. Watson, supra,\n46 Cal.2d at p. 836. (\u00a7 1259; People v. Christopher (2006)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">137 Cal.App.4th 418</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427; People v. Rivera (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">162 Cal.App.3d 141</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n146.)\n\n                                    20\n\fdefendant can claim imperfect self-defense based only on a belief \u201cthat,\nif reasonable, would support a claim of perfect self-defense.\u201d (People v.\nValencia (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634308\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634308/people-v-valencia/\">43 Cal.4th 268</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288.) For example, if a defendant\nunreasonably believes someone is going to punch him in the arm and\nstabs him to death in response, \u201cthis belief would not support a claim of\nimperfect self-defense for the reason that the belief, even if reasonable,\nwould not permit the use of deadly force.\u201d (Id. at p. 288, fn. 6.) In such\na scenario, the use of force would be excessive but still would not reduce\na homicide to voluntary manslaughter. Similarly here, if Morales\nreasonably believed he needed to use force against McMillian but used\nmore force than was necessary, then he could not claim perfect self-\ndefense. As a result, he cannot claim imperfect self-defense, either.\n      Moreover, Morales does not explain how his stabbing could be\nbased on his reasonable belief in the need to use of deadly force but still\nqualify as excessive.5 If Morales reasonably believed he needed to use\ndeadly force to prevent McMillian from harming him, his use of a single\nstab with his knife would appear to be reasonable. (Cf. Young, supra,\n214 Cal.App.2d at pp. 649\u2013650 [deadly force would be excessive if\ndefendant chased victim as victim ran away from fight and stabbed him\nafter he was lying on the ground].) Morales also cites no authority for\nhis position that one type of deadly force could be reasonable but\n\n\n      5To the extent Morales is making the related argument that the\ninstructions failed to inform the jury that he would be guilty only of\nvoluntary manslaughter if he had a sincere, but unreasonable, belief in\nthe need to use deadly force, we reject this claim as well. The\ninstructions informed the jury of precisely this point, and in any event,\nif Morales\u2019 sincere belief in the need to use deadly force was\nunreasonable, then by definition the use of deadly force would be\nexcessive.\n\n                                    21\n\fanother could be excessive. The relevant consideration is whether a\ndefendant uses more force than is necessary to repel an attack, not the\ntype of deadly force used by a defendant. (See People v. Hardin (2000)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">85 Cal.App.4th 625</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 629\u2013630.)\n      Morales further argues that the trial court should have\ninstructed the jury that malice would be negated if they found that\nMorales killed out of an honest belief in the need to defend himself but\nused excessive force.. Morales is correct that imperfect self-defense\nconverts a homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter because it\nnegates the element of malice. (People v. Mayfield, (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">14 Cal.4th\n668</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777\u2013778, abrogated on other grounds by People v. Scott (2015)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">61 Cal.4th 363</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390, fn. 2.) But the negation of malice is immaterial for\nthe purposes of the jury. Mayfield did not hold, as Morales contends,\nthat the jury necessarily had to be instructed on how imperfect self-\ndefense impacts the concept of malice. (Ibid.) Although the instruction\nin Mayfield did explain that imperfect self-defense negated malice,\nMayfield found the instruction there sufficient because it made clear\nthat the question of whether an imperfect self-defense theory will\npreclude a murder conviction turns on the jury\u2019s assessment of whether\nthe defendant\u2019s belief in the need to use deadly force was sincere, even\nif unreasonable. (Ibid.) So, too, the instruction here.\n      People v. Genovese (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">168 Cal.App.4th 817</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832, rejected the\nargument Morales now advances. Like Morales, Genovese contended\nthat the jury instructions erroneously failed to inform the jury that\nimperfect self-defense eliminates malice. (Id. at p. 825.) The court held\nthat \u201cit does not matter that the [] instructions failed to inform the jury\nthat imperfect defense of another would eliminate malice,\u201d explaining\n\n\n\n                                    22\n\fthat Genovese\u2019s \u201cargument is defeated by the plain language of the\ninstructions as given to the jury, that \u2018[a] killing that would otherwise\nbe murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter\u2019 if defendant acted in\nimperfect defense.\u201d (Id. at pp. 830\u2013831, 832.) As a result, it was\n\u201cimmaterial that the jury was not informed that, in fact, what was\ngoing on was that the jury was finding an \u2018absence of malice.\u2019 . . . The\ndefinition of malice may be interesting to lawyers and judges and law\nprofessors, but it does not aid the task of lay jurors to inform them that,\nwhen the defendant acts in an honest but unreasonable belief in the\nneed to defend another, he is acting without malice.\u201d (Id. at p. 831.)\nThe jury in Morales\u2019 trial received the same instruction. Like the\nGenovese court, we find that this instruction adequately explained that\nMorales would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he acted in\nimperfect self-defense, even if the jury found he had an intent to kill or\na conscious disregard for the danger of his actions. (Ibid.) We presume\nthe jury followed this instruction, despite not being told the underlying\nlegal rationale that the reduction of murder to voluntary manslaughter\nwould occur via the mechanism of negating malice. (People v. Barber,\nsupra, 55 Cal.App.5th at p. 799 [\u201c \u2018The crucial assumption underlying\nour constitutional system of trial by jury is that jurors generally\nunderstand and faithfully follow instructions\u2019 \u201d].)\nIV.   Failure to instruct on voluntary intoxication\n      Morales finally argues the trial court should have delivered an\ninstruction on voluntary intoxication. In the context of second degree\nmurder, evidence of a defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication can negate a\nfinding that he harbored express malice, which is defined in section 188\nas an intent to kill unlawfully. (People v. Turk, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">164 Cal.App.4th\n\n\n\n                                    23</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fat pp. 1376\u20131378; \u00a7 29.4, subd. (b); see People v. Soto (2018) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.5th\n968</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975.) However, voluntary intoxication cannot negate a finding of\nimplied malice. (Turk, at p. 1376 [\u201ca defendant who unlawfully kills\nwithout express malice due to voluntary intoxication can still act with\nimplied malice, which voluntary intoxication cannot negate\u201d]; Soto, at\np. 977 [\u201cBy prohibiting evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate\nimplied malice, the Legislature apparently [intended] that a defendant\nwho acts with conscious disregard for life should be punished for\nmurder regardless of whether voluntary intoxication impaired his or\nher judgment\u201d]; \u00a7 29.4, subds. (a)\u2013(b).) A defendant is therefore\nentitled to an instruction on voluntary intoxication \u201conly when there is\nsubstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication and the\nintoxication affected the defendant\u2019s \u2018actual formation of specific\nintent.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Williams (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">16 Cal.4th 635</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677.) \u201cIn\ndetermining whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a jury\ninstruction, the trial court does not determine the credibility of the\ndefense evidence, but only whether \u2018there was evidence which, if\nbelieved by the jury, was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Salas (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510587/people-v-salas/\">37 Cal.4th 967</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 982.)\n      Morales asked the court to deliver CALCRIM No. 625, which\ndefines voluntary intoxication and as relevant here states that a jury\nmay consider voluntary intoxication for the limited purpose of deciding\nwhether a defendant acted with the intent to kill. The trial court\ndenied Morales\u2019 request, stating, \u201cNo one touched upon that. No one\neven asked him about -- you know, you have the doctor talk about the\nmethamphetamine issue and then how within six hours it would\nprocess itself. It hadn\u2019t processed itself. So it\u2019s within the window, but\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\fnobody talked about that. Nobody asked that question. So that\u2019s the\nquestion. I\u2019m sitting here waiting and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n      We agree with the trial court that the evidence here was\ninsufficient to warrant an instruction on voluntary intoxication.\nMorales focuses on the testimony of the pathologist that Morales\u2019 blood\ntested positive for methamphetamine and the absence of metabolites\nwas \u201cconsistent with an acute intoxication.\u201d The pathologist testified\nthat these lab results indicated that Morales had recently taken the\nmethamphetamine, somewhere between 1 and 12 hours prior to his\nblood being drawn. The pathologist also explained that\nmethamphetamine can cause agitation, sweating, high blood pressure,\n\u201ceven a certain level of psychosis, confusion, aggression on some levels.\u201d\nAdditionally, the pathologist mentioned that cocaine and\nmethamphetamine can both cause excited delirium.\n      What is missing from this general testimony about the effects of\nmethamphetamine, however, is any indication that Morales\u2019 use of\nmethamphetamine affected his thought process in any way. This\nabsence is conspicuous, because, as the trial judge noted, Morales\u2019\ncounsel\u2019s questioning of the pathologist initially suggested that he\nintended to present a defense of voluntary intoxication. But Morales\u2019\ncounsel never completed the defense by presenting evidence regarding\nthe effects of methamphetamine on Morales\u2019 formation of an intent to\nkill, either from the pathologist or Morales himself. Morales\u2019 counsel\nhimself seemed to recognize this, since he described the testimony on\nvoluntary intoxication as \u201climited\u201d when he asked for the instruction.\nFor example, Morales\u2019 counsel never asked the pathologist which of the\neffects of methamphetamine Morales would have exhibited given the\n\n\n\n                                   25\n\famount found in his blood, or whether any of the described effects\nwould have prevented Morales from forming the intent to kill. Morales\u2019\ncounsel focused his questions to the pathologist on excited delirium as\nit relates to McMillian\u2019s use of cocaine and did not try to link excited\ndelirium to the level of methamphetamine in Morales\u2019 blood. Besides,\nthe pathologist also made clear that excited delirium cannot be\ndiagnosed from a toxicology report alone, but instead is diagnosed\nbased on a description of a person\u2019s conduct. Morales himself never\nmentioned using methamphetamine or raised any issue with respect to\nwhether the methamphetamine affected his formation of an intent to\nkill McMillian. Absent such evidence, the pathologist\u2019s testimony\nregarding the amount of methamphetamine in Morales\u2019 blood and the\ngeneral effects of methamphetamine was not sufficient to raise a\nreasonable doubt in the jury\u2019s mind about Morales\u2019 intent to kill.\n(People v. Salas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510587/people-v-salas/\">supra, 37</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Cal.4th at p. 982.)\n      This case is similar in this regard to People v.

Williams held that even if a few isolated references to\na defendant being \u201c \u2018spaced out,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018doped up,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018smokin\u2019 pretty\ntough\u2019 \u201d qualified as evidence that the defendant was intoxicated at the\ntime of the crime, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s\nrequest for a voluntary intoxication instruction because \u201cthere was no\nevidence at all that voluntary intoxication had any effect on [the]\ndefendant\u2019s ability to formulate intent.\u201d (Id. at pp. 677\u2013678.) Similarly\nhere, even if the pathologist\u2019s testimony could qualify as substantial\nevidence that Morales was intoxicated, in the absence of evidence that\nhis intoxication had any effect on his formation of the intent to kill, the\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\ftrial court correctly refused his request for an instruction on the effects\nof voluntary intoxication.\n      In a fallback argument, Morales argues that any insufficiency of\nthe evidence to support a voluntary intoxication instruction\ndemonstrates his trial counsel was constitutionally insufficient. He\ncontends that Morales\u2019 counsel\u2019s questioning of the pathologist and\nrequest for the instruction indicates that his counsel intended to lay the\nfoundation for a voluntary intoxication defense, so that his failure to\nelicit the necessary testimony fell below reasonable professional\nstandards.\n      \u201cTo demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, [Morales] \u2018must\nshow that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficiency\nprejudiced the defense.\u2019 [Citation.] On direct appeal, a finding of\ndeficient performance is warranted where \u2018(1) the record affirmatively\ndiscloses counsel had no rational tactical purpose for the challenged act\nor omission, (2) counsel was asked for a reason and failed to provide\none, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory explanation.\u2019\n[Citation.] \u2018[W]here counsel\u2019s trial tactics or strategic reasons for\nchallenged decisions do not appear on the record, we will not find\nineffective assistance of counsel on appeal unless there could be no\nconceivable reason for counsel\u2019s acts or omissions.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Johnsen\n(2021) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">10 Cal.5th 1116</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1165.)\n      We cannot say in this direct appeal that Morales\u2019 trial counsel\nwas ineffective for failing to elicit the final piece of testimony regarding\nMorales\u2019 intoxication. Despite asking for the instruction at the end of\ntrial, his counsel could have rationally decided earlier that it was better\nnot to rely on Morales\u2019 use of methamphetamine for his defense.\n\n\n\n                                     27\n\fMorales\u2019 counsel\u2019s admission that the evidence regarding voluntary\nintoxication was limited suggests this was in fact a tactical decision.\nEvidence of voluntary intoxication at most would have defeated a\nfinding that he acted with express malice. The jury could still have\nconvicted Morales based on a finding of implied malice. The evidence\nat trial supported an implied malice theory, since the jury could have\nconcluded that thrusting a seven-inch knife towards McMillian\u2019s\nabdomen demonstrated Morales had a conscious disregard for\nMcMillian\u2019s life, even if Morales did not actually intend to take his life.\nMorales\u2019 counsel could have reasonably concluded that the benefit from\nrelying on Morales\u2019 methamphetamine use to defeat a finding of\nexpress malice was not worth the risk of losing the sympathy of the\njury and thereby making a conviction based on an implied malice\ntheory more likely.6\n                              DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                            BROWN, J.\n\nI CONCUR:\n\nTUCHER, J.\uf02a\nPeople v.

In support of his claim of error, Morales does not suggest\nthat \u201call robberies\u201d ought to be treated as forcible and atrocious felonies\nas a matter of law, so I see no need to expound on whether the\nillustrative reference to robbery in People v. Ceballos (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">12 Cal.3d\n470</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478, was dicta or not. We should tread carefully in dealing with\nwhat may appear to be statements extraneous to the precise holding of\na Supreme Court case. (Hubbard v. Superior Court (1997)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">66 Cal.App.4th 1163</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169 [\u201c \u2018Even if properly characterized as dictum,\nstatements of the Supreme Court should be considered persuasive.\u2019 \u201d].)\nWhat Morales contends is that, on this record, there was substantial\nevidence to support his proposed instruction. We need go no further\nthan to answer that question on the specific facts of this case.\n      The felony-resistance defense contained in Penal Code\nsection 197, subdivision (1), is a codification of the traditional common\nlaw felony-resistance defense. (People v. Ceballos, supra, 12 Cal.3d at\npp. 477\u2013478; People v. Jones (1961) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">191 Cal.App.2d 478</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481.) Where\nstatutes are merely codifications of the common law, we must assume\nthey are limited by the corresponding traditional common law rules.\n(Parsley v. Superior Court (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">9 Cal.3d 934</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938\u2013939.) Virtually all\nforms of the common law doctrine of justification contain an element of\nobjective reasonableness. (People v. Uriarte (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">223 Cal.App.3d 192</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n197; see generally Note, Justification for the Use of Force in the\n\n\n\n                                     1\n\fCriminal Law (1961) 13 Stan. L.Rev. 566.) An objective reasonableness\nrequirement is therefore implied in the statutory version of the defense\nMorales proposed as the frame for his requested pinpoint instruction.\n      There is a subjective element to the defense as well. Felony-\nresistance is not available as an excuse or justification unless the\ndefendant actually and reasonably believes in the need to use deadly\nforce. \u201cA homicide is considered justified as self-defense where the\ndefendant actually and reasonably believed the use of deadly force was\nnecessary to defend himself from imminent threat of death or great\nbodily injury. Under such circumstances, the killing is not a crime.\n[Citations] Where the defendant kills while actually but unreasonably\nbelieving the use of deadly force was necessary, defendant is considered\nto have acted in imperfect self-defense. Imperfect self-defense is not a\ncomplete defense to a killing, but negates the malice element and\nreduces the offense to voluntary manslaughter. [Citations.] \u2018The\nsubjective elements of self-defense and imperfect self-defense are\nidentical. Under each theory, the [defendant] must actually believe in\nthe need to defend . . . against imminent peril to life or great bodily\ninjury.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Sotelo-Urena (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">4 Cal.App.5th 732</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744.)\n      Drawing inferences from the record in favor of Morales, he was\nan indigent person carrying all of his possessions in his backpack and\nhe attempted to ward off an attempt to strip him by force of everything\nhe owned. None of us has ever been in that situation, but in applying\nthe requisite test of actually perceived peril and reasonableness, we\nmust make an effort to put ourselves in the shoes of someone reacting\nto a threat so profound that it struck at the victim\u2019s fundamental sense\nof personal security. (Cf. People v. Humphrey (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119473\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119473/people-v-humphrey/\">13 Cal.4th 1073</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\f1083 [in a homicide case involving an attempt to present expert\ntestimony supporting a battered women\u2019s syndrome claim of self-\ndefense, \u201c[a]lthough the ultimate test of reasonableness is objective, in\ndetermining whether a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would\nhave believed in the need to defend, the jury must consider all of the\nrelevant circumstances in which a defendant found herself.\u201d].) For a\nperson so impoverished that he owns nothing else, there could be\ncircumstances in which a threatened taking of property meets this test.\n      Even looking at things in this case through that prism, on these\nspecific facts I conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the\nrequested pinpoint instruction. It does not appear to me that Morales\neither actually or reasonably believed that the taking of his backpack\nwas such a serious threat to his person that deadly force was necessary\nto repel it. I can imagine additional circumstances showing that\nMorales, acting out of the sense of desperate hypervigilance that life on\nthe streets sometimes engenders, might have perceived extreme danger\nwhere others accustomed to greater personal security would not. (See\nPeople v. Sotelo-Urena, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at pp. 745\u2013746 [reversing\nfirst degree murder conviction based on erroneous refusal to allow\ntestimony from expert who was prepared to explain \u201cthat individuals\nwho are chronically homeless . . . are subjected to a high rate of\nviolence by both housed and homeless individuals, and that the\nexperience of living for years on the streets instills a perpetual fear of\nviolence that would have affected defendant\u2019s belief in the need to\ndefend himself with lethal force\u201d].) But no such circumstances were\nshown here.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f      The mental-state defense in this case, put on through an expert,\nwas that Morales, a former gang member who had cut his ties with his\nformer gang associates and who had been beaten and attacked multiple\ntimes for doing so, suffered from severe posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) that was easily triggered by perceived threats. Due to his past\nentanglement with gang life, he was, in short, a person with a hair-\ntrigger for violence when he came under threat. That has nothing to do\nwith some deep sense of attachment to his belongings. Other than his\ngang past, there is very little in the record about Morales\u2019s life\ncircumstances at the time of the crime. He appears to have been an\nindigent drifter, and he testified that his backpack contained\neverything he had, including clothes and medications\u2014\u201call my stuff,\u201d\nas he put it\u2014but the focus of his defense was solely on his heightened\nsense of vulnerability to physical attack based on his gang history, not\non a concern about someone taking all of his \u201cstuff \u201d as a trigger for a\nPTSD-induced perpetual fear of violence.\n      On some other record, I would not rule out the possibility that\nthere could be a threatened robbery sufficiently serious to qualify as a\nforcible and atrocious felony, but we do not have that record here. With\nthis slight qualification, I concur fully in the opinion.\n                                             STREETER, Acting P.

The trial court granted\ndefendants\u2019 summary judgment motion in its entirety.\n        On appeal, plaintiff contends there are triable issues of fact as to two of his claims\nunder title 42 United States Code section 1983,1 whether Knox and Garrett committed an\nunexcused warrantless search that proximately caused his injuries and whether they used\nexcessive force in detaining him.

(Yanowitz v. L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36\nCal.4th 1028, 1037.) We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,\nthe party opposing summary judgment, resolving any doubts concerning the evidence in\nhis favor. (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n1   Further references to section 1983 are to title 42 of the United States Code.\n\n                                               2\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Property\n       Plaintiff, who was almost 66 years old at the time of this incident, lived at the end\nof Joint Road in Red Bluff, California.2 The maintained section of Joint Road, which\nwas a public highway, ended where it passed plaintiff\u2019s house. The county posted a sign\nreading \u201cRoad Closed\u201d at that point, and plaintiff strung a rope across the road to prevent\npeople from driving onto the closed portion of Joint Road.\n       Formation of the Officers\u2019 Operation\n       A real estate agent and his client moved plaintiff\u2019s rope to drive past the Road\nClosed sign to look for property. Plaintiff told them the road was closed. The client told\nthe agent he thought plaintiff had a handgun in his pocket. The agent called the\nDepartment to discuss the incident and to confirm that he had a legal right to use the road.\nThe agent did not specifically recall telling anyone at the Department what the client had\ntold him about the handgun, but he said he may have done so.\n       Hencratt shared with Knox his belief that plaintiff was a convicted felon who was\nprohibited from owning firearms, and he directed Knox to investigate. Knox and Garrett\nresearched plaintiff\u2019s criminal record using a database maintained by the California\nDepartment of Justice and discovered that plaintiff was a convicted felon, which they\nbelieved precluded him from owning, possessing, or controlling firearms. Based on his\nresearch, it also appeared to Garrett that Joint Road was a public roadway and not\nplaintiff\u2019s private property.\n       Knox did not interview the real estate agent or his client; the client later explained\nthat he had \u201cseen something\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s hand, \u201cpossibly a gun,\u201d but that it \u201ccould be\nanything.\u201d The client acknowledged he was at least 100 feet away, had bad eyesight, and\njust assumed that \u201cfor somebody to live somewhere in the country, they have to have a\n\n\n\n2 Plaintiff asserted that his property is in an unincorporated portion of Tehama County.\nThis dispute is not relevant to our analysis.\n\n                                              3\n\fgun.\u201d Knox and Garrett did not obtain a warrant to search plaintiff\u2019s property; Knox\nacknowledged they did not have probable cause to secure a warrant at that time.\n         The Operation\n         Knox and Garrett drove an unmarked sports utility vehicle (SUV) to Joint Road\nnear plaintiff\u2019s property. They dressed in plain clothes in order to conceal their identity\nas law enforcement officers; they intended to provoke plaintiff into brandishing a firearm.\n         Garrett walked toward the Road Closed sign. Plaintiff walked out onto his deck\nfrom inside his house, and he told Knox and Garrett that the road was closed and they\nwould be trespassing if they proceeded. Garrett returned to the SUV, and plaintiff went\nback inside his house. Garrett then walked to the rope, stepped over it, and continued\nonto the closed section of Joint Road. Knox and Garrett observed a chronograph on the\nnorth side of plaintiff\u2019s property, which they were aware can be used to measure bullet\nspeed.\n         Plaintiff left his house, walked through his shop located adjacent to his house to\nthe north, grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper, and approached the SUV to record its\nlicense plate number. Plaintiff then walked back to his deck, where he called 911 from a\nlandline.\n         Garrett and Knox decided to leave. They backed the SUV onto a driveway to the\nwest of plaintiff\u2019s shop; the driveway was on plaintiff\u2019s property but was used for public\npurposes, including package pickups and deliveries. The SUV was facing west, meaning\nthe driver\u2019s side door faced toward plaintiff, who stood on his porch to the south of his\nshop.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Observing the Firearm and the Takedown\n       Garrett then saw a bolt-action rifle on top of a bench on the north side of plaintiff\u2019s\nshop, and Knox saw the rifle after Garrett told him about it. The rifle was unloaded, and\nits bolt was back, meaning it was not in a position to be fired.3 There was no one near the\nrifle at the time Garrett observed it.\n       Knox and Garrett got out of the SUV, Knox from the driver\u2019s side. Garrett\ntestified that they did not try to obtain a warrant at that time because \u201cat this time we\nwere there, and we decided that we were going to attempt to make contact with [plaintiff]\nin regards to the rifle.\u201d In his deposition, Garrett was asked: \u201cAnd what was the\nemergency that allowed you to enter [plaintiff\u2019s] property without a warrant?\u201d Counsel\nobjected, and Garrett did not answer. Following the objection, Garrett was again asked,\n\u201cWas there an emergency?\u201d Garrett responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there was an\nemergency.\u201d4\n       While plaintiff stood talking to the 911 operator on his porch, Knox began\n\u201cwalking very quickly\u201d toward the back of plaintiff\u2019s shop, in the direction of the rifle.\n\n\n\n3  The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 objection to plaintiff\u2019s declaration providing\nmeasurements between the SUV and the rifle, and from where plaintiff stood to the rifle.\nPlaintiff contests this ruling on appeal and argues that witnesses are authorized to give\ntestimony estimating distances. But plaintiff asserted in his declaration that he later\nmeasured the distances, not that he was estimating. Because plaintiff did not provide a\nproper foundation for how or when he measured the distances, the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in sustaining the objection. (See Serri v. Santa Clara University\n(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 830, 852 [\u201cAccording to the weight of authority, appellate courts\n\u2018review the trial court's evidentiary rulings on summary judgment for abuse of\ndiscretion\u2019 \u201d].)\n4 The trial court overruled defendants\u2019 objection to this testimony, recognizing that\n\u201cthose words are in the deposition.\u201d But the court determined that Garrett\u2019s statement did\nnot refer to the time of the use of force, nor did it \u201ctend to prove an illegal search,\nexcessive force, nor to negate the claim of exigent circumstances.\u201d We discuss this\nruling, post.\n\n                                              5\n\fKnox did not identify himself as law enforcement as he moved toward the rifle. Plaintiff\nbelieved he was being robbed; he began running toward the rifle along the east side of the\nshop--the side facing away from the SUV.\n       When asked where Knox was at the time plaintiff started running toward the rifle,\nplaintiff testified that \u201c[Knox] was probably halfway around my shop by then,\u201d5 and was\n\u201cpast his vehicle.\u201d Plaintiff later photographed his view of the shop and driveway from\nhis porch, where he had stood while talking to the 911 operator. He was able to see\nthrough a large opening in the south wall of his shop to two windows in the shop\u2019s\nnorthwest corner. He had drawn a circle around the windows, and he testified he could\nsee \u201cKnox get out of his vehicle and start in a fast pace towards the back of my shop right\nhere (indicating).\u201d He then stated: \u201cAnd through these windows here where I could see\nhim half [sic].\u201d\n       After seeing plaintiff begin to run, Knox and then Garrett began running, still\nmoving toward the rifle.6 They observed what they believed to be ammunition near the\nrifle; they believed plaintiff could obtain and load the rifle, and they feared plaintiff\nmight fire it at them.\n       According to Karen Clendenen, plaintiff\u2019s girlfriend who witnessed the events,\nKnox exited the SUV, \u201cstarted to walk, and then he was walking pretty fast almost a\nrun.\u201d She recalled that as Knox began to run, \u201che pulled his jacket back, and I saw a\nbadge, so at that time I felt a little more comfortable knowing that he was law\nenforcement. And he took out his service revolver, whatever you call their guns, and he\n\n\n\n5 The trial court overruled defendants\u2019 objection to this statement; defendants do not\nchallenge this ruling.\n6 Plaintiff disputed this fact and asserted that Knox was already halfway to the gun\nbefore plaintiff began running. Plaintiff does not dispute that Knox began running\ntoward the rifle, as opposed to continuing to walk toward it, only after plaintiff began\nrunning toward the rifle from his location on the porch.\n\n                                               6\n\fheaded north and then east around the corner. And [plaintiff] came off the back porch.\nHe was standing on the back porch talking to 911 on the speaker phone because our\nreceiver doesn\u2019t work. And he ran off the porch around the barbecue and over to the\ncorner.\u201d\n       Knox reached the rifle before plaintiff, but he continued past it, turning the\nnortheast corner of the shop. As plaintiff approached the shop\u2019s northeast corner, Knox\ncame around the corner, aimed his service weapon at plaintiff\u2019s head from a distance of\neight or nine inches, and yelled, \u201cSheriff\u2019s office, get to the fucking ground, asshole.\u201d\nPlaintiff did not hear the words \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d He explained: \u201c[W]hen I seen that\ngun in front of my face, I didn\u2019t hear nothing. I was waiting to get shot. I was waiting to\ndie right there. And I thought I was going to get killed for somebody trying to steal from\nme.\u201d\n       Plaintiff started to back up so he could get on the ground. One to two seconds\nlater, Garrett tackled plaintiff to the ground from behind. Plaintiff went to the ground on\nhis front side and blocked his fall with his hands. His arms were pinned beneath his\nbody, and Knox and Garrett were yelling at him to give them his arms. Either Knox or\nGarrett shoved plaintiff\u2019s face into the ground. Both officers were on his back. They\ngrabbed plaintiff\u2019s arms, pulled them behind his back, and handcuffed him, leaving him\nlying face down in the dirt for \u201ca minute, minute and a half if not longer.\u201d Plaintiff\nrealized Knox and Garrett were law enforcement while he was on the ground being\nhandcuffed.\n       Plaintiff\u2019s Release and His Injuries\n       Plaintiff complained that his hands were hurting, and the handcuffs were too tight.\nThe officers informed him that he was a felon in possession of a firearm, but plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fasserted he had an expungement order he believed allowed him to possess rifles.7 Garrett\nmoved plaintiff from the ground to sitting on an ice chest next to the shop, loosening his\nhandcuffs after he repeatedly complained. Knox confirmed that plaintiff\u2019s conviction had\nbeen expunged. The officers removed plaintiff\u2019s handcuffs and left.\n       In his discovery responses, plaintiff asserted he experienced \u201c[n]ew right flank\npain, increased left knee pain, increased neck pain, increased lower back pain, and PTSD\n[posttraumatic stress disorder]\u201d as a result of the incident. In another response, he added\nthat he felt pain in his right lower rib cage area and right hip, and had experienced\nnightmares, nausea, and anxiety attacks. In response to defendants\u2019 separate statement of\nundisputed material facts, plaintiff agreed that he did not break any bones, and that as a\nresult of the incident, he claimed physical injuries of \u201c \u2018right flank pain\u2019 and an\nexacerbation of prior pain and injuries.\u201d\n       On appeal, plaintiff refers to his discovery responses, included in the record on\nsummary judgment, and asserts that Garrett\u2019s takedown injured his lower back, neck, hip,\nand knee and caused him to suffer from sleeplessness, nightmares, nausea, and anxiety.\nHe asserts he was prescribed medication and received medical treatment for both physical\nand psychological injuries. Defendants urge us to not consider this evidence; we address\nthat issue in our Discussion, post.\n       Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint\n       Plaintiff filed suit. His first amended complaint, which is the operative pleading,\nasserted causes of action against Knox, Garrett, Hencratt, and Tehama County. Plaintiff\nclaimed that all defendants violated his civil rights under section 1983, claiming as\nrelevant here that (1) the officers conducted an unlawful search when Knox walked\ntoward the shop and rifle; and (2) the officers used excessive force when they arrested\n\n\n\n7In 2003, the superior court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s felony conviction pursuant to Penal\nCode section 1203.4.\n\n                                              8\n\fhim. Plaintiff also alleged state law claims including a claim against all defendants for\nviolation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1) (Bane Act), and claims\nagainst Knox and Garrett for battery by a peace officer and assault.8\n       Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary\nadjudication as to plaintiff\u2019s claims, dividing the claims into 20 separate issues. As\nrelevant to plaintiff\u2019s claims on appeal, defendants argued the officers\u2019 entry onto\nplaintiff\u2019s property was excused by the exigent circumstances or emergency exceptions to\nthe warrant requirement, the officers\u2019 use of force was objectively reasonable, and, to the\nextent the officers committed any constitutional violations, they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n       Defendants also moved for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s state law claims.\nThey argued for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s Bane Act claim on the basis the\nofficers did not commit a constitutional violation, and as to plaintiff\u2019s assault and battery\nclaims on the basis that the officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.\n       In support of their motion, defendants submitted a separate statement of\nundisputed material facts, as well as deposition transcript excerpts, declarations, the\ncounty\u2019s use of force policy and search and seizure policy, the printout showing plaintiff\nwas convicted of a felony and the Penal Code 1203.4 dismissal order, and plaintiff\u2019s\nresponses to defendants\u2019 discovery requests.\n\n\n\n8 Plaintiff also alleged section 1983 claims on the basis that the officers: (1) conducted\nunlawful searches when Garrett walked past the rope across Joint Road, and when Knox\nand Garrett drove onto the driveway in front of his shop; (2) conducted an unlawful\nseizure by arresting him without probable cause; and (3) inflicted cruel and unusual\npunishment when arresting him. He also alleged state law claims against Knox and\nGarrett for false imprisonment and conspiracy. The trial court granted defendants\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment as to these issues and claims, and plaintiff does not\nchallenge those rulings on appeal.\n\n                                               9\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Opposition\n       Plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants\u2019 motion. He asserted the officers had no\nlegal excuse for entering his property, there was a triable issue as to whether the officers\u2019\nuse of force was excessive, and the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause they violated clearly established law. Plaintiff also asserted his Bane Act claim\nand other state law claims survived summary judgment based on the unlawful acts of the\nofficers.\n       Plaintiff responded to defendants\u2019 separate statement of undisputed facts and\nadded his own responsive material facts. He included numerous exhibits in support of his\nopposition, including deposition transcript excerpts, his declaration, incident reports\nwritten by Knox and Garrett, and defendants\u2019 written discovery responses.\n       Defendants\u2019 Reply\n       Defendants emphasized in reply that an exigent circumstance excused their entry\nonto plaintiff\u2019s property because the officers saw plaintiff run toward the rifle, and the\nlevel of force used by the officers was objectively reasonable. Defendants further\nreiterated that plaintiff\u2019s state law claims must be dismissed, and the officers were\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n       Defendants filed a response to plaintiff\u2019s additional undisputed facts, a reply to\nplaintiff\u2019s response to defendants\u2019 separate statement of undisputed material facts, and\nobjections to plaintiff\u2019s evidence in support of his opposition.\n       Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n       The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion in its entirety. The court orally\npronounced its ruling and subsequently issued a written order containing only the ruling\non each issue. As relevant to the issues on appeal, the court concluded the emergency or\nexigent circumstances doctrine excused the officers\u2019 entry onto the property when they\nsaw the rifle; the court recognized that the officers believed plaintiff was a convicted\nfelon prohibited from owning firearms, they had a legal right and duty to arrest him, and\n\n                                             10\n\fplaintiff had \u201ctaken off running to the bench where a high powered rifle was located.\u201d\nThe court opined that the officers identified themselves and told plaintiff repeatedly to\nget down, and when he did not, they used reasonable force to take him to the ground.\nBased on these rulings, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion as to plaintiff\u2019s remaining\nclaims. Finally, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity,\nalthough its previous rulings had rendered that issue moot.\n       The trial court entered judgment of dismissal as to all defendants on May 9, 2019.\nDefendants filed notice of entry of judgment on May 31, 2019. Plaintiff timely appealed.\nThe case was fully briefed in February 2021, and argument was held at the court\u2019s\nrequest on June 17, 2021.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n                                    Standard of Review\n       On a motion for summary judgment, a defendant must show \u201cthat one or more\nelements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete\ndefense to the cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Summary\njudgment is appropriate only \u201cif all the papers submitted show that there is no triable\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.\u201d (Id., subd. (c).) A triable issue of material fact exists if the evidence and\ninferences therefrom would allow a reasonable juror to find the underlying fact in favor\nof the party opposing summary judgment. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)\n25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)\n       \u201cBecause this case comes before us after the trial court granted a motion for\nsummary judgment, we take the facts from the record that was before the trial court when\nit ruled on that motion. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo,\nconsidering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposing papers except that to\nwhich objections were made and sustained.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] We liberally construe the\n\n                                             11\n\fevidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts\nconcerning the evidence in favor of that party.\u201d (Yanowitz v. L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc., supra,\n36 Cal.4th at p. 1037.)\n       \u201cIn performing an independent review of the granting of summary judgment, we\nconduct the same procedure employed by the trial court. We examine (1) the pleadings\nto determine the elements of the claim, (2) the motion to determine if it establishes facts\njustifying judgment in the moving party\u2019s favor, and (3) the opposition\u2014assuming\nmovant has met its initial burden\u2014to \u2018decide whether the opposing party has\ndemonstrated the existence of a triable, material fact issue. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] We\nneed not defer to the trial court and are not bound by the reasons in its summary\njudgment ruling; we review the ruling of the trial court, not its rationale.\u201d (Oakland\nRaiders v. National Football League (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 621, 630.)\n       Furthermore, our review is governed by a fundamental principle of appellate\nprocedure, namely, that \u201c \u2018[a] judgment or order of the lower court is presumed\ncorrect,\u2019 \u201d and thus, \u201c \u2018error must be affirmatively shown.\u2019 \u201d (Denham v. Superior Court\n(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) Under this principle, plaintiff bears the burden of establishing\nerror on appeal, even though defendants had the burden of proving their right to summary\njudgment before the trial court. (Frank and Freedus v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1996) 45\nCal.App.4th 461, 474.) For this reason, our review is limited to contentions adequately\nraised and supported in plaintiff\u2019s brief. (Christoff v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2005)\n134 Cal.App.4th 118, 125-126.)\n                                             II\n                                  Unlawful Search Claim\n       Plaintiff contends his section 1983 claim survives summary judgment because a\nreasonable jury could find that his injuries were proximately caused by the officers\u2019\nwarrantless entry, which was presumptively unreasonable and was not excused by an\nexception to the warrant requirement. Defendants respond that the undisputed facts\n\n                                             12\n\fdemonstrate that an exigent circumstance or emergency was created when plaintiff began\nrunning toward the rifle, giving rise to the officers\u2019 objectively reasonable belief that their\nsafety was in danger and excusing their warrantless entry onto plaintiff\u2019s curtilage.\n        As we will explain, we conclude there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to\nwhether the officers violated plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights before any exigent\ncircumstances existed, which would preclude the officers from relying on that exception\nto the warrant requirement. Accordingly, we agree with plaintiff that a reasonable jury\ncould find that his injuries were proximately caused by the officers\u2019 warrantless entry.9\n        A. Fourth Amendment Background\n        Section 1983 requires plaintiff to \u201cplead that (1) the defendants acting under color\nof state law (2) deprived plaintiffs of rights secured by the Constitution or federal\nstatutes.\u201d (Gibson v. United States (9th Cir. 1986) 781 F.2d 1334, 1338.) The Fourth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures . . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., amend. IV.) \u201cIt is fundamental that the Fourth Amendment\nonly protects from unreasonable searches \u2018those areas in which a person has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\u2019 [Citation.] Plainly, a private home is a place in which an\nindividual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. [Citation.] Land or structures\nimmediately adjacent to and intimately associated with one\u2019s home, referred to as\n\u2018curtilage,\u2019 are ordinarily considered part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment\npurposes.\u201d (People v. Williams (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 111, 120.) Searches and seizures\ninside of a home, or within the curtilage, without a warrant are presumptively\nunreasonable. (United States v. Martinez (9th Cir. 2005) 406 F.3d 1160, 1163; United\n\n\n\n\n9   We discuss whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity post.\n\n                                              13\n\fStates v. Duenas (9th Cir. 2012) 691 F.3d 1070, 1080-1081 [curtilage warrants same\nFourth Amendment protection as the home].)\n       Officers have the right to enter the curtilage of a home for purposes of engaging in\na consensual encounter with one or more occupants of a home. (Kentucky v. King (2011)\n563 U.S. 452, 463 (Kentucky).) However, \u201c[w]hen a law enforcement officer physically\nintrudes on the curtilage to gather evidence, a search within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment has occurred. [Citation.] Such conduct thus is presumptively unreasonable\nabsent a warrant.\u201d (Collins v. Virginia (2018) ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 1663, 1670; see\nalso Florida v. Jardines (2013) 569 U.S. 1, 8 [although officers have the right to enter the\ncurtilage for purposes of speaking with occupants, entering the curtilage for purposes of\n\u201csnooping around\u201d constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment].)\n       \u201cThe ability to observe inside curtilage from a lawful vantage point is not the same\nas the right to enter curtilage without a warrant for the purpose of conducting a search to\nobtain information not otherwise accessible. [Citation.] [A curtilage] into which an\nofficer can see from the street is no less entitled to protection from trespass and a\nwarrantless search than a fully enclosed garage.\u201d (Collins v. Virginia, supra, 138 S.Ct. at\np. 1675.) Thus, while a warrant is not required to observe readily visible items within the\ncurtilage, and officers are not required to shield their eyes when passing by a home on\npublic thoroughfares (California v. Ciraolo (1986) 476 U.S. 207, 213-214), a warrant is\nrequired to enter the home or the curtilage in the absence of an exception to the warrant\nrequirement (United States v. Perea-Rey (9th Cir. 2012) 680 F.3d 1179, 1185, 1186\n(Perea-Rey) [a driveway and carport is part of the curtilage, and any entry into the\ncurtilage by officers seeking information or evidence is a \u201csearch\u201d that is presumptively\nunreasonable, even where the officers could see into the curtilage]).\n       B. Exigency Exception to the Warrant Requirement\n       There are several exceptions to the warrant requirement. (Kentucky, supra, 563\nU.S. at pp. 459-460.) One such exception is the existence of exigent circumstances,\n\n                                             14\n\fwhich justify a warrantless entry, search, or seizure when \u201c \u2018the exigencies of the\nsituation\u2019 make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is\nobjectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Mincey v. Arizona (1978) 437\nU.S. 385, 394.) \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is\u201d \u2019 one\nsuch \u2018 \u201cjustification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or\nemergency.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (United States v. Snipe (9th Cir. 2008) 515 F.3d 947, 950-951.)\n       We apply a two-pronged test to determine whether the exigent circumstances\nexception applies: \u201c(1) considering the totality of the circumstances, law enforcement\nhad an objectively reasonable basis for concluding that there was an immediate need to\nprotect others or themselves from serious harm; and (2) the search\u2019s scope and manner\nwere reasonable to meet the need.\u201d (United States v. Snipe, supra, 515 F.3d at p. 952;\nHopkins v. Bonvicino (9th Cir. 2009) 573 F.3d 752, 763-764.) Exceptions to the warrant\nrequirement \u201care \u2018narrow\u2019 and their boundaries are \u2018rigorously guarded\u2019 to prevent any\nexpansion that would unduly interfere with the sanctity of the home.\u201d (Hopkins, at\np. 763.) Accordingly, officers arguing the existence of exigent circumstances \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust\nbe able to point to specific and articulable facts from which he concluded that his action\nwas necessary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Ovieda (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1034, 1043; see also Welsh v.\nWisconsin (1984) 466 U.S. 740, 749-750 [police officers \u201cbear a heavy burden when\nattempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or\narrest\u201d].) Further, officers cannot rely on the exigent circumstances exception to the\nwarrant requirement where they \u201ccreate the exigency by engaging or threatening to\nengage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Kentucky, supra, 563 U.S. at\np. 462.) For example, in United States v. Lundin (9th Cir. 2016) 817 F.3d 1151, at page\n1158, officers stood on a house\u2019s front porch at 4:00 a.m. and knocked on the front door.\nThey heard crashing noises from the backyard, which they later asserted constituted an\nexigent circumstance, and they went around the house into the back yard. The federal\nappellate court observed that the officers caused the crashing noises by knocking on the\n\n                                             15\n\fdoor, and therefore they were required to show that they lawfully stood on the porch\nwhen they created the exigency. The court concluded that, while officers are entitled to\nencroach upon the curtilage of a home for purposes of engaging in a consensual\nencounter with the occupants, they exceeded their license to \u201cknock and talk\u201d because\nthey knocked on the door at 4:00 a.m. with the intent to arrest the occupant, not ask\nquestions. (Id. at p. 1159.) Because the officers were not authorized to be on the porch at\nthe time they created the exigency, they could not rely on the exigent circumstances\nexception to justify entering the backyard without a warrant. (Ibid.)\n       Conversely, in United States v. Ojeda (9th Cir. 2002) 276 F.3d 486, at pages 488\nto 489, the federal appellate court concluded the exigent circumstances exception did\nindeed apply where officers searched a rear building, where a drug laboratory was\nlocated, although they had only obtained a search warrant to search a house near the\nbuilding. The officers asserted that exigent circumstances existed because the suspects\nknew the officers were on the property, and their presence would have caused the\nsuspects to destroy evidence. (Id. at p. 488.) The court concluded the officers did not\ncreate the exigency, which would have precluded application of the exigent\ncircumstances exception, because the officers did not exhibit any intentionally evasive\nbehavior or act in deliberate bad faith; the officers had the right to be on the premises as it\nwas described in the search warrant, and the omission of the building from the search\nwarrant was inadvertent, not intentional. (Id. at p. 489; see also United States v.\nVonWillie (9th Cir. 1995) 59 F.3d 922, 926 [rule that government cannot create its own\nexigency does not apply where the government did not purposefully try to circumvent\nstatutory requirements].)\n       \u201c[T]he question whether exigent circumstances existed is generally one for the\njury. [Citations.] We can affirm the judgment, therefore, only if \u2018the underlying facts are\nessentially undisputed, and . . . a finder of fact could reach but one conclusion as to the\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fexistence of exigent circumstances.\u2019 \u201d (Lyall v. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2015) 807\nF.3d 1178, 1189.)\n       C. Analysis\n       Defendants contend that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry onto plaintiff\u2019s property\nwas excused by the exigent circumstances exception because they entered the property to\nstop plaintiff from obtaining the rifle and using it against them. They add that there is no\nevidence the officers were violating plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights at the time\nplaintiff began running for the rifle, and therefore they could not have created their own\nexigency. (See Kentucky, supra, 563 U.S. at p. 462 [availability of the exigent\ncircumstances exception depends on whether the officers were committing or threatening\nto commit a Fourth Amendment violation at the time the exigency was created]; United\nStates v. Lundin, supra, 817 F.3d at p. 1158.)\n       We disagree and conclude there is a triable issue as to whether the officers were\nviolating plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights at the time plaintiff began running for the\nrifle. In his deposition, plaintiff asserted that Knox was past the SUV and was \u201cprobably\nhalfway around [his] shop\u201d by the time plaintiff started to run toward the rifle.\nSpecifically, plaintiff said he saw Knox through the windows at the northwest corner of\nthe shop before he ran from the porch toward the rifle, while Clendenen said Knox\n\u201cheaded north and then east around the corner. And [plaintiff] came off the back porch.\u201d\n       A reasonable jury crediting this testimony could find that Knox had violated the\nFourth Amendment by leaving the public driveway and entering plaintiff\u2019s curtilage, in\nwhich plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy, before plaintiff began running\ntoward the rifle.10 (See Perea-Rey, supra, 680 F.3d at pp. 1185, 1186.) If this were the\ncase, the exigent circumstance exception would not apply to excuse the violation.\n\n\n\n10 We recognize that the trial court is required to determine the scope of the curtilage as\na question of law. (United States v. Johnson (9th Cir. 2001) 256 F.3d 895, 902; see also\n\n                                             17\n\f       Moreover, if Knox walked toward the rifle for the purpose of gathering evidence,\nrather than engaging in a consensual encounter with plaintiff, Knox\u2019s entry into\nplaintiff\u2019s curtilage would not be excused by the \u201cknock and talk\u201d exception. (See\nPerea-Rey, supra, 680 F.3d at p. 1188 [constitutionality of police incursion into curtilage\ndepends on \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s actions are consistent with an attempt to initiate\nconsensual contact with the occupants of the home\u201d]; People v. Lujano (2014) 229\nCal.App.4th 175, 184 [officers entitled to enter curtilage to engage in consensual\nencounter to confirm or dispel reasonable suspicion of criminal activity].) Further, if a\nFourth Amendment violation occurred, a reasonable jury could find that the incursion,\nwhich caused plaintiff to fear robbery and run for his rifle, proximately caused his\ninjuries.\n       Because we conclude there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Knox was\ncommitting a Fourth Amendment violation at the time plaintiff first ran toward the rifle,\nthe trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment.\n                                             III\n                                  Excessive Force Claim\n       Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by granting defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment as to his section 1983 claim of excessive force. We agree.11\n       Claims that police officers used excessive force in the course of an arrest,\ninvestigatory stop or other \u201cseizure\u201d of a free citizen are analyzed under the\nreasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\n\nUnited States v. Dunn (1987) 480 U.S. 294, 301 [factors for determining the scope of the\ncurtilage include \u201cthe proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether\nthe area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to\nwhich the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from\nobservation by people passing by\u201d].)\n11 We address plaintiff\u2019s claim that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity\npost.\n\n                                             18\n\fpolice officers may use force to the extent that it is objectively reasonable under the\ncircumstances. (Graham v. Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, 395, 397 (Graham).)\nDetermining whether an officer\u2019s actions are objectively reasonable requires balancing\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cthe nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment\ninterests\u201d \u2019 against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.\u201d (Id. at p. 396; see\nalso Deorle v. Rutherford (9th Cir. 2001) 272 F.3d 1272, 1284-1285 [\u201cLess than deadly\nforce, like deadly force, may not be used without sufficient reason; rather, it is subject to\nthe Graham balancing test\u201d].) In other words, \u201c \u2018[t]he force which [i]s applied must be\nbalanced against the need for that force.\u2019 \u201d (Deorle, at p. 1279.) \u201c[I]t is the need for\nforce which is at the heart of the Graham factors.\u201d (Liston v. County of Riverside (1997)\n120 F.3d 965, 976.)\n       \u201c \u2018The \u201creasonableness\u201d of a particular use of force must be judged from the\nperspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather with the 20/20 vision of\nhindsight.\u2019 \u201d (Graham, supra, 490 U.S. at p. 396.) \u201c \u2018The calculus of reasonableness\nmust embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-\nsecond judgments\u2014in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014\nabout the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u2019 \u201d (Glenn v.\nWashington County (9th Cir. 2011) 673 F.3d 864, 871.)\n       The \u201cinherently fact-specific determination whether the force used to effect an\narrest was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment should only be taken from the jury in\nrare cases.\u201d (Headwaters Forest Def. v. County of Humboldt (9th Cir. 2000) 240 F.3d\n1185, 1205-1206, vacated and remanded on other grounds, 534 U.S. 801 (2001).) \u201cFor\npurposes of summary judgment, even in a qualified immunity case, we must assume the\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\fnonmoving party\u2019s version of the facts to be correct. \u201d (Liston v. Riverside, supra,\n120 F.3d at p. 977.)\n       A. Government Interests\n       In determining the government\u2019s interest in the use of force, we pay \u201ccareful\nattention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of\nthe crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the\nofficers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest\nby flight.\u201d (Graham, supra, 490 U.S. at p. 396.) \u201cThe most important Graham factor is\nwhether the suspect posed an immediate threat to anyone\u2019s safety.\u201d (Nehad v. Browder\n(9th Cir. 2019) 929 F.3d 1125, 1132 (Nehad).) Courts may consider other relevant\nfactors in evaluating the totality of the circumstances. (Mattos v. Agarano (9th Cir. 2011)\n661 F.3d 433, 441, 451.)\n       Here, it is undisputed that plaintiff was urgently running toward the rifle because\nhe thought he was being robbed, and there is little doubt he would have obtained it and, at\nthe very least, threatened Knox and Garrett with it. However, \u201c[s]ometimes . . . officers\nthemselves may \u2018unnecessarily creat[e] [their] own sense of urgency.\u2019 [Citations.] . . .\nReasonable triers of fact can, taking the totality of the circumstances into account,\nconclude that an officer\u2019s poor judgment or lack of preparedness caused him or her to act\nunreasonably, \u2018with undue haste.\u2019 \u201d (Nehad, supra, 929 F.3d at p. 1135.)\n       Additionally, we may consider an officer\u2019s failure to identify himself in\ndetermining whether the use of force was reasonable. (Nehad, supra, 929 F.3d at\np. 1138.) Defendants contend that whether the officers identified themselves is only\nrelevant in cases where the officers applied a very high degree of force. But if an\nofficer\u2019s failure to identify themself is relevant to whether the officer\u2019s use of force was\nreasonable, we may consider it. (See McKenzie v. Lamb (9th Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 1005,\n1010-1011 [plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of excessive force where plain clothes\nofficers burst into hotel room with weapons drawn, forced plaintiffs against the wall,\n\n                                             20\n\fhandcuffed them, threw them to the floor, and pressed guns to their heads while refusing\nto identify themselves].)\n       We agree that there is a material dispute as to whether the officers\u2019 earlier actions\ncreated their later need to use force. As we have set forth in detail above, they arrived at\nplaintiff\u2019s rural home in plain clothes and in an unmarked SUV for the express purpose of\nprovoking him into brandishing a weapon that they suspected he possessed illegally.\nThey did not identify themselves as police officers. As plaintiff stood on his porch\ncalling 911 due to the officers\u2019 suspicious behavior, Knox began quickly walking onto\nplaintiff\u2019s property toward the rifle. Plaintiff then ran toward the rifle, believing the\nofficers were planning to steal his property and possibly threaten his life. Knox and\nGarrett, interpreting plaintiff\u2019s actions as a threat, ran to cut off his path to the rifle.\nKnox only shouted \u201csheriff\u2019s office\u201d after causing plaintiff to run toward the rifle, and\nwhile aiming a gun at plaintiff\u2019s head from inches away. Plaintiff failed to immediately\nprocess that the men were law enforcement as he faced down the barrel of a gun. Then,\nin the one to two seconds that lapsed as plaintiff moved back so he could get on the\nground as Knox commanded, he was tackled from behind by Garrett and thereby injured.\nAs he was being arrested, he realized the men were law enforcement officers. It is not\nclear as a matter of law that the officers\u2019 earlier actions did not create their later need to\nuse force.\n       Moreover, a reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 failure to shout \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice\u201d until the last possible moment caused the exigency. Plaintiff was calling 911 to\nrequest law enforcement\u2019s help with the ongoing situation when Knox moved toward the\nrifle. The jury could find that, had the officers first identified themselves, plaintiff would\nhave complied with their instructions and been able to explain his understanding that his\nprior felony conviction had been dismissed under Penal Code section 1203.4. Indeed,\nthere is evidence that plaintiff was relieved when he learned that the men were officers,\nstating in his deposition that, while he was on the ground being handcuffed, he \u201ckind of\n\n                                                21\n\ffigured it out that [he] wasn\u2019t going to get killed.\u201d Similarly, after Clendenen saw\nKnox\u2019s badge as he ran, she \u201cfelt a little more comfortable knowing that he was law\nenforcement.\u201d\n       Further, the jury could also find that the officers, having already seen the rifle,\nlacked an additional covert investigatory objective that would require them to continue to\nconceal their identities until they had defendant at gunpoint.\n       Even if an illegal search did not occur, a reasonable jury could find that the\nofficers\u2019 use of force was unreasonable given their actions in trying to provoke an armed\nresponse from plaintiff, the role that Knox\u2019s act of moving toward the rifle played in\ncreating any exigency, and the officers\u2019 failure to identify themselves until they had\nplaintiff at close range gunpoint, one to two seconds before tackling him from behind.\n       There is also a triable issue as to whether plaintiff was resisting or seeking to\nevade arrest. (Graham, supra, 490 U.S. at p. 396.) Before Knox shouted: \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice,\u201d there is no evidence that plaintiff resisted or sought to evade arrest; he was not\naware that Knox and Garrett were law enforcement. Plaintiff testified he did not realize\nthat the men were officers until he was handcuffed on the ground. But even if plaintiff\nwere on notice that the men were law enforcement when Knox first said: \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice,\u201d a reasonable factfinder could find that plaintiff did not resist or seek to evade\narrest. He backed up to get on the ground immediately upon being ordered to do so by\nKnox, and he then was tackled almost immediately. A jury crediting plaintiff\u2019s version\nof events could find that plaintiff attempted to comply with Knox\u2019s command and did not\nattempt to reach for the rifle, reach for Knox\u2019s gun, wrestle with Knox, or do anything\nsuggesting resistance. After plaintiff was tackled, defendants contend that the officers\nstruggled with him to get his arms out from under his body and handcuff him. But\nplaintiff testified that he could not get his hands from underneath his body because the\nofficers were on top of him. A reasonable jury could find that plaintiff was not resisting\nand that instead he was trying to comply but was unable to move his arms.\n\n                                              22\n\f       Finally, the crime of which plaintiff was suspected here--unlawfully possessing a\nfirearm--is not a serious crime as the law defines it. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c).)\nWe recognize, however, that the severity of the crime at issue is of less importance when\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances, where the reasonableness of the officers\u2019\nactions largely depends on the officers\u2019 role in creating the urgency they were then\nrequired to use force to eliminate.\n       Defendants argue that this case is analogous to Godoy v. County of Sonoma (N.D.\nCal., Jul. 22, 2016, 15-cv-00883-WHO) 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 96159, an unreported\nfederal district court decision with no precedential value.12 There, the excessive force\nclaim was based on two plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that a knee was pressed into their backs\nduring handcuffing, one plaintiff\u2019s claim that an officer continued to point a gun at him\nafter he was handcuffed, and one plaintiff\u2019s claim that an officer pulled her hand in the\nwrong direction while she was being handcuffed. (Id. at p. *18.) The district court\nconcluded that an officer\u2019s use of a knee to restrain an individual can be part of normal\nhandcuffing procedure, and neither plaintiff alleged lasting injuries resulting from the\nknee in their backs. (Ibid.) The plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding a gun being pointed at\nhim was inconclusive at best, thus failing to raise a material dispute. (Ibid.) The court\nobserved that none of the plaintiffs claimed a gun was thrust or pointed at their face in\nclose proximity. (Id. at p. *21.) The plaintiff who claimed the officer pulled her arm in\nthe wrong direction was able to pull her arm away and voluntarily place it behind her\nback. (Id. at p. *20.) Finally, the court concluded that the officers were not able to\n\n\n\n\n12 We may cite and rely on unpublished federal district court decisions as persuasive\nauthority (Mendoza v. City of West Covina (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 702, 717, fn. 13;\nFutrell v. Payday California, Inc. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1433, fn. 6), and \u201cwe\nmay consider such decisions when determining whether a constitutional right was clearly\nestablished for purposes of our qualified immunity analysis\u201d (Mendoza, at p. 717, fn. 13;\nDrummond v. City of Anaheim (9th Cir. 2003) 343 F.3d 1052, 1060).\n\n                                             23\n\fobserve the plaintiffs for a significant period to determine whether they were armed, and\ntherefore it was reasonable for the officers to believe Godoy was armed and could pose\nan immediate threat to officers or others in a crowd that had gathered at the scene. (Id. at\np. *21.)\n       As we have discussed at length, the facts here are distinguishable from those in\nGodoy. Here a reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 need to use any level of force\nwas due to their own conduct. Additionally, there is evidence that Knox aimed a gun at\nplaintiff\u2019s face from eight or nine inches away. Moreover, not only did the officers have\nsubstantial opportunity to observe plaintiff to determine whether he was armed, the sole\npurpose of their operation was to provoke him to brandish a weapon. Accordingly, we do\nnot agree that the officers\u2019 use of force was analogous to Godoy.\n       B. Nature and Quality of Intrusion\n       Evaluating the nature of the intrusion requires an assessment of \u201c \u2018the type and\namount of force inflicted.\u2019 \u201d (Deorle v. Rutherford, supra, 272 F.3d at p. 1279.) The\namount of force used may be excessive even where some force is justified. (Glenn v.\nWashington County, supra, 673 F.3d at p. 871.) \u201cIn evaluating reasonableness, we may\nconsider the presence and severity of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but injuries are not required.\u201d\n(Cortesluna v. Leon (9th Cir. 2020) 979 F.3d 645, 653-654; see also Floyd v. Laws (9th\nCir. 1991) 929 F.2d 1390, 1402-1403 [court may award nominal damages where a jury\nfinds for plaintiff on excessive force claim but awards no damages].)\n       At summary judgment, the parties agreed to several undisputed facts related to the\namount of force applied by the officers: (1) plaintiff was faced with a gun pointed at his\nhead; (2) one to two seconds later, Garrett hit plaintiff from behind and threw him to the\nground; (3) plaintiff went to the ground on his front side and blocked his fall with his\nhands; (4) when plaintiff was on the ground, either Knox or Garrett shoved his face into\nthe ground, and both Knox and Garrett were on his back; (5) plaintiff complained that his\nhands hurt because his handcuffs were too tight; (6) \u201cplaintiff did not break any bones as\n\n                                              24\n\fa result of the incident, and his claimed physical injuries consist [sic] \u2018right flank pain\u2019\nand an exacerbation of prior pain and injuries.\u201d\n       On appeal, plaintiff contends that the record contains evidence of \u201cphysical and\npsychological injuries\u201d he suffered in the encounter. The materials on summary\njudgment state that plaintiff suffered from PTSD, and he had chronic pain in his neck,\nknee, and back. He asserted that he suffered from nightmares, nausea, and anxiety\nattacks, and that he sought treatment for medical and physical issues, anxiety, and\ndepression.\n       Defendants urge us to not consider plaintiff\u2019s evidence beyond the facts agreed to\nin the undisputed statement of facts. We recognize that, \u201cwhere evidence is not\nreferenced, is hidden in voluminous papers, and is not called to the attention of the court\nat all, a summary judgment should not be reversed on grounds the court should have\nconsidered such evidence.\u201d (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank (2002)\n102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316.) But here, the trial court recognized that plaintiff stated he\nhad \u201cpains\u201d as a result of Garrett\u2019s tackle, and it concluded there was a lack of evidence\nof \u201cdoctors,\u201d or \u201canything else in there . . . which I would consider a fact which might\nassist in moving the matter to trial.\u201d In other words, the court concluded that a lack of\nmedical bills or other documentation supporting plaintiff\u2019s injuries supported summary\njudgment.\n       Crediting plaintiff\u2019s version of the events and incorporating our earlier references\nto the evidence, we conclude a reasonable jury could find that the officers used\nunreasonable force here by using any significant force at all. Additionally, even if some\nforce were justified to prevent plaintiff from obtaining the rifle, plaintiff testified he was\nattempting to get on the ground when he was tackled and driven to the ground after one\nor two seconds. Although we recognize plaintiff did not sustain severe physical injuries,\nunder the circumstances here we are unable to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s excessive force\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n                                              25\n\f                                               IV\n                                      Qualified Immunity\n       Defendants contend that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to\nplaintiff\u2019s claim of an unlawful search and his claim of excessive force. As we will\nexplain, we disagree.\n       A. Legal Background\n       Police officers and other governmental officials performing discretionary\nfunctions are entitled to qualified immunity, shielding them from civil damages liability\nas long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they\nare alleged to have violated. (Anderson v. Creighton (1987) 483 U.S. 635, 638.) This\nprotection applies regardless of whether the government official\u2019s error is a mistake of\nlaw, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.\n(Pearson v. Callahan (2009) 555 U.S. 223, 231.)\n       In Saucier v. Katz (2001) 533 U.S. 194, at page 201, the high court mandated a\ntwo-step sequence for determining whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity:\n(1) whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a\nconstitutional right, and (2) if the plaintiff has satisfied the first step, whether the right at\nissue was \u201c \u2018clearly established\u2019 \u201d at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct. The\nhigh court has since concluded that the Saucier sequence may be appropriate and\nbeneficial, but is not mandatory. (Pearson v. Callahan, supra, 555 U.S. at p. 232.) We\nfind the Saucier procedure appropriate and beneficial here. As we have concluded, there\nis a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether plaintiff has shown a violation of a\nconstitutional right; thus, we proceed to the second step of the Saucier sequence.\n       It is the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden to show that the contours of the right were clearly\nestablished\u201d at the time of the alleged misconduct. (Clairmont v. Sound Mental Health\n(9th Cir. 2011) 632 F.3d 1091, 1109.) In order to conclude that the right that the official\nallegedly violated is \u201c \u2018clearly established,\u2019 \u201d \u201c[t]he contours of the right must be\n\n                                               26\n\fsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified\nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful [citation];\nbut it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u201d\n(Anderson v. Creighton, supra, 483 U.S. at 640; see also White v. Pauly (2017) __ U.S.\n___, 137 S.Ct. 548, 552 [\u201c \u2018[C]learly established law\u2019 should not be defined \u2018at a high\nlevel of generality\u2019 \u201d and must be particularized to the facts of the case]; Hope v. Pelzer\n(2002) 536 U.S. 730, 741 [\u201c[O]fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates\nestablished law even in novel factual circumstances\u201d]; Clairmont, at p. 1109 [there must\nbe some parallel or comparable fact pattern, but the facts of previously decided cases\nneed not match precisely those with which the government official is confronted];\nRodriguez v. County of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2018) 891 F.3d 776, 795 [\u201c \u2018[T]he focus is\non whether the officer had fair notice that [the officer\u2019s] conduct was unlawful\u2019 \u201d].)\n\u201cOtherwise, police officers would escape liability for even the most egregiously\nexcessive uses of force simply because there was no case on all fours prohibiting that\nprecise type of conduct.\u201d (Mendoza v. City of West Covina, supra, 206 Cal.App.4th at\np. 712.) \u201c \u2018[W]hen there are disputed factual issues that are necessary to a qualified\nimmunity decision, these issues must first be determined by the jury before the court can\nrule on qualified immunity.\u2019 \u201d (Morales v. Fry (9th Cir. 2017) 873 F.3d 817, 824.)\n       B. Unlawful Search Claim\n       Defendants contend there was no clearly established law at the time of the incident\nthat would have put the officers on notice that it was a constitutional violation to enter the\nproperty to secure the firearm while plaintiff ran toward it. But those are not the\nundisputed facts before us here. If a jury were to credit plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts,\nwhere Knox entered the curtilage without a warrant and without exigent circumstances,\nthen the entry was an illegal search, and the law is clear in that regard. (See, e.g., Perea-\nRey, supra, 680 F.3d at pp. 1186-1187 [an officer may not trespass on the curtilage\n\n                                              27\n\fwithout a warrant, an exception to the warrant requirement, even to merely \u201cknock and\ntalk\u201d].) Accordingly, we cannot say as a matter of law that defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity based on the facts before us.\n       C. Excessive Force Claim\n       Defendants also argue the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to\nplaintiff\u2019s excessive force claim because there is no particularized legal authority\ndemonstrating that the officers were not permitted to apprehend plaintiff in the manner\nthat occurred here. We disagree.\n       The officers were undoubtedly on notice that the Graham factors required them to\nuse a reasonable amount of force under the circumstances in arresting plaintiff, and that\nthey generally could not unreasonably create the circumstances then requiring them to\nuse force. Additionally, multiple cases have recognized that an officer\u2019s failure to\nidentify himself can lead to the unnecessary and excessive application of force.\n       In King v. United States (6th Cir. 2019) 917 F.3d 409, at page 431, reversed on\nother grounds in Brownback v. King (2021) ___ U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 740, the federal\nappellate court concluded that police officers would not be entitled to qualified immunity\nif a jury found that the officers failed to properly identify themselves, in which case the\nplaintiff could not have sought to resist or evade arrest because he would not have known\nan arrest was being attempted. In that case, the plaintiff asserted he ran away from the\nofficers only after asking them if he was being mugged. The court concluded that, if the\njury credited the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, any reasonable officer would have known that\ntackling the plaintiff, holding him down, choking him, and beating him into submission\nwas unreasonable under the circumstances. (Ibid.)13\n\n\n\n13 Defendants contend King does not assist plaintiff because it was decided after the\nevents in question. But while the King decision would not have put the officers on\nnotice, the court in King concluded that clearly established law recognized a reasonable\n\n                                             28\n\f       Similarly, in Atkinson v. City of Mountain View (8th Cir. 2013) 709 F.3d 1201, at\npage 1212, the court concluded that an officer had \u201c \u2018fair warning\u2019 that charging at a non-\nresisting individual without first identifying himself as a police officer was\nunconstitutional in the context of an arrest.\u201d Defendants contend Atkinson is inapposite\nbecause the plaintiff in that case was \u201cbull rushed\u201d by an officer without provocation and\nwas in the hospital for three weeks. But the issue is not whether the level of provocation\nor the extent of injuries are analogous to the facts here; rather, the issue is whether the\nofficers were on notice that their actions were unconstitutional. Here, like in Atkinson,\nthere is a question of fact as to whether the officers acted unreasonably under the\ncircumstances. In Atkinson, the court observed: \u201cA reasonable officer in [the officer\u2019s]\nposition\u2014without either of the first two Graham factors [whether the crime was severe\nor violent, or whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or\nothers] justifying a forceful arrest\u2014would not have thought it appropriate to charge [the\nplaintiff] without first identifying himself as law enforcement and giving [the plaintiff] a\nchance\u201d to peacefully comply. (Atkinson, at p. 1210.) Similarly, here, a jury crediting\nplaintiff\u2019s version of events could find that the officers failed to reasonably identify\nthemselves and then tackled him before giving him an opportunity to peacefully comply.\n       In Vlasak v. Las Vegas (9th Cir. 2006) 213 Fed.Appx. 512, at page 514, the federal\nappellate court concluded that whether officers were entitled to qualified immunity\ndepended on whether they identified themselves as police officers. The plaintiff asserted\nthe officers did not identify themselves until after he was wrestled to the floor and placed\nin handcuffs. If the officers did not identify themselves, \u201cthey unnecessarily created a\n\n\nofficer would ordinarily inform a suspect of a low-level crime that he was being arrested,\nespecially where there is no reason to not inform him that he is being arrested. (King,\nsupra, 917 F.3d at p. 431, citing Atkins v. Township of Flint (6th Cir. 2004) 94 Fed.Appx.\n342, 349.) Accordingly, we cite King for the proposition that clearly established law at\nthe time of the events here recognized that a reasonable officer should ordinarily inform a\nsuspect that he is under arrest.\n\n                                              29\n\fsituation in which [the plaintiff] understandably resisted their efforts to subdue him, and\nin which their use of force was unnecessary and therefore excessive.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       We recognize that Knox did, in fact, shout \u201csheriff\u2019s office\u201d when he had plaintiff\nat gunpoint. But as we have discussed at length ante, this was only after encroaching\nonto plaintiff\u2019s property without explanation in a manner that caused plaintiff to call for\nlaw enforcement assistance, and then moving to seize plaintiff\u2019s gun, all without\nrevealing his identity as a law enforcement officer. This series of deliberate actions left\nplaintiff with little to no time to appreciate that he was being confronted by members of\nlaw enforcement, rather than thieves, in the one to two seconds before he was tackled\nfrom behind. Accordingly, we cannot say as a matter of law that the officers were not on\nnotice that their conduct was unconstitutional, and therefore we conclude the officers are\nnot entitled to qualified immunity.14\n                                              V\n                                      State Law Claims\n       Plaintiff contends that his claims for violation of the Bane Act, battery by a peace\nofficer, and assault survive summary judgment. We agree.\n       A. Bane Act\n       The Bane Act makes it unlawful for any person to interfere by threat, intimidation,\nor coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise\nor enjoyment by any individual secured by the Constitution or laws of California. (See\nAustin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 881-883.)\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper\nmeans (i.e., \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from\ndoing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do\n\n\n\n14 Plaintiff argues that we should abrogate the doctrine of qualified immunity. Based on\nour holding, we need not address that argument.\n\n                                              30\n\fsomething that he or she was not required to do under the law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Cornell v. City &\nCounty of San Francisco (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 766, 791-792 (Cornell).) An officer\ncannot claim qualified immunity under the Bane Act. (Venegas v. County of Los Angeles\n(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1240-1247.)\n        The Bane Act does not require that \u201cthe offending \u2018threat, intimidation or\ncoercion\u2019 be \u2018independent\u2019 from the constitutional violation alleged.\u201d (Cornell, supra,\n17 Cal.App.5th at p. 800.) Rather, where an unlawful arrest is properly pleaded and\nproved, \u201cthe egregiousness required by [Civ. Code] [s]ection 52.1 is tested by whether\nthe circumstances indicate the arresting officer had a specific intent to violate the\narrestee\u2019s right to freedom from unreasonable seizure, not by whether the evidence shows\nsomething beyond the coercion \u2018inherent\u2019 in the wrongful detention.\u201d (Id. at pp. 801-\n802.)\n        There are two requirements for a finding of specific intent. (Cornell, supra,\n17 Cal.App.5th at p. 803.) First, the court must make the legal determination of whether\nthe \u201c \u2018 \u201cright at issue clearly delineated and plainly applicable under the circumstances of\nthe case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) Second, if the first condition is answered in the affirmative, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe\njury must make the second, factual, determination. Did the defendant commit the act in\nquestion with the particular purpose of depriving the citizen victim of his enjoyment of\nthe interests protected by that . . . right? If both requirements are met, even if the\ndefendant did not in fact recognize the [unlawfulness] of his act, he will be adjudged as a\nmatter of law to have acted [with the requisite specific intent]\u2014i.e., \u2018in reckless disregard\nof constitutional [or statutory] prohibitions or guarantees.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.)\n        Applying this standard here, the rights at issue are plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights\nto be free from unlawful search and excessive force. As we have discussed with respect\nto qualified immunity in the context of plaintiff\u2019s unlawful search and excessive force\nclaims, these rights are clearly defined.\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\f       Defendants contend there is no evidence that the officers acted with specific intent\nto deprive plaintiff of the enjoyment of his Fourth Amendment rights. But as the\nappellate court reiterated in Cornell, supra, 17 Cal.App.5th at page 804, \u201cwhether the\nappellant officers understood they were acting unlawfully was not a requirement.\nReckless disregard of the \u2018right at issue\u2019 is all that was necessary.\u201d As we have discussed\nand based on the facts before us, a reasonable jury could find that the officers recklessly\ndisregarded plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.\n       Defendants also contend plaintiff\u2019s complaint based his Bane Act claim on the\nofficers\u2019 violation of article I, section 13 of the California Constitution; they argue this\nbasis restricts his claim solely to one of unlawful search rather than also including\nexcessive force. We disagree.\n       First, the use of excessive force constitutes an unreasonable seizure under article I,\nsection 13. (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 13 [\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects against unreasonable seizures and searches may not be\nviolated; and a warrant may not issue except on probable cause, supported by oath or\naffirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to\nbe seized\u201d]; Susag v. City of Lake Forest (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1414 [4th Amend.\nclaim of excessive force requires demonstrating unreasonable seizure].) Second, plaintiff\ndid not bring his Bane Act claim directly under article I, section 13 of the California\nConstitution. (See Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 360,\n392 [California Supreme Court has \u201cnot decided whether there is a private cause of action\nfor damages under article I, section 13\u201d].) Plaintiff alleged that defendants\u2019 conduct\n\u201cviolated Article I, Section 13 of the Constitution of the State of California and Cal. Civ.\nCode \u00a7 52.1. [sic] in that Defendants Knox and Garrett used the threat of force and or\nintimidation to violate rights secured by the U.S. Constitution and The California State\nConstitution.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, he alleged facts constituting a violation of the Bane\nAct and sought relief under that Act. (See Venegas v. Los Angeles, supra, 153\n\n                                                 32\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 1232 [declining to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1 claims against\ntwo defendants for violations of their rights under the 4th Amend. and Cal. Const., art. I,\n\u00a7 13].)\n          B. Assault and Battery by a Peace Officer Claims\n          As to plaintiff\u2019s claims for battery by a peace officer and assault, the standard for\nproving those state law claims is the same standard applied to section 1983 actions. (See\nEdson v. City of Anaheim (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1274-1275 [both \u00a7 1983 actions\nand state law assault and battery by a peace officer claims require plaintiff to demonstrate\nthe unreasonableness of the force used].) Because we conclude plaintiff\u2019s section 1983\nclaim survives summary judgment, so too must his state law claims for battery by a peace\nofficer and assault.\n                                         DISPOSITION\n          The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to vacate its ruling on\nsummary judgment and enter a new order denying the motion as to the following causes\nof action as to Knox and Garrett: (1) the first cause of action under section 1983 based\non unlawful search and excessive force; (2) the second cause of action for violation of\nCivil Code section 52.1; (3) the fourth cause of action alleging battery by a peace officer;\nand (4) the fifth cause of action for assault. Costs of this appeal are awarded to plaintiff.\n(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a).)\n\n\n                                                           /s/\n                                                     Duarte, J.\nWe concur:\n\n\n      /s/\nRaye, P.

The trial court granted\ndefendants\u2019 summary judgment motion in its entirety.\n        On appeal, plaintiff contends there are triable issues of fact as to two of his claims\nunder title 42 United States Code section 1983,1 whether Knox and Garrett committed an\nunexcused warrantless search that proximately caused his injuries and whether they used\nexcessive force in detaining him. He also claims error in the granting of summary\njudgment as to his state law claims for violation of his constitutional rights, battery by a\npeace officer, and assault. As we will explain, we agree with plaintiff, and shall reverse\nthe trial court\u2019s judgment in part and remand with directions.\n                              FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n        The following facts are taken from the evidence set forth in the papers filed in\nconnection with defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, except that evidence to which\nobjections were properly made and sustained. (Yanowitz v. L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36\nCal.4th 1028, 1037.) We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,\nthe party opposing summary judgment, resolving any doubts concerning the evidence in\nhis favor. (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n1   Further references to section 1983 are to title 42 of the United States Code.\n\n                                               2\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Property\n       Plaintiff, who was almost 66 years old at the time of this incident, lived at the end\nof Joint Road in Red Bluff, California.2 The maintained section of Joint Road, which\nwas a public highway, ended where it passed plaintiff\u2019s house. The county posted a sign\nreading \u201cRoad Closed\u201d at that point, and plaintiff strung a rope across the road to prevent\npeople from driving onto the closed portion of Joint Road.\n       Formation of the Officers\u2019 Operation\n       A real estate agent and his client moved plaintiff\u2019s rope to drive past the Road\nClosed sign to look for property. Plaintiff told them the road was closed. The client told\nthe agent he thought plaintiff had a handgun in his pocket. The agent called the\nDepartment to discuss the incident and to confirm that he had a legal right to use the road.\nThe agent did not specifically recall telling anyone at the Department what the client had\ntold him about the handgun, but he said he may have done so.\n       Hencratt shared with Knox his belief that plaintiff was a convicted felon who was\nprohibited from owning firearms, and he directed Knox to investigate. Knox and Garrett\nresearched plaintiff\u2019s criminal record using a database maintained by the California\nDepartment of Justice and discovered that plaintiff was a convicted felon, which they\nbelieved precluded him from owning, possessing, or controlling firearms. Based on his\nresearch, it also appeared to Garrett that Joint Road was a public roadway and not\nplaintiff\u2019s private property.\n       Knox did not interview the real estate agent or his client; the client later explained\nthat he had \u201cseen something\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s hand, \u201cpossibly a gun,\u201d but that it \u201ccould be\nanything.\u201d The client acknowledged he was at least 100 feet away, had bad eyesight, and\njust assumed that \u201cfor somebody to live somewhere in the country, they have to have a\n\n\n\n2 Plaintiff asserted that his property is in an unincorporated portion of Tehama County.\nThis dispute is not relevant to our analysis.\n\n                                              3\n\fgun.\u201d Knox and Garrett did not obtain a warrant to search plaintiff\u2019s property; Knox\nacknowledged they did not have probable cause to secure a warrant at that time.\n         The Operation\n         Knox and Garrett drove an unmarked sports utility vehicle (SUV) to Joint Road\nnear plaintiff\u2019s property. They dressed in plain clothes in order to conceal their identity\nas law enforcement officers; they intended to provoke plaintiff into brandishing a firearm.\n         Garrett walked toward the Road Closed sign. Plaintiff walked out onto his deck\nfrom inside his house, and he told Knox and Garrett that the road was closed and they\nwould be trespassing if they proceeded. Garrett returned to the SUV, and plaintiff went\nback inside his house. Garrett then walked to the rope, stepped over it, and continued\nonto the closed section of Joint Road. Knox and Garrett observed a chronograph on the\nnorth side of plaintiff\u2019s property, which they were aware can be used to measure bullet\nspeed.\n         Plaintiff left his house, walked through his shop located adjacent to his house to\nthe north, grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper, and approached the SUV to record its\nlicense plate number. Plaintiff then walked back to his deck, where he called 911 from a\nlandline.\n         Garrett and Knox decided to leave. They backed the SUV onto a driveway to the\nwest of plaintiff\u2019s shop; the driveway was on plaintiff\u2019s property but was used for public\npurposes, including package pickups and deliveries. The SUV was facing west, meaning\nthe driver\u2019s side door faced toward plaintiff, who stood on his porch to the south of his\nshop.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Observing the Firearm and the Takedown\n       Garrett then saw a bolt-action rifle on top of a bench on the north side of plaintiff\u2019s\nshop, and Knox saw the rifle after Garrett told him about it. The rifle was unloaded, and\nits bolt was back, meaning it was not in a position to be fired.3 There was no one near the\nrifle at the time Garrett observed it.\n       Knox and Garrett got out of the SUV, Knox from the driver\u2019s side. Garrett\ntestified that they did not try to obtain a warrant at that time because \u201cat this time we\nwere there, and we decided that we were going to attempt to make contact with [plaintiff]\nin regards to the rifle.\u201d In his deposition, Garrett was asked: \u201cAnd what was the\nemergency that allowed you to enter [plaintiff\u2019s] property without a warrant?\u201d Counsel\nobjected, and Garrett did not answer. Following the objection, Garrett was again asked,\n\u201cWas there an emergency?\u201d Garrett responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there was an\nemergency.\u201d4\n       While plaintiff stood talking to the 911 operator on his porch, Knox began\n\u201cwalking very quickly\u201d toward the back of plaintiff\u2019s shop, in the direction of the rifle.\n\n\n\n3  The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 objection to plaintiff\u2019s declaration providing\nmeasurements between the SUV and the rifle, and from where plaintiff stood to the rifle.\nPlaintiff contests this ruling on appeal and argues that witnesses are authorized to give\ntestimony estimating distances. But plaintiff asserted in his declaration that he later\nmeasured the distances, not that he was estimating. Because plaintiff did not provide a\nproper foundation for how or when he measured the distances, the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in sustaining the objection. (See Serri v. Santa Clara University\n(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 830, 852 [\u201cAccording to the weight of authority, appellate courts\n\u2018review the trial court's evidentiary rulings on summary judgment for abuse of\ndiscretion\u2019 \u201d].)\n4 The trial court overruled defendants\u2019 objection to this testimony, recognizing that\n\u201cthose words are in the deposition.\u201d But the court determined that Garrett\u2019s statement did\nnot refer to the time of the use of force, nor did it \u201ctend to prove an illegal search,\nexcessive force, nor to negate the claim of exigent circumstances.\u201d We discuss this\nruling, post.\n\n                                              5\n\fKnox did not identify himself as law enforcement as he moved toward the rifle. Plaintiff\nbelieved he was being robbed; he began running toward the rifle along the east side of the\nshop--the side facing away from the SUV.\n       When asked where Knox was at the time plaintiff started running toward the rifle,\nplaintiff testified that \u201c[Knox] was probably halfway around my shop by then,\u201d5 and was\n\u201cpast his vehicle.\u201d Plaintiff later photographed his view of the shop and driveway from\nhis porch, where he had stood while talking to the 911 operator. He was able to see\nthrough a large opening in the south wall of his shop to two windows in the shop\u2019s\nnorthwest corner. He had drawn a circle around the windows, and he testified he could\nsee \u201cKnox get out of his vehicle and start in a fast pace towards the back of my shop right\nhere (indicating).\u201d He then stated: \u201cAnd through these windows here where I could see\nhim half [sic].\u201d\n       After seeing plaintiff begin to run, Knox and then Garrett began running, still\nmoving toward the rifle.6 They observed what they believed to be ammunition near the\nrifle; they believed plaintiff could obtain and load the rifle, and they feared plaintiff\nmight fire it at them.\n       According to Karen Clendenen, plaintiff\u2019s girlfriend who witnessed the events,\nKnox exited the SUV, \u201cstarted to walk, and then he was walking pretty fast almost a\nrun.\u201d She recalled that as Knox began to run, \u201che pulled his jacket back, and I saw a\nbadge, so at that time I felt a little more comfortable knowing that he was law\nenforcement. And he took out his service revolver, whatever you call their guns, and he\n\n\n\n5 The trial court overruled defendants\u2019 objection to this statement; defendants do not\nchallenge this ruling.\n6 Plaintiff disputed this fact and asserted that Knox was already halfway to the gun\nbefore plaintiff began running. Plaintiff does not dispute that Knox began running\ntoward the rifle, as opposed to continuing to walk toward it, only after plaintiff began\nrunning toward the rifle from his location on the porch.\n\n                                               6\n\fheaded north and then east around the corner. And [plaintiff] came off the back porch.\nHe was standing on the back porch talking to 911 on the speaker phone because our\nreceiver doesn\u2019t work. And he ran off the porch around the barbecue and over to the\ncorner.\u201d\n       Knox reached the rifle before plaintiff, but he continued past it, turning the\nnortheast corner of the shop. As plaintiff approached the shop\u2019s northeast corner, Knox\ncame around the corner, aimed his service weapon at plaintiff\u2019s head from a distance of\neight or nine inches, and yelled, \u201cSheriff\u2019s office, get to the fucking ground, asshole.\u201d\nPlaintiff did not hear the words \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d He explained: \u201c[W]hen I seen that\ngun in front of my face, I didn\u2019t hear nothing. I was waiting to get shot. I was waiting to\ndie right there. And I thought I was going to get killed for somebody trying to steal from\nme.\u201d\n       Plaintiff started to back up so he could get on the ground. One to two seconds\nlater, Garrett tackled plaintiff to the ground from behind. Plaintiff went to the ground on\nhis front side and blocked his fall with his hands. His arms were pinned beneath his\nbody, and Knox and Garrett were yelling at him to give them his arms. Either Knox or\nGarrett shoved plaintiff\u2019s face into the ground. Both officers were on his back. They\ngrabbed plaintiff\u2019s arms, pulled them behind his back, and handcuffed him, leaving him\nlying face down in the dirt for \u201ca minute, minute and a half if not longer.\u201d Plaintiff\nrealized Knox and Garrett were law enforcement while he was on the ground being\nhandcuffed.\n       Plaintiff\u2019s Release and His Injuries\n       Plaintiff complained that his hands were hurting, and the handcuffs were too tight.\nThe officers informed him that he was a felon in possession of a firearm, but plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fasserted he had an expungement order he believed allowed him to possess rifles.7 Garrett\nmoved plaintiff from the ground to sitting on an ice chest next to the shop, loosening his\nhandcuffs after he repeatedly complained. Knox confirmed that plaintiff\u2019s conviction had\nbeen expunged. The officers removed plaintiff\u2019s handcuffs and left.\n       In his discovery responses, plaintiff asserted he experienced \u201c[n]ew right flank\npain, increased left knee pain, increased neck pain, increased lower back pain, and PTSD\n[posttraumatic stress disorder]\u201d as a result of the incident. In another response, he added\nthat he felt pain in his right lower rib cage area and right hip, and had experienced\nnightmares, nausea, and anxiety attacks. In response to defendants\u2019 separate statement of\nundisputed material facts, plaintiff agreed that he did not break any bones, and that as a\nresult of the incident, he claimed physical injuries of \u201c \u2018right flank pain\u2019 and an\nexacerbation of prior pain and injuries.\u201d\n       On appeal, plaintiff refers to his discovery responses, included in the record on\nsummary judgment, and asserts that Garrett\u2019s takedown injured his lower back, neck, hip,\nand knee and caused him to suffer from sleeplessness, nightmares, nausea, and anxiety.\nHe asserts he was prescribed medication and received medical treatment for both physical\nand psychological injuries. Defendants urge us to not consider this evidence; we address\nthat issue in our Discussion, post.\n       Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint\n       Plaintiff filed suit. His first amended complaint, which is the operative pleading,\nasserted causes of action against Knox, Garrett, Hencratt, and Tehama County. Plaintiff\nclaimed that all defendants violated his civil rights under section 1983, claiming as\nrelevant here that (1) the officers conducted an unlawful search when Knox walked\ntoward the shop and rifle; and (2) the officers used excessive force when they arrested\n\n\n\n7In 2003, the superior court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s felony conviction pursuant to Penal\nCode section 1203.4.\n\n                                              8\n\fhim. Plaintiff also alleged state law claims including a claim against all defendants for\nviolation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1) (Bane Act), and claims\nagainst Knox and Garrett for battery by a peace officer and assault.8\n       Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary\nadjudication as to plaintiff\u2019s claims, dividing the claims into 20 separate issues. As\nrelevant to plaintiff\u2019s claims on appeal, defendants argued the officers\u2019 entry onto\nplaintiff\u2019s property was excused by the exigent circumstances or emergency exceptions to\nthe warrant requirement, the officers\u2019 use of force was objectively reasonable, and, to the\nextent the officers committed any constitutional violations, they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n       Defendants also moved for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s state law claims.\nThey argued for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s Bane Act claim on the basis the\nofficers did not commit a constitutional violation, and as to plaintiff\u2019s assault and battery\nclaims on the basis that the officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.\n       In support of their motion, defendants submitted a separate statement of\nundisputed material facts, as well as deposition transcript excerpts, declarations, the\ncounty\u2019s use of force policy and search and seizure policy, the printout showing plaintiff\nwas convicted of a felony and the Penal Code 1203.4 dismissal order, and plaintiff\u2019s\nresponses to defendants\u2019 discovery requests.\n\n\n\n8 Plaintiff also alleged section 1983 claims on the basis that the officers: (1) conducted\nunlawful searches when Garrett walked past the rope across Joint Road, and when Knox\nand Garrett drove onto the driveway in front of his shop; (2) conducted an unlawful\nseizure by arresting him without probable cause; and (3) inflicted cruel and unusual\npunishment when arresting him. He also alleged state law claims against Knox and\nGarrett for false imprisonment and conspiracy. The trial court granted defendants\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment as to these issues and claims, and plaintiff does not\nchallenge those rulings on appeal.\n\n                                               9\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Opposition\n       Plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants\u2019 motion. He asserted the officers had no\nlegal excuse for entering his property, there was a triable issue as to whether the officers\u2019\nuse of force was excessive, and the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause they violated clearly established law. Plaintiff also asserted his Bane Act claim\nand other state law claims survived summary judgment based on the unlawful acts of the\nofficers.\n       Plaintiff responded to defendants\u2019 separate statement of undisputed facts and\nadded his own responsive material facts. He included numerous exhibits in support of his\nopposition, including deposition transcript excerpts, his declaration, incident reports\nwritten by Knox and Garrett, and defendants\u2019 written discovery responses.\n       Defendants\u2019 Reply\n       Defendants emphasized in reply that an exigent circumstance excused their entry\nonto plaintiff\u2019s property because the officers saw plaintiff run toward the rifle, and the\nlevel of force used by the officers was objectively reasonable. Defendants further\nreiterated that plaintiff\u2019s state law claims must be dismissed, and the officers were\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n       Defendants filed a response to plaintiff\u2019s additional undisputed facts, a reply to\nplaintiff\u2019s response to defendants\u2019 separate statement of undisputed material facts, and\nobjections to plaintiff\u2019s evidence in support of his opposition.\n       Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n       The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion in its entirety. The court orally\npronounced its ruling and subsequently issued a written order containing only the ruling\non each issue. As relevant to the issues on appeal, the court concluded the emergency or\nexigent circumstances doctrine excused the officers\u2019 entry onto the property when they\nsaw the rifle; the court recognized that the officers believed plaintiff was a convicted\nfelon prohibited from owning firearms, they had a legal right and duty to arrest him, and\n\n                                             10\n\fplaintiff had \u201ctaken off running to the bench where a high powered rifle was located.\u201d\nThe court opined that the officers identified themselves and told plaintiff repeatedly to\nget down, and when he did not, they used reasonable force to take him to the ground.\nBased on these rulings, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion as to plaintiff\u2019s remaining\nclaims. Finally, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity,\nalthough its previous rulings had rendered that issue moot.\n       The trial court entered judgment of dismissal as to all defendants on May 9, 2019.\nDefendants filed notice of entry of judgment on May 31, 2019. Plaintiff timely appealed.\nThe case was fully briefed in February 2021, and argument was held at the court\u2019s\nrequest on June 17, 2021.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n                                    Standard of Review\n       On a motion for summary judgment, a defendant must show \u201cthat one or more\nelements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete\ndefense to the cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Summary\njudgment is appropriate only \u201cif all the papers submitted show that there is no triable\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.\u201d (Id., subd. (c).) A triable issue of material fact exists if the evidence and\ninferences therefrom would allow a reasonable juror to find the underlying fact in favor\nof the party opposing summary judgment. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)\n25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)\n       \u201cBecause this case comes before us after the trial court granted a motion for\nsummary judgment, we take the facts from the record that was before the trial court when\nit ruled on that motion. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo,\nconsidering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposing papers except that to\nwhich objections were made and sustained.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] We liberally construe the\n\n                                             11\n\fevidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts\nconcerning the evidence in favor of that party.\u201d (Yanowitz v. L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc., supra,\n36 Cal.4th at p. 1037.)\n       \u201cIn performing an independent review of the granting of summary judgment, we\nconduct the same procedure employed by the trial court. We examine (1) the pleadings\nto determine the elements of the claim, (2) the motion to determine if it establishes facts\njustifying judgment in the moving party\u2019s favor, and (3) the opposition\u2014assuming\nmovant has met its initial burden\u2014to \u2018decide whether the opposing party has\ndemonstrated the existence of a triable, material fact issue. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] We\nneed not defer to the trial court and are not bound by the reasons in its summary\njudgment ruling; we review the ruling of the trial court, not its rationale.\u201d (Oakland\nRaiders v. National Football League (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 621, 630.)\n       Furthermore, our review is governed by a fundamental principle of appellate\nprocedure, namely, that \u201c \u2018[a] judgment or order of the lower court is presumed\ncorrect,\u2019 \u201d and thus, \u201c \u2018error must be affirmatively shown.\u2019 \u201d (Denham v. Superior Court\n(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) Under this principle, plaintiff bears the burden of establishing\nerror on appeal, even though defendants had the burden of proving their right to summary\njudgment before the trial court. (Frank and Freedus v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1996) 45\nCal.App.4th 461, 474.) For this reason, our review is limited to contentions adequately\nraised and supported in plaintiff\u2019s brief. (Christoff v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2005)\n134 Cal.App.4th 118, 125-126.)\n                                             II\n                                  Unlawful Search Claim\n       Plaintiff contends his section 1983 claim survives summary judgment because a\nreasonable jury could find that his injuries were proximately caused by the officers\u2019\nwarrantless entry, which was presumptively unreasonable and was not excused by an\nexception to the warrant requirement. Defendants respond that the undisputed facts\n\n                                             12\n\fdemonstrate that an exigent circumstance or emergency was created when plaintiff began\nrunning toward the rifle, giving rise to the officers\u2019 objectively reasonable belief that their\nsafety was in danger and excusing their warrantless entry onto plaintiff\u2019s curtilage.\n        As we will explain, we conclude there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to\nwhether the officers violated plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights before any exigent\ncircumstances existed, which would preclude the officers from relying on that exception\nto the warrant requirement. Accordingly, we agree with plaintiff that a reasonable jury\ncould find that his injuries were proximately caused by the officers\u2019 warrantless entry.9\n        A. Fourth Amendment Background\n        Section 1983 requires plaintiff to \u201cplead that (1) the defendants acting under color\nof state law (2) deprived plaintiffs of rights secured by the Constitution or federal\nstatutes.\u201d (Gibson v. United States (9th Cir. 1986) 781 F.2d 1334, 1338.) The Fourth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures . . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., amend. IV.) \u201cIt is fundamental that the Fourth Amendment\nonly protects from unreasonable searches \u2018those areas in which a person has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\u2019 [Citation.] Plainly, a private home is a place in which an\nindividual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. [Citation.] Land or structures\nimmediately adjacent to and intimately associated with one\u2019s home, referred to as\n\u2018curtilage,\u2019 are ordinarily considered part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment\npurposes.\u201d (People v. Williams (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 111, 120.) Searches and seizures\ninside of a home, or within the curtilage, without a warrant are presumptively\nunreasonable. (United States v. Martinez (9th Cir. 2005) 406 F.3d 1160, 1163; United\n\n\n\n\n9   We discuss whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity post.\n\n                                              13\n\fStates v. Duenas (9th Cir. 2012) 691 F.3d 1070, 1080-1081 [curtilage warrants same\nFourth Amendment protection as the home].)\n       Officers have the right to enter the curtilage of a home for purposes of engaging in\na consensual encounter with one or more occupants of a home. (Kentucky v. King (2011)\n563 U.S. 452, 463 (Kentucky).) However, \u201c[w]hen a law enforcement officer physically\nintrudes on the curtilage to gather evidence, a search within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment has occurred. [Citation.] Such conduct thus is presumptively unreasonable\nabsent a warrant.\u201d (Collins v. Virginia (2018) ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 1663, 1670; see\nalso Florida v. Jardines (2013) 569 U.S. 1, 8 [although officers have the right to enter the\ncurtilage for purposes of speaking with occupants, entering the curtilage for purposes of\n\u201csnooping around\u201d constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment].)\n       \u201cThe ability to observe inside curtilage from a lawful vantage point is not the same\nas the right to enter curtilage without a warrant for the purpose of conducting a search to\nobtain information not otherwise accessible. [Citation.] [A curtilage] into which an\nofficer can see from the street is no less entitled to protection from trespass and a\nwarrantless search than a fully enclosed garage.\u201d (Collins v. Virginia, supra, 138 S.Ct. at\np. 1675.) Thus, while a warrant is not required to observe readily visible items within the\ncurtilage, and officers are not required to shield their eyes when passing by a home on\npublic thoroughfares (California v. Ciraolo (1986) 476 U.S. 207, 213-214), a warrant is\nrequired to enter the home or the curtilage in the absence of an exception to the warrant\nrequirement (United States v. Perea-Rey (9th Cir. 2012) 680 F.3d 1179, 1185, 1186\n(Perea-Rey) [a driveway and carport is part of the curtilage, and any entry into the\ncurtilage by officers seeking information or evidence is a \u201csearch\u201d that is presumptively\nunreasonable, even where the officers could see into the curtilage]).\n       B. Exigency Exception to the Warrant Requirement\n       There are several exceptions to the warrant requirement. (Kentucky, supra, 563\nU.S. at pp. 459-460.) One such exception is the existence of exigent circumstances,\n\n                                             14\n\fwhich justify a warrantless entry, search, or seizure when \u201c \u2018the exigencies of the\nsituation\u2019 make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is\nobjectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Mincey v. Arizona (1978) 437\nU.S. 385, 394.) \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is\u201d \u2019 one\nsuch \u2018 \u201cjustification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or\nemergency.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (United States v. Snipe (9th Cir. 2008) 515 F.3d 947, 950-951.)\n       We apply a two-pronged test to determine whether the exigent circumstances\nexception applies: \u201c(1) considering the totality of the circumstances, law enforcement\nhad an objectively reasonable basis for concluding that there was an immediate need to\nprotect others or themselves from serious harm; and (2) the search\u2019s scope and manner\nwere reasonable to meet the need.\u201d (United States v. Snipe, supra, 515 F.3d at p. 952;\nHopkins v. Bonvicino (9th Cir. 2009) 573 F.3d 752, 763-764.) Exceptions to the warrant\nrequirement \u201care \u2018narrow\u2019 and their boundaries are \u2018rigorously guarded\u2019 to prevent any\nexpansion that would unduly interfere with the sanctity of the home.\u201d (Hopkins, at\np. 763.) Accordingly, officers arguing the existence of exigent circumstances \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust\nbe able to point to specific and articulable facts from which he concluded that his action\nwas necessary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Ovieda (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1034, 1043; see also Welsh v.\nWisconsin (1984) 466 U.S. 740, 749-750 [police officers \u201cbear a heavy burden when\nattempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or\narrest\u201d].) Further, officers cannot rely on the exigent circumstances exception to the\nwarrant requirement where they \u201ccreate the exigency by engaging or threatening to\nengage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Kentucky, supra, 563 U.S. at\np. 462.) For example, in United States v. Lundin (9th Cir. 2016) 817 F.3d 1151, at page\n1158, officers stood on a house\u2019s front porch at 4:00 a.m. and knocked on the front door.\nThey heard crashing noises from the backyard, which they later asserted constituted an\nexigent circumstance, and they went around the house into the back yard. The federal\nappellate court observed that the officers caused the crashing noises by knocking on the\n\n                                             15\n\fdoor, and therefore they were required to show that they lawfully stood on the porch\nwhen they created the exigency. The court concluded that, while officers are entitled to\nencroach upon the curtilage of a home for purposes of engaging in a consensual\nencounter with the occupants, they exceeded their license to \u201cknock and talk\u201d because\nthey knocked on the door at 4:00 a.m. with the intent to arrest the occupant, not ask\nquestions. (Id. at p. 1159.) Because the officers were not authorized to be on the porch at\nthe time they created the exigency, they could not rely on the exigent circumstances\nexception to justify entering the backyard without a warrant. (Ibid.)\n       Conversely, in United States v. Ojeda (9th Cir. 2002) 276 F.3d 486, at pages 488\nto 489, the federal appellate court concluded the exigent circumstances exception did\nindeed apply where officers searched a rear building, where a drug laboratory was\nlocated, although they had only obtained a search warrant to search a house near the\nbuilding. The officers asserted that exigent circumstances existed because the suspects\nknew the officers were on the property, and their presence would have caused the\nsuspects to destroy evidence. (Id. at p. 488.) The court concluded the officers did not\ncreate the exigency, which would have precluded application of the exigent\ncircumstances exception, because the officers did not exhibit any intentionally evasive\nbehavior or act in deliberate bad faith; the officers had the right to be on the premises as it\nwas described in the search warrant, and the omission of the building from the search\nwarrant was inadvertent, not intentional. (Id. at p. 489; see also United States v.\nVonWillie (9th Cir. 1995) 59 F.3d 922, 926 [rule that government cannot create its own\nexigency does not apply where the government did not purposefully try to circumvent\nstatutory requirements].)\n       \u201c[T]he question whether exigent circumstances existed is generally one for the\njury. [Citations.] We can affirm the judgment, therefore, only if \u2018the underlying facts are\nessentially undisputed, and . . . a finder of fact could reach but one conclusion as to the\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fexistence of exigent circumstances.\u2019 \u201d (Lyall v. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2015) 807\nF.3d 1178, 1189.)\n       C. Analysis\n       Defendants contend that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry onto plaintiff\u2019s property\nwas excused by the exigent circumstances exception because they entered the property to\nstop plaintiff from obtaining the rifle and using it against them. They add that there is no\nevidence the officers were violating plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights at the time\nplaintiff began running for the rifle, and therefore they could not have created their own\nexigency. (See Kentucky, supra, 563 U.S. at p. 462 [availability of the exigent\ncircumstances exception depends on whether the officers were committing or threatening\nto commit a Fourth Amendment violation at the time the exigency was created]; United\nStates v. Lundin, supra, 817 F.3d at p. 1158.)\n       We disagree and conclude there is a triable issue as to whether the officers were\nviolating plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights at the time plaintiff began running for the\nrifle. In his deposition, plaintiff asserted that Knox was past the SUV and was \u201cprobably\nhalfway around [his] shop\u201d by the time plaintiff started to run toward the rifle.\nSpecifically, plaintiff said he saw Knox through the windows at the northwest corner of\nthe shop before he ran from the porch toward the rifle, while Clendenen said Knox\n\u201cheaded north and then east around the corner. And [plaintiff] came off the back porch.\u201d\n       A reasonable jury crediting this testimony could find that Knox had violated the\nFourth Amendment by leaving the public driveway and entering plaintiff\u2019s curtilage, in\nwhich plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy, before plaintiff began running\ntoward the rifle.10 (See Perea-Rey, supra, 680 F.3d at pp. 1185, 1186.) If this were the\ncase, the exigent circumstance exception would not apply to excuse the violation.\n\n\n\n10 We recognize that the trial court is required to determine the scope of the curtilage as\na question of law. (United States v. Johnson (9th Cir. 2001) 256 F.3d 895, 902; see also\n\n                                             17\n\f       Moreover, if Knox walked toward the rifle for the purpose of gathering evidence,\nrather than engaging in a consensual encounter with plaintiff, Knox\u2019s entry into\nplaintiff\u2019s curtilage would not be excused by the \u201cknock and talk\u201d exception. (See\nPerea-Rey, supra, 680 F.3d at p. 1188 [constitutionality of police incursion into curtilage\ndepends on \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s actions are consistent with an attempt to initiate\nconsensual contact with the occupants of the home\u201d]; People v. Lujano (2014) 229\nCal.App.4th 175, 184 [officers entitled to enter curtilage to engage in consensual\nencounter to confirm or dispel reasonable suspicion of criminal activity].) Further, if a\nFourth Amendment violation occurred, a reasonable jury could find that the incursion,\nwhich caused plaintiff to fear robbery and run for his rifle, proximately caused his\ninjuries.\n       Because we conclude there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Knox was\ncommitting a Fourth Amendment violation at the time plaintiff first ran toward the rifle,\nthe trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment.\n                                             III\n                                  Excessive Force Claim\n       Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by granting defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment as to his section 1983 claim of excessive force. We agree.11\n       Claims that police officers used excessive force in the course of an arrest,\ninvestigatory stop or other \u201cseizure\u201d of a free citizen are analyzed under the\nreasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\n\nUnited States v.

In other words, \u201c \u2018[t]he force which [i]s applied must be\nbalanced against the need for that force.\u2019 \u201d (Deorle, at p. 1279.) \u201c[I]t is the need for\nforce which is at the heart of the Graham factors.\u201d (Liston v.

Riverside, supra,\n120 F.3d at p. 977.)\n       A. Government Interests\n       In determining the government\u2019s interest in the use of force, we pay \u201ccareful\nattention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of\nthe crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the\nofficers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest\nby flight.\u201d (Graham, supra, 490 U.S. at p. 396.) \u201cThe most important Graham factor is\nwhether the suspect posed an immediate threat to anyone\u2019s safety.\u201d (Nehad v. Browder\n(9th Cir. 2019) 929 F.3d 1125, 1132 (Nehad).) Courts may consider other relevant\nfactors in evaluating the totality of the circumstances. (Mattos v. Agarano (9th Cir. 2011)\n661 F.3d 433, 441, 451.)\n       Here, it is undisputed that plaintiff was urgently running toward the rifle because\nhe thought he was being robbed, and there is little doubt he would have obtained it and, at\nthe very least, threatened Knox and Garrett with it. However, \u201c[s]ometimes . . . officers\nthemselves may \u2018unnecessarily creat[e] [their] own sense of urgency.\u2019 [Citations.] . . .\nReasonable triers of fact can, taking the totality of the circumstances into account,\nconclude that an officer\u2019s poor judgment or lack of preparedness caused him or her to act\nunreasonably, \u2018with undue haste.\u2019 \u201d (Nehad, supra, 929 F.3d at p. 1135.)\n       Additionally, we may consider an officer\u2019s failure to identify himself in\ndetermining whether the use of force was reasonable. (Nehad, supra, 929 F.3d at\np. 1138.) Defendants contend that whether the officers identified themselves is only\nrelevant in cases where the officers applied a very high degree of force. But if an\nofficer\u2019s failure to identify themself is relevant to whether the officer\u2019s use of force was\nreasonable, we may consider it. (See McKenzie v. Lamb (9th Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 1005,\n1010-1011 [plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of excessive force where plain clothes\nofficers burst into hotel room with weapons drawn, forced plaintiffs against the wall,\n\n                                             20\n\fhandcuffed them, threw them to the floor, and pressed guns to their heads while refusing\nto identify themselves].)\n       We agree that there is a material dispute as to whether the officers\u2019 earlier actions\ncreated their later need to use force. As we have set forth in detail above, they arrived at\nplaintiff\u2019s rural home in plain clothes and in an unmarked SUV for the express purpose of\nprovoking him into brandishing a weapon that they suspected he possessed illegally.\nThey did not identify themselves as police officers. As plaintiff stood on his porch\ncalling 911 due to the officers\u2019 suspicious behavior, Knox began quickly walking onto\nplaintiff\u2019s property toward the rifle. Plaintiff then ran toward the rifle, believing the\nofficers were planning to steal his property and possibly threaten his life. Knox and\nGarrett, interpreting plaintiff\u2019s actions as a threat, ran to cut off his path to the rifle.\nKnox only shouted \u201csheriff\u2019s office\u201d after causing plaintiff to run toward the rifle, and\nwhile aiming a gun at plaintiff\u2019s head from inches away. Plaintiff failed to immediately\nprocess that the men were law enforcement as he faced down the barrel of a gun. Then,\nin the one to two seconds that lapsed as plaintiff moved back so he could get on the\nground as Knox commanded, he was tackled from behind by Garrett and thereby injured.\nAs he was being arrested, he realized the men were law enforcement officers. It is not\nclear as a matter of law that the officers\u2019 earlier actions did not create their later need to\nuse force.\n       Moreover, a reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 failure to shout \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice\u201d until the last possible moment caused the exigency. Plaintiff was calling 911 to\nrequest law enforcement\u2019s help with the ongoing situation when Knox moved toward the\nrifle. The jury could find that, had the officers first identified themselves, plaintiff would\nhave complied with their instructions and been able to explain his understanding that his\nprior felony conviction had been dismissed under Penal Code section 1203.4. Indeed,\nthere is evidence that plaintiff was relieved when he learned that the men were officers,\nstating in his deposition that, while he was on the ground being handcuffed, he \u201ckind of\n\n                                                21\n\ffigured it out that [he] wasn\u2019t going to get killed.\u201d Similarly, after Clendenen saw\nKnox\u2019s badge as he ran, she \u201cfelt a little more comfortable knowing that he was law\nenforcement.\u201d\n       Further, the jury could also find that the officers, having already seen the rifle,\nlacked an additional covert investigatory objective that would require them to continue to\nconceal their identities until they had defendant at gunpoint.\n       Even if an illegal search did not occur, a reasonable jury could find that the\nofficers\u2019 use of force was unreasonable given their actions in trying to provoke an armed\nresponse from plaintiff, the role that Knox\u2019s act of moving toward the rifle played in\ncreating any exigency, and the officers\u2019 failure to identify themselves until they had\nplaintiff at close range gunpoint, one to two seconds before tackling him from behind.\n       There is also a triable issue as to whether plaintiff was resisting or seeking to\nevade arrest. (Graham, supra, 490 U.S. at p. 396.) Before Knox shouted: \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice,\u201d there is no evidence that plaintiff resisted or sought to evade arrest; he was not\naware that Knox and Garrett were law enforcement. Plaintiff testified he did not realize\nthat the men were officers until he was handcuffed on the ground. But even if plaintiff\nwere on notice that the men were law enforcement when Knox first said: \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice,\u201d a reasonable factfinder could find that plaintiff did not resist or seek to evade\narrest. He backed up to get on the ground immediately upon being ordered to do so by\nKnox, and he then was tackled almost immediately. A jury crediting plaintiff\u2019s version\nof events could find that plaintiff attempted to comply with Knox\u2019s command and did not\nattempt to reach for the rifle, reach for Knox\u2019s gun, wrestle with Knox, or do anything\nsuggesting resistance. After plaintiff was tackled, defendants contend that the officers\nstruggled with him to get his arms out from under his body and handcuff him. But\nplaintiff testified that he could not get his hands from underneath his body because the\nofficers were on top of him. A reasonable jury could find that plaintiff was not resisting\nand that instead he was trying to comply but was unable to move his arms.\n\n                                              22\n\f       Finally, the crime of which plaintiff was suspected here--unlawfully possessing a\nfirearm--is not a serious crime as the law defines it. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c).)\nWe recognize, however, that the severity of the crime at issue is of less importance when\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances, where the reasonableness of the officers\u2019\nactions largely depends on the officers\u2019 role in creating the urgency they were then\nrequired to use force to eliminate.\n       Defendants argue that this case is analogous to Godoy v. County of Sonoma (N.D.\nCal., Jul. 22, 2016, 15-cv-00883-WHO) 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 96159, an unreported\nfederal district court decision with no precedential value.12 There, the excessive force\nclaim was based on two plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that a knee was pressed into their backs\nduring handcuffing, one plaintiff\u2019s claim that an officer continued to point a gun at him\nafter he was handcuffed, and one plaintiff\u2019s claim that an officer pulled her hand in the\nwrong direction while she was being handcuffed. (Id. at p. *18.) The district court\nconcluded that an officer\u2019s use of a knee to restrain an individual can be part of normal\nhandcuffing procedure, and neither plaintiff alleged lasting injuries resulting from the\nknee in their backs. (Ibid.) The plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding a gun being pointed at\nhim was inconclusive at best, thus failing to raise a material dispute. (Ibid.) The court\nobserved that none of the plaintiffs claimed a gun was thrust or pointed at their face in\nclose proximity. (Id. at p. *21.) The plaintiff who claimed the officer pulled her arm in\nthe wrong direction was able to pull her arm away and voluntarily place it behind her\nback. (Id. at p. *20.) Finally, the court concluded that the officers were not able to\n\n\n\n\n12 We may cite and rely on unpublished federal district court decisions as persuasive\nauthority (Mendoza v. City of West Covina (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 702, 717, fn. 13;\nFutrell v. Payday California, Inc. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1433, fn. 6), and \u201cwe\nmay consider such decisions when determining whether a constitutional right was clearly\nestablished for purposes of our qualified immunity analysis\u201d (Mendoza, at p. 717, fn. 13;\nDrummond v. City of Anaheim (9th Cir. 2003) 343 F.3d 1052, 1060).\n\n                                             23\n\fobserve the plaintiffs for a significant period to determine whether they were armed, and\ntherefore it was reasonable for the officers to believe Godoy was armed and could pose\nan immediate threat to officers or others in a crowd that had gathered at the scene. (Id. at\np. *21.)\n       As we have discussed at length, the facts here are distinguishable from those in\nGodoy. Here a reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 need to use any level of force\nwas due to their own conduct. Additionally, there is evidence that Knox aimed a gun at\nplaintiff\u2019s face from eight or nine inches away. Moreover, not only did the officers have\nsubstantial opportunity to observe plaintiff to determine whether he was armed, the sole\npurpose of their operation was to provoke him to brandish a weapon. Accordingly, we do\nnot agree that the officers\u2019 use of force was analogous to Godoy.\n       B. Nature and Quality of Intrusion\n       Evaluating the nature of the intrusion requires an assessment of \u201c \u2018the type and\namount of force inflicted.\u2019 \u201d (Deorle v. Rutherford, supra, 272 F.3d at p. 1279.) The\namount of force used may be excessive even where some force is justified. (Glenn v.\nWashington County, supra, 673 F.3d at p. 871.) \u201cIn evaluating reasonableness, we may\nconsider the presence and severity of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but injuries are not required.\u201d\n(Cortesluna v. Leon (9th Cir. 2020) 979 F.3d 645, 653-654; see also Floyd v. Laws (9th\nCir. 1991) 929 F.2d 1390, 1402-1403 [court may award nominal damages where a jury\nfinds for plaintiff on excessive force claim but awards no damages].)\n       At summary judgment, the parties agreed to several undisputed facts related to the\namount of force applied by the officers: (1) plaintiff was faced with a gun pointed at his\nhead; (2) one to two seconds later, Garrett hit plaintiff from behind and threw him to the\nground; (3) plaintiff went to the ground on his front side and blocked his fall with his\nhands; (4) when plaintiff was on the ground, either Knox or Garrett shoved his face into\nthe ground, and both Knox and Garrett were on his back; (5) plaintiff complained that his\nhands hurt because his handcuffs were too tight; (6) \u201cplaintiff did not break any bones as\n\n                                              24\n\fa result of the incident, and his claimed physical injuries consist [sic] \u2018right flank pain\u2019\nand an exacerbation of prior pain and injuries.\u201d\n       On appeal, plaintiff contends that the record contains evidence of \u201cphysical and\npsychological injuries\u201d he suffered in the encounter. The materials on summary\njudgment state that plaintiff suffered from PTSD, and he had chronic pain in his neck,\nknee, and back. He asserted that he suffered from nightmares, nausea, and anxiety\nattacks, and that he sought treatment for medical and physical issues, anxiety, and\ndepression.\n       Defendants urge us to not consider plaintiff\u2019s evidence beyond the facts agreed to\nin the undisputed statement of facts. We recognize that, \u201cwhere evidence is not\nreferenced, is hidden in voluminous papers, and is not called to the attention of the court\nat all, a summary judgment should not be reversed on grounds the court should have\nconsidered such evidence.\u201d (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank (2002)\n102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316.) But here, the trial court recognized that plaintiff stated he\nhad \u201cpains\u201d as a result of Garrett\u2019s tackle, and it concluded there was a lack of evidence\nof \u201cdoctors,\u201d or \u201canything else in there . . . which I would consider a fact which might\nassist in moving the matter to trial.\u201d In other words, the court concluded that a lack of\nmedical bills or other documentation supporting plaintiff\u2019s injuries supported summary\njudgment.\n       Crediting plaintiff\u2019s version of the events and incorporating our earlier references\nto the evidence, we conclude a reasonable jury could find that the officers used\nunreasonable force here by using any significant force at all. Additionally, even if some\nforce were justified to prevent plaintiff from obtaining the rifle, plaintiff testified he was\nattempting to get on the ground when he was tackled and driven to the ground after one\nor two seconds. Although we recognize plaintiff did not sustain severe physical injuries,\nunder the circumstances here we are unable to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s excessive force\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n                                              25\n\f                                               IV\n                                      Qualified Immunity\n       Defendants contend that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to\nplaintiff\u2019s claim of an unlawful search and his claim of excessive force. As we will\nexplain, we disagree.\n       A. Legal Background\n       Police officers and other governmental officials performing discretionary\nfunctions are entitled to qualified immunity, shielding them from civil damages liability\nas long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they\nare alleged to have violated. (Anderson v. Creighton (1987) 483 U.S. 635, 638.) This\nprotection applies regardless of whether the government official\u2019s error is a mistake of\nlaw, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.\n(Pearson v. Callahan (2009) 555 U.S. 223, 231.)\n       In Saucier v. Katz (2001) 533 U.S. 194, at page 201, the high court mandated a\ntwo-step sequence for determining whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity:\n(1) whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a\nconstitutional right, and (2) if the plaintiff has satisfied the first step, whether the right at\nissue was \u201c \u2018clearly established\u2019 \u201d at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct. The\nhigh court has since concluded that the Saucier sequence may be appropriate and\nbeneficial, but is not mandatory. (Pearson v. Callahan, supra, 555 U.S. at p. 232.) We\nfind the Saucier procedure appropriate and beneficial here. As we have concluded, there\nis a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether plaintiff has shown a violation of a\nconstitutional right; thus, we proceed to the second step of the Saucier sequence.\n       It is the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden to show that the contours of the right were clearly\nestablished\u201d at the time of the alleged misconduct. (Clairmont v. Sound Mental Health\n(9th Cir. 2011) 632 F.3d 1091, 1109.) In order to conclude that the right that the official\nallegedly violated is \u201c \u2018clearly established,\u2019 \u201d \u201c[t]he contours of the right must be\n\n                                               26\n\fsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\nviolates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified\nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful [citation];\nbut it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u201d\n(Anderson v. Creighton, supra, 483 U.S. at 640; see also White v. Pauly (2017) __ U.S.\n___, 137 S.Ct. 548, 552 [\u201c \u2018[C]learly established law\u2019 should not be defined \u2018at a high\nlevel of generality\u2019 \u201d and must be particularized to the facts of the case]; Hope v. Pelzer\n(2002) 536 U.S. 730, 741 [\u201c[O]fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates\nestablished law even in novel factual circumstances\u201d]; Clairmont, at p. 1109 [there must\nbe some parallel or comparable fact pattern, but the facts of previously decided cases\nneed not match precisely those with which the government official is confronted];\nRodriguez v. County of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2018) 891 F.3d 776, 795 [\u201c \u2018[T]he focus is\non whether the officer had fair notice that [the officer\u2019s] conduct was unlawful\u2019 \u201d].)\n\u201cOtherwise, police officers would escape liability for even the most egregiously\nexcessive uses of force simply because there was no case on all fours prohibiting that\nprecise type of conduct.\u201d (Mendoza v. City of West Covina, supra, 206 Cal.App.4th at\np. 712.) \u201c \u2018[W]hen there are disputed factual issues that are necessary to a qualified\nimmunity decision, these issues must first be determined by the jury before the court can\nrule on qualified immunity.\u2019 \u201d (Morales v. Fry (9th Cir. 2017) 873 F.3d 817, 824.)\n       B. Unlawful Search Claim\n       Defendants contend there was no clearly established law at the time of the incident\nthat would have put the officers on notice that it was a constitutional violation to enter the\nproperty to secure the firearm while plaintiff ran toward it. But those are not the\nundisputed facts before us here. If a jury were to credit plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts,\nwhere Knox entered the curtilage without a warrant and without exigent circumstances,\nthen the entry was an illegal search, and the law is clear in that regard. (See, e.g., Perea-\nRey, supra, 680 F.3d at pp. 1186-1187 [an officer may not trespass on the curtilage\n\n                                              27\n\fwithout a warrant, an exception to the warrant requirement, even to merely \u201cknock and\ntalk\u201d].) Accordingly, we cannot say as a matter of law that defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity based on the facts before us.\n       C. Excessive Force Claim\n       Defendants also argue the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to\nplaintiff\u2019s excessive force claim because there is no particularized legal authority\ndemonstrating that the officers were not permitted to apprehend plaintiff in the manner\nthat occurred here. We disagree.\n       The officers were undoubtedly on notice that the Graham factors required them to\nuse a reasonable amount of force under the circumstances in arresting plaintiff, and that\nthey generally could not unreasonably create the circumstances then requiring them to\nuse force. Additionally, multiple cases have recognized that an officer\u2019s failure to\nidentify himself can lead to the unnecessary and excessive application of force.\n       In King v. United States (6th Cir. 2019) 917 F.3d 409, at page 431, reversed on\nother grounds in Brownback v. King (2021) ___ U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 740, the federal\nappellate court concluded that police officers would not be entitled to qualified immunity\nif a jury found that the officers failed to properly identify themselves, in which case the\nplaintiff could not have sought to resist or evade arrest because he would not have known\nan arrest was being attempted. In that case, the plaintiff asserted he ran away from the\nofficers only after asking them if he was being mugged. The court concluded that, if the\njury credited the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, any reasonable officer would have known that\ntackling the plaintiff, holding him down, choking him, and beating him into submission\nwas unreasonable under the circumstances. (Ibid.)13\n\n\n\n13 Defendants contend King does not assist plaintiff because it was decided after the\nevents in question. But while the King decision would not have put the officers on\nnotice, the court in King concluded that clearly established law recognized a reasonable\n\n                                             28\n\f       Similarly, in Atkinson v. City of Mountain View (8th Cir. 2013) 709 F.3d 1201, at\npage 1212, the court concluded that an officer had \u201c \u2018fair warning\u2019 that charging at a non-\nresisting individual without first identifying himself as a police officer was\nunconstitutional in the context of an arrest.\u201d Defendants contend Atkinson is inapposite\nbecause the plaintiff in that case was \u201cbull rushed\u201d by an officer without provocation and\nwas in the hospital for three weeks. But the issue is not whether the level of provocation\nor the extent of injuries are analogous to the facts here; rather, the issue is whether the\nofficers were on notice that their actions were unconstitutional. Here, like in Atkinson,\nthere is a question of fact as to whether the officers acted unreasonably under the\ncircumstances. In Atkinson, the court observed: \u201cA reasonable officer in [the officer\u2019s]\nposition\u2014without either of the first two Graham factors [whether the crime was severe\nor violent, or whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or\nothers] justifying a forceful arrest\u2014would not have thought it appropriate to charge [the\nplaintiff] without first identifying himself as law enforcement and giving [the plaintiff] a\nchance\u201d to peacefully comply. (Atkinson, at p. 1210.) Similarly, here, a jury crediting\nplaintiff\u2019s version of events could find that the officers failed to reasonably identify\nthemselves and then tackled him before giving him an opportunity to peacefully comply.\n       In Vlasak v. Las Vegas (9th Cir. 2006) 213 Fed.Appx. 512, at page 514, the federal\nappellate court concluded that whether officers were entitled to qualified immunity\ndepended on whether they identified themselves as police officers. The plaintiff asserted\nthe officers did not identify themselves until after he was wrestled to the floor and placed\nin handcuffs. If the officers did not identify themselves, \u201cthey unnecessarily created a\n\n\nofficer would ordinarily inform a suspect of a low-level crime that he was being arrested,\nespecially where there is no reason to not inform him that he is being arrested. (King,\nsupra, 917 F.3d at p. 431, citing Atkins v. Township of Flint (6th Cir. 2004) 94 Fed.Appx.\n342, 349.) Accordingly, we cite King for the proposition that clearly established law at\nthe time of the events here recognized that a reasonable officer should ordinarily inform a\nsuspect that he is under arrest.\n\n                                              29\n\fsituation in which [the plaintiff] understandably resisted their efforts to subdue him, and\nin which their use of force was unnecessary and therefore excessive.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       We recognize that Knox did, in fact, shout \u201csheriff\u2019s office\u201d when he had plaintiff\nat gunpoint. But as we have discussed at length ante, this was only after encroaching\nonto plaintiff\u2019s property without explanation in a manner that caused plaintiff to call for\nlaw enforcement assistance, and then moving to seize plaintiff\u2019s gun, all without\nrevealing his identity as a law enforcement officer. This series of deliberate actions left\nplaintiff with little to no time to appreciate that he was being confronted by members of\nlaw enforcement, rather than thieves, in the one to two seconds before he was tackled\nfrom behind. Accordingly, we cannot say as a matter of law that the officers were not on\nnotice that their conduct was unconstitutional, and therefore we conclude the officers are\nnot entitled to qualified immunity.14\n                                              V\n                                      State Law Claims\n       Plaintiff contends that his claims for violation of the Bane Act, battery by a peace\nofficer, and assault survive summary judgment. We agree.\n       A. Bane Act\n       The Bane Act makes it unlawful for any person to interfere by threat, intimidation,\nor coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise\nor enjoyment by any individual secured by the Constitution or laws of California. (See\nAustin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 881-883.)\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper\nmeans (i.e., \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from\ndoing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do\n\n\n\n14 Plaintiff argues that we should abrogate the doctrine of qualified immunity. Based on\nour holding, we need not address that argument.\n\n                                              30\n\fsomething that he or she was not required to do under the law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Cornell v. City &\nCounty of San Francisco (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 766, 791-792 (Cornell).) An officer\ncannot claim qualified immunity under the Bane Act. (Venegas v. County of Los Angeles\n(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1240-1247.)\n        The Bane Act does not require that \u201cthe offending \u2018threat, intimidation or\ncoercion\u2019 be \u2018independent\u2019 from the constitutional violation alleged.\u201d (Cornell, supra,\n17 Cal.App.5th at p. 800.) Rather, where an unlawful arrest is properly pleaded and\nproved, \u201cthe egregiousness required by [Civ. Code] [s]ection 52.1 is tested by whether\nthe circumstances indicate the arresting officer had a specific intent to violate the\narrestee\u2019s right to freedom from unreasonable seizure, not by whether the evidence shows\nsomething beyond the coercion \u2018inherent\u2019 in the wrongful detention.\u201d (Id. at pp. 801-\n802.)\n        There are two requirements for a finding of specific intent. (Cornell, supra,\n17 Cal.App.5th at p. 803.) First, the court must make the legal determination of whether\nthe \u201c \u2018 \u201cright at issue clearly delineated and plainly applicable under the circumstances of\nthe case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) Second, if the first condition is answered in the affirmative, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe\njury must make the second, factual, determination. Did the defendant commit the act in\nquestion with the particular purpose of depriving the citizen victim of his enjoyment of\nthe interests protected by that . . . right? If both requirements are met, even if the\ndefendant did not in fact recognize the [unlawfulness] of his act, he will be adjudged as a\nmatter of law to have acted [with the requisite specific intent]\u2014i.e., \u2018in reckless disregard\nof constitutional [or statutory] prohibitions or guarantees.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.)\n        Applying this standard here, the rights at issue are plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights\nto be free from unlawful search and excessive force. As we have discussed with respect\nto qualified immunity in the context of plaintiff\u2019s unlawful search and excessive force\nclaims, these rights are clearly defined.\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\f       Defendants contend there is no evidence that the officers acted with specific intent\nto deprive plaintiff of the enjoyment of his Fourth Amendment rights. But as the\nappellate court reiterated in Cornell, supra, 17 Cal.App.5th at page 804, \u201cwhether the\nappellant officers understood they were acting unlawfully was not a requirement.\nReckless disregard of the \u2018right at issue\u2019 is all that was necessary.\u201d As we have discussed\nand based on the facts before us, a reasonable jury could find that the officers recklessly\ndisregarded plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.\n       Defendants also contend plaintiff\u2019s complaint based his Bane Act claim on the\nofficers\u2019 violation of article I, section 13 of the California Constitution; they argue this\nbasis restricts his claim solely to one of unlawful search rather than also including\nexcessive force. We disagree.\n       First, the use of excessive force constitutes an unreasonable seizure under article I,\nsection 13. (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 13 [\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects against unreasonable seizures and searches may not be\nviolated; and a warrant may not issue except on probable cause, supported by oath or\naffirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to\nbe seized\u201d]; Susag v. City of Lake Forest (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1414 [4th Amend.\nclaim of excessive force requires demonstrating unreasonable seizure].) Second, plaintiff\ndid not bring his Bane Act claim directly under article I, section 13 of the California\nConstitution. (See Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 360,\n392 [California Supreme Court has \u201cnot decided whether there is a private cause of action\nfor damages under article I, section 13\u201d].) Plaintiff alleged that defendants\u2019 conduct\n\u201cviolated Article I, Section 13 of the Constitution of the State of California and Cal. Civ.\nCode \u00a7 52.1. [sic] in that Defendants Knox and Garrett used the threat of force and or\nintimidation to violate rights secured by the U.S. Constitution and The California State\nConstitution.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, he alleged facts constituting a violation of the Bane\nAct and sought relief under that Act. (See Venegas v. Los Angeles, supra, 153\n\n                                                 32\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 1232 [declining to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1 claims against\ntwo defendants for violations of their rights under the 4th Amend. and Cal. Const., art. I,\n\u00a7 13].)\n          B. Assault and Battery by a Peace Officer Claims\n          As to plaintiff\u2019s claims for battery by a peace officer and assault, the standard for\nproving those state law claims is the same standard applied to section 1983 actions. (See\nEdson v. City of Anaheim (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1274-1275 [both \u00a7 1983 actions\nand state law assault and battery by a peace officer claims require plaintiff to demonstrate\nthe unreasonableness of the force used].) Because we conclude plaintiff\u2019s section 1983\nclaim survives summary judgment, so too must his state law claims for battery by a peace\nofficer and assault.\n                                         DISPOSITION\n          The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to vacate its ruling on\nsummary judgment and enter a new order denying the motion as to the following causes\nof action as to Knox and Garrett: (1) the first cause of action under section 1983 based\non unlawful search and excessive force; (2) the second cause of action for violation of\nCivil Code section 52.1; (3) the fourth cause of action alleging battery by a peace officer;\nand (4) the fifth cause of action for assault. Costs of this appeal are awarded to plaintiff.\n(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a).)\n\n\n                                                           /s/\n                                                     Duarte, J.\nWe concur:\n\n\n      /s/\nRaye, P.

The trial court granted\ndefendants\u2019 summary judgment motion in its entirety.\n        On appeal, plaintiff contends there are triable issues of fact as to two of his claims\nunder title 42 United States Code section 1983,1 whether Knox and Garrett committed an\nunexcused warrantless search that proximately caused his injuries and whether they used\nexcessive force in detaining him. He also claims error in the granting of summary\njudgment as to his state law claims for violation of his constitutional rights, battery by a\npeace officer, and assault. As we will explain, we agree with plaintiff, and shall reverse\nthe trial court\u2019s judgment in part and remand with directions.\n                              FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n        The following facts are taken from the evidence set forth in the papers filed in\nconnection with defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, except that evidence to which\nobjections were properly made and sustained. (Yanowitz v. L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567202\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567202/yanowitz-v-loreal-usa-inc/\">36\nCal.4th 1028</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037.) We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,\nthe party opposing summary judgment, resolving any doubts concerning the evidence in\nhis favor. (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n1   Further references to section 1983 are to title 42 of the United States Code.\n\n                                               2\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Property\n       Plaintiff, who was almost 66 years old at the time of this incident, lived at the end\nof Joint Road in Red Bluff, California.2 The maintained section of Joint Road, which\nwas a public highway, ended where it passed plaintiff\u2019s house. The county posted a sign\nreading \u201cRoad Closed\u201d at that point, and plaintiff strung a rope across the road to prevent\npeople from driving onto the closed portion of Joint Road.\n       Formation of the Officers\u2019 Operation\n       A real estate agent and his client moved plaintiff\u2019s rope to drive past the Road\nClosed sign to look for property. Plaintiff told them the road was closed. The client told\nthe agent he thought plaintiff had a handgun in his pocket. The agent called the\nDepartment to discuss the incident and to confirm that he had a legal right to use the road.\nThe agent did not specifically recall telling anyone at the Department what the client had\ntold him about the handgun, but he said he may have done so.\n       Hencratt shared with Knox his belief that plaintiff was a convicted felon who was\nprohibited from owning firearms, and he directed Knox to investigate. Knox and Garrett\nresearched plaintiff\u2019s criminal record using a database maintained by the California\nDepartment of Justice and discovered that plaintiff was a convicted felon, which they\nbelieved precluded him from owning, possessing, or controlling firearms. Based on his\nresearch, it also appeared to Garrett that Joint Road was a public roadway and not\nplaintiff\u2019s private property.\n       Knox did not interview the real estate agent or his client; the client later explained\nthat he had \u201cseen something\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s hand, \u201cpossibly a gun,\u201d but that it \u201ccould be\nanything.\u201d The client acknowledged he was at least 100 feet away, had bad eyesight, and\njust assumed that \u201cfor somebody to live somewhere in the country, they have to have a\n\n\n\n2 Plaintiff asserted that his property is in an unincorporated portion of Tehama County.\nThis dispute is not relevant to our analysis.\n\n                                              3\n\fgun.\u201d Knox and Garrett did not obtain a warrant to search plaintiff\u2019s property; Knox\nacknowledged they did not have probable cause to secure a warrant at that time.\n         The Operation\n         Knox and Garrett drove an unmarked sports utility vehicle (SUV) to Joint Road\nnear plaintiff\u2019s property. They dressed in plain clothes in order to conceal their identity\nas law enforcement officers; they intended to provoke plaintiff into brandishing a firearm.\n         Garrett walked toward the Road Closed sign. Plaintiff walked out onto his deck\nfrom inside his house, and he told Knox and Garrett that the road was closed and they\nwould be trespassing if they proceeded. Garrett returned to the SUV, and plaintiff went\nback inside his house. Garrett then walked to the rope, stepped over it, and continued\nonto the closed section of Joint Road. Knox and Garrett observed a chronograph on the\nnorth side of plaintiff\u2019s property, which they were aware can be used to measure bullet\nspeed.\n         Plaintiff left his house, walked through his shop located adjacent to his house to\nthe north, grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper, and approached the SUV to record its\nlicense plate number. Plaintiff then walked back to his deck, where he called 911 from a\nlandline.\n         Garrett and Knox decided to leave. They backed the SUV onto a driveway to the\nwest of plaintiff\u2019s shop; the driveway was on plaintiff\u2019s property but was used for public\npurposes, including package pickups and deliveries. The SUV was facing west, meaning\nthe driver\u2019s side door faced toward plaintiff, who stood on his porch to the south of his\nshop.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       Observing the Firearm and the Takedown\n       Garrett then saw a bolt-action rifle on top of a bench on the north side of plaintiff\u2019s\nshop, and Knox saw the rifle after Garrett told him about it. The rifle was unloaded, and\nits bolt was back, meaning it was not in a position to be fired.3 There was no one near the\nrifle at the time Garrett observed it.\n       Knox and Garrett got out of the SUV, Knox from the driver\u2019s side. Garrett\ntestified that they did not try to obtain a warrant at that time because \u201cat this time we\nwere there, and we decided that we were going to attempt to make contact with [plaintiff]\nin regards to the rifle.\u201d In his deposition, Garrett was asked: \u201cAnd what was the\nemergency that allowed you to enter [plaintiff\u2019s] property without a warrant?\u201d Counsel\nobjected, and Garrett did not answer. Following the objection, Garrett was again asked,\n\u201cWas there an emergency?\u201d Garrett responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe there was an\nemergency.\u201d4\n       While plaintiff stood talking to the 911 operator on his porch, Knox began\n\u201cwalking very quickly\u201d toward the back of plaintiff\u2019s shop, in the direction of the rifle.\n\n\n\n3  The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 objection to plaintiff\u2019s declaration providing\nmeasurements between the SUV and the rifle, and from where plaintiff stood to the rifle.\nPlaintiff contests this ruling on appeal and argues that witnesses are authorized to give\ntestimony estimating distances. But plaintiff asserted in his declaration that he later\nmeasured the distances, not that he was estimating. Because plaintiff did not provide a\nproper foundation for how or when he measured the distances, the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in sustaining the objection. (See Serri v. Santa Clara University\n(2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">226 Cal.App.4th 830</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852 [\u201cAccording to the weight of authority, appellate courts\n\u2018review the trial court's evidentiary rulings on summary judgment for abuse of\ndiscretion\u2019 \u201d].)\n4 The trial court overruled defendants\u2019 objection to this testimony, recognizing that\n\u201cthose words are in the deposition.\u201d But the court determined that Garrett\u2019s statement did\nnot refer to the time of the use of force, nor did it \u201ctend to prove an illegal search,\nexcessive force, nor to negate the claim of exigent circumstances.\u201d We discuss this\nruling, post.\n\n                                              5\n\fKnox did not identify himself as law enforcement as he moved toward the rifle. Plaintiff\nbelieved he was being robbed; he began running toward the rifle along the east side of the\nshop--the side facing away from the SUV.\n       When asked where Knox was at the time plaintiff started running toward the rifle,\nplaintiff testified that \u201c[Knox] was probably halfway around my shop by then,\u201d5 and was\n\u201cpast his vehicle.\u201d Plaintiff later photographed his view of the shop and driveway from\nhis porch, where he had stood while talking to the 911 operator. He was able to see\nthrough a large opening in the south wall of his shop to two windows in the shop\u2019s\nnorthwest corner. He had drawn a circle around the windows, and he testified he could\nsee \u201cKnox get out of his vehicle and start in a fast pace towards the back of my shop right\nhere (indicating).\u201d He then stated: \u201cAnd through these windows here where I could see\nhim half [sic].\u201d\n       After seeing plaintiff begin to run, Knox and then Garrett began running, still\nmoving toward the rifle.6 They observed what they believed to be ammunition near the\nrifle; they believed plaintiff could obtain and load the rifle, and they feared plaintiff\nmight fire it at them.\n       According to Karen Clendenen, plaintiff\u2019s girlfriend who witnessed the events,\nKnox exited the SUV, \u201cstarted to walk, and then he was walking pretty fast almost a\nrun.\u201d She recalled that as Knox began to run, \u201che pulled his jacket back, and I saw a\nbadge, so at that time I felt a little more comfortable knowing that he was law\nenforcement. And he took out his service revolver, whatever you call their guns, and he\n\n\n\n5 The trial court overruled defendants\u2019 objection to this statement; defendants do not\nchallenge this ruling.\n6 Plaintiff disputed this fact and asserted that Knox was already halfway to the gun\nbefore plaintiff began running. Plaintiff does not dispute that Knox began running\ntoward the rifle, as opposed to continuing to walk toward it, only after plaintiff began\nrunning toward the rifle from his location on the porch.\n\n                                               6\n\fheaded north and then east around the corner. And [plaintiff] came off the back porch.\nHe was standing on the back porch talking to 911 on the speaker phone because our\nreceiver doesn\u2019t work. And he ran off the porch around the barbecue and over to the\ncorner.\u201d\n       Knox reached the rifle before plaintiff, but he continued past it, turning the\nnortheast corner of the shop. As plaintiff approached the shop\u2019s northeast corner, Knox\ncame around the corner, aimed his service weapon at plaintiff\u2019s head from a distance of\neight or nine inches, and yelled, \u201cSheriff\u2019s office, get to the fucking ground, asshole.\u201d\nPlaintiff did not hear the words \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d He explained: \u201c[W]hen I seen that\ngun in front of my face, I didn\u2019t hear nothing. I was waiting to get shot. I was waiting to\ndie right there. And I thought I was going to get killed for somebody trying to steal from\nme.\u201d\n       Plaintiff started to back up so he could get on the ground. One to two seconds\nlater, Garrett tackled plaintiff to the ground from behind. Plaintiff went to the ground on\nhis front side and blocked his fall with his hands. His arms were pinned beneath his\nbody, and Knox and Garrett were yelling at him to give them his arms. Either Knox or\nGarrett shoved plaintiff\u2019s face into the ground. Both officers were on his back. They\ngrabbed plaintiff\u2019s arms, pulled them behind his back, and handcuffed him, leaving him\nlying face down in the dirt for \u201ca minute, minute and a half if not longer.\u201d Plaintiff\nrealized Knox and Garrett were law enforcement while he was on the ground being\nhandcuffed.\n       Plaintiff\u2019s Release and His Injuries\n       Plaintiff complained that his hands were hurting, and the handcuffs were too tight.\nThe officers informed him that he was a felon in possession of a firearm, but plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fasserted he had an expungement order he believed allowed him to possess rifles.7 Garrett\nmoved plaintiff from the ground to sitting on an ice chest next to the shop, loosening his\nhandcuffs after he repeatedly complained. Knox confirmed that plaintiff\u2019s conviction had\nbeen expunged. The officers removed plaintiff\u2019s handcuffs and left.\n       In his discovery responses, plaintiff asserted he experienced \u201c[n]ew right flank\npain, increased left knee pain, increased neck pain, increased lower back pain, and PTSD\n[posttraumatic stress disorder]\u201d as a result of the incident. In another response, he added\nthat he felt pain in his right lower rib cage area and right hip, and had experienced\nnightmares, nausea, and anxiety attacks. In response to defendants\u2019 separate statement of\nundisputed material facts, plaintiff agreed that he did not break any bones, and that as a\nresult of the incident, he claimed physical injuries of \u201c \u2018right flank pain\u2019 and an\nexacerbation of prior pain and injuries.\u201d\n       On appeal, plaintiff refers to his discovery responses, included in the record on\nsummary judgment, and asserts that Garrett\u2019s takedown injured his lower back, neck, hip,\nand knee and caused him to suffer from sleeplessness, nightmares, nausea, and anxiety.\nHe asserts he was prescribed medication and received medical treatment for both physical\nand psychological injuries. Defendants urge us to not consider this evidence; we address\nthat issue in our Discussion, post.\n       Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint\n       Plaintiff filed suit. His first amended complaint, which is the operative pleading,\nasserted causes of action against Knox, Garrett, Hencratt, and Tehama County. Plaintiff\nclaimed that all defendants violated his civil rights under section 1983, claiming as\nrelevant here that (1) the officers conducted an unlawful search when Knox walked\ntoward the shop and rifle; and (2) the officers used excessive force when they arrested\n\n\n\n7In 2003, the superior court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s felony conviction pursuant to Penal\nCode section 1203.4.\n\n                                              8\n\fhim. Plaintiff also alleged state law claims including a claim against all defendants for\nviolation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1) (Bane Act), and claims\nagainst Knox and Garrett for battery by a peace officer and assault.8\n       Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary\nadjudication as to plaintiff\u2019s claims, dividing the claims into 20 separate issues. As\nrelevant to plaintiff\u2019s claims on appeal, defendants argued the officers\u2019 entry onto\nplaintiff\u2019s property was excused by the exigent circumstances or emergency exceptions to\nthe warrant requirement, the officers\u2019 use of force was objectively reasonable, and, to the\nextent the officers committed any constitutional violations, they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n       Defendants also moved for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s state law claims.\nThey argued for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s Bane Act claim on the basis the\nofficers did not commit a constitutional violation, and as to plaintiff\u2019s assault and battery\nclaims on the basis that the officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.\n       In support of their motion, defendants submitted a separate statement of\nundisputed material facts, as well as deposition transcript excerpts, declarations, the\ncounty\u2019s use of force policy and search and seizure policy, the printout showing plaintiff\nwas convicted of a felony and the Penal Code 1203.4 dismissal order, and plaintiff\u2019s\nresponses to defendants\u2019 discovery requests.\n\n\n\n8 Plaintiff also alleged section 1983 claims on the basis that the officers: (1) conducted\nunlawful searches when Garrett walked past the rope across Joint Road, and when Knox\nand Garrett drove onto the driveway in front of his shop; (2) conducted an unlawful\nseizure by arresting him without probable cause; and (3) inflicted cruel and unusual\npunishment when arresting him. He also alleged state law claims against Knox and\nGarrett for false imprisonment and conspiracy. The trial court granted defendants\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment as to these issues and claims, and plaintiff does not\nchallenge those rulings on appeal.\n\n                                               9\n\f       Plaintiff\u2019s Opposition\n       Plaintiff filed an opposition to defendants\u2019 motion. He asserted the officers had no\nlegal excuse for entering his property, there was a triable issue as to whether the officers\u2019\nuse of force was excessive, and the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause they violated clearly established law. Plaintiff also asserted his Bane Act claim\nand other state law claims survived summary judgment based on the unlawful acts of the\nofficers.\n       Plaintiff responded to defendants\u2019 separate statement of undisputed facts and\nadded his own responsive material facts. He included numerous exhibits in support of his\nopposition, including deposition transcript excerpts, his declaration, incident reports\nwritten by Knox and Garrett, and defendants\u2019 written discovery responses.\n       Defendants\u2019 Reply\n       Defendants emphasized in reply that an exigent circumstance excused their entry\nonto plaintiff\u2019s property because the officers saw plaintiff run toward the rifle, and the\nlevel of force used by the officers was objectively reasonable. Defendants further\nreiterated that plaintiff\u2019s state law claims must be dismissed, and the officers were\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n       Defendants filed a response to plaintiff\u2019s additional undisputed facts, a reply to\nplaintiff\u2019s response to defendants\u2019 separate statement of undisputed material facts, and\nobjections to plaintiff\u2019s evidence in support of his opposition.\n       Trial Court\u2019s Ruling\n       The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion in its entirety. The court orally\npronounced its ruling and subsequently issued a written order containing only the ruling\non each issue. As relevant to the issues on appeal, the court concluded the emergency or\nexigent circumstances doctrine excused the officers\u2019 entry onto the property when they\nsaw the rifle; the court recognized that the officers believed plaintiff was a convicted\nfelon prohibited from owning firearms, they had a legal right and duty to arrest him, and\n\n                                             10\n\fplaintiff had \u201ctaken off running to the bench where a high powered rifle was located.\u201d\nThe court opined that the officers identified themselves and told plaintiff repeatedly to\nget down, and when he did not, they used reasonable force to take him to the ground.\nBased on these rulings, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion as to plaintiff\u2019s remaining\nclaims. Finally, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity,\nalthough its previous rulings had rendered that issue moot.\n       The trial court entered judgment of dismissal as to all defendants on May 9, 2019.\nDefendants filed notice of entry of judgment on May 31, 2019. Plaintiff timely appealed.\nThe case was fully briefed in February 2021, and argument was held at the court\u2019s\nrequest on June 17, 2021.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n                                    Standard of Review\n       On a motion for summary judgment, a defendant must show \u201cthat one or more\nelements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete\ndefense to the cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ.

Defendants respond that the undisputed facts\n\n                                             12\n\fdemonstrate that an exigent circumstance or emergency was created when plaintiff began\nrunning toward the rifle, giving rise to the officers\u2019 objectively reasonable belief that their\nsafety was in danger and excusing their warrantless entry onto plaintiff\u2019s curtilage.\n        As we will explain, we conclude there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to\nwhether the officers violated plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights before any exigent\ncircumstances existed, which would preclude the officers from relying on that exception\nto the warrant requirement. Accordingly, we agree with plaintiff that a reasonable jury\ncould find that his injuries were proximately caused by the officers\u2019 warrantless entry.9\n        A. Fourth Amendment Background\n        Section 1983 requires plaintiff to \u201cplead that (1) the defendants acting under color\nof state law (2) deprived plaintiffs of rights secured by the Constitution or federal\nstatutes.\u201d (Gibson v. United States (9th Cir. 1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">781 F.2d 1334</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1338.) The Fourth\nAmendment to the federal Constitution protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures . . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., amend. IV.) \u201cIt is fundamental that the Fourth Amendment\nonly protects from unreasonable searches \u2018those areas in which a person has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\u2019 [Citation.] Plainly, a private home is a place in which an\nindividual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. [Citation.] Land or structures\nimmediately adjacent to and intimately associated with one\u2019s home, referred to as\n\u2018curtilage,\u2019 are ordinarily considered part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment\npurposes.\u201d (People v. Williams (2017) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">15 Cal.App.5th 111</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120.) Searches and seizures\ninside of a home, or within the curtilage, without a warrant are presumptively\nunreasonable. (United States v.

Thus, while a warrant is not required to observe readily visible items within the\ncurtilage, and officers are not required to shield their eyes when passing by a home on\npublic thoroughfares (California v.

Exigency Exception to the Warrant Requirement\n       There are several exceptions to the warrant requirement. (Kentucky, supra, 563\nU.S. at pp. 459-460.)

Further, officers cannot rely on the exigent circumstances exception to the\nwarrant requirement where they \u201ccreate the exigency by engaging or threatening to\nengage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Kentucky, supra, 563 U.S. at\np. 462.) For example, in United States v. Lundin (9th Cir. 2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">817 F.3d 1151</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at page\n1158, officers stood on a house\u2019s front porch at 4:00 a.m. and knocked on the front door.\nThey heard crashing noises from the backyard, which they later asserted constituted an\nexigent circumstance, and they went around the house into the back yard. The federal\nappellate court observed that the officers caused the crashing noises by knocking on the\n\n                                             15\n\fdoor, and therefore they were required to show that they lawfully stood on the porch\nwhen they created the exigency. The court concluded that, while officers are entitled to\nencroach upon the curtilage of a home for purposes of engaging in a consensual\nencounter with the occupants, they exceeded their license to \u201cknock and talk\u201d because\nthey knocked on the door at 4:00 a.m. with the intent to arrest the occupant, not ask\nquestions. (Id. at p. 1159.) Because the officers were not authorized to be on the porch at\nthe time they created the exigency, they could not rely on the exigent circumstances\nexception to justify entering the backyard without a warrant. (Ibid.)\n       Conversely, in United States v. Ojeda (9th Cir. 2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776109\"><a href=\"/opinion/776109/united-states-v-steven-peter-ojeda/\">276 F.3d 486</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at pages 488\nto 489, the federal appellate court concluded the exigent circumstances exception did\nindeed apply where officers searched a rear building, where a drug laboratory was\nlocated, although they had only obtained a search warrant to search a house near the\nbuilding. The officers asserted that exigent circumstances existed because the suspects\nknew the officers were on the property, and their presence would have caused the\nsuspects to destroy evidence. (Id. at p. 488.) The court concluded the officers did not\ncreate the exigency, which would have precluded application of the exigent\ncircumstances exception, because the officers did not exhibit any intentionally evasive\nbehavior or act in deliberate bad faith; the officers had the right to be on the premises as it\nwas described in the search warrant, and the omission of the building from the search\nwarrant was inadvertent, not intentional.

Analysis\n       Defendants contend that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry onto plaintiff\u2019s property\nwas excused by the exigent circumstances exception because they entered the property to\nstop plaintiff from obtaining the rifle and using it against them. They add that there is no\nevidence the officers were violating plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights at the time\nplaintiff began running for the rifle, and therefore they could not have created their own\nexigency. (See Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"216733\"><a href=\"/opinion/216733/kentucky-v-king/\">supra, 563</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> U.S. at p. 462 [availability of the exigent\ncircumstances exception depends on whether the officers were committing or threatening\nto commit a Fourth Amendment violation at the time the exigency was created]; United\nStates v. Lundin, supra, 817 F.3d at p. 1158.)\n       We disagree and conclude there is a triable issue as to whether the officers were\nviolating plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights at the time plaintiff began running for the\nrifle. In his deposition, plaintiff asserted that Knox was past the SUV and was \u201cprobably\nhalfway around [his] shop\u201d by the time plaintiff started to run toward the rifle.\nSpecifically, plaintiff said he saw Knox through the windows at the northwest corner of\nthe shop before he ran from the porch toward the rifle, while Clendenen said Knox\n\u201cheaded north and then east around the corner. And [plaintiff] came off the back porch.\u201d\n       A reasonable jury crediting this testimony could find that Knox had violated the\nFourth Amendment by leaving the public driveway and entering plaintiff\u2019s curtilage, in\nwhich plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy, before plaintiff began running\ntoward the rifle.10 (See Perea-Rey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801335\"><a href=\"/opinion/801335/united-states-v-perea-rey/\">supra, 680</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> F.3d at pp. 1185, 1186.) If this were the\ncase, the exigent circumstance exception would not apply to excuse the violation.\n\n\n\n10 We recognize that the trial court is required to determine the scope of the curtilage as\na question of law. (United States v. Johnson (9th Cir. 2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773999\"><a href=\"/opinion/773999/united-states-v-michael-johnson/\">256 F.3d 895</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 902; see also\n\n                                             17\n\f       Moreover, if Knox walked toward the rifle for the purpose of gathering evidence,\nrather than engaging in a consensual encounter with plaintiff, Knox\u2019s entry into\nplaintiff\u2019s curtilage would not be excused by the \u201cknock and talk\u201d exception.

Courts may consider other relevant\nfactors in evaluating the totality of the circumstances. (Mattos v.

However, \u201c[s]ometimes . . . officers\nthemselves may \u2018unnecessarily creat[e] [their] own sense of urgency.\u2019 [Citations.] . . .\nReasonable triers of fact can, taking the totality of the circumstances into account,\nconclude that an officer\u2019s poor judgment or lack of preparedness caused him or her to act\nunreasonably, \u2018with undue haste.\u2019 \u201d (Nehad, supra, 929 F.3d at p. 1135.)\n       Additionally, we may consider an officer\u2019s failure to identify himself in\ndetermining whether the use of force was reasonable. (Nehad, supra, 929 F.3d at\np. 1138.) Defendants contend that whether the officers identified themselves is only\nrelevant in cases where the officers applied a very high degree of force. But if an\nofficer\u2019s failure to identify themself is relevant to whether the officer\u2019s use of force was\nreasonable, we may consider it. (See McKenzie v. Lamb (9th Cir. 1984) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">738 F.2d 1005</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1010-1011 [plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of excessive force where plain clothes\nofficers burst into hotel room with weapons drawn, forced plaintiffs against the wall,\n\n                                             20\n\fhandcuffed them, threw them to the floor, and pressed guns to their heads while refusing\nto identify themselves].)\n       We agree that there is a material dispute as to whether the officers\u2019 earlier actions\ncreated their later need to use force. As we have set forth in detail above, they arrived at\nplaintiff\u2019s rural home in plain clothes and in an unmarked SUV for the express purpose of\nprovoking him into brandishing a weapon that they suspected he possessed illegally.\nThey did not identify themselves as police officers. As plaintiff stood on his porch\ncalling 911 due to the officers\u2019 suspicious behavior, Knox began quickly walking onto\nplaintiff\u2019s property toward the rifle. Plaintiff then ran toward the rifle, believing the\nofficers were planning to steal his property and possibly threaten his life. Knox and\nGarrett, interpreting plaintiff\u2019s actions as a threat, ran to cut off his path to the rifle.\nKnox only shouted \u201csheriff\u2019s office\u201d after causing plaintiff to run toward the rifle, and\nwhile aiming a gun at plaintiff\u2019s head from inches away. Plaintiff failed to immediately\nprocess that the men were law enforcement as he faced down the barrel of a gun. Then,\nin the one to two seconds that lapsed as plaintiff moved back so he could get on the\nground as Knox commanded, he was tackled from behind by Garrett and thereby injured.\nAs he was being arrested, he realized the men were law enforcement officers. It is not\nclear as a matter of law that the officers\u2019 earlier actions did not create their later need to\nuse force.\n       Moreover, a reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 failure to shout \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice\u201d until the last possible moment caused the exigency. Plaintiff was calling 911 to\nrequest law enforcement\u2019s help with the ongoing situation when Knox moved toward the\nrifle. The jury could find that, had the officers first identified themselves, plaintiff would\nhave complied with their instructions and been able to explain his understanding that his\nprior felony conviction had been dismissed under Penal Code section 1203.4. Indeed,\nthere is evidence that plaintiff was relieved when he learned that the men were officers,\nstating in his deposition that, while he was on the ground being handcuffed, he \u201ckind of\n\n                                                21\n\ffigured it out that [he] wasn\u2019t going to get killed.\u201d Similarly, after Clendenen saw\nKnox\u2019s badge as he ran, she \u201cfelt a little more comfortable knowing that he was law\nenforcement.\u201d\n       Further, the jury could also find that the officers, having already seen the rifle,\nlacked an additional covert investigatory objective that would require them to continue to\nconceal their identities until they had defendant at gunpoint.\n       Even if an illegal search did not occur, a reasonable jury could find that the\nofficers\u2019 use of force was unreasonable given their actions in trying to provoke an armed\nresponse from plaintiff, the role that Knox\u2019s act of moving toward the rifle played in\ncreating any exigency, and the officers\u2019 failure to identify themselves until they had\nplaintiff at close range gunpoint, one to two seconds before tackling him from behind.\n       There is also a triable issue as to whether plaintiff was resisting or seeking to\nevade arrest. (Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\">supra, 490</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> U.S. at p. 396.) Before Knox shouted: \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice,\u201d there is no evidence that plaintiff resisted or sought to evade arrest; he was not\naware that Knox and Garrett were law enforcement. Plaintiff testified he did not realize\nthat the men were officers until he was handcuffed on the ground. But even if plaintiff\nwere on notice that the men were law enforcement when Knox first said: \u201csheriff\u2019s\noffice,\u201d a reasonable factfinder could find that plaintiff did not resist or seek to evade\narrest. He backed up to get on the ground immediately upon being ordered to do so by\nKnox, and he then was tackled almost immediately. A jury crediting plaintiff\u2019s version\nof events could find that plaintiff attempted to comply with Knox\u2019s command and did not\nattempt to reach for the rifle, reach for Knox\u2019s gun, wrestle with Knox, or do anything\nsuggesting resistance. After plaintiff was tackled, defendants contend that the officers\nstruggled with him to get his arms out from under his body and handcuff him. But\nplaintiff testified that he could not get his hands from underneath his body because the\nofficers were on top of him. A reasonable jury could find that plaintiff was not resisting\nand that instead he was trying to comply but was unable to move his arms.\n\n                                              22\n\f       Finally, the crime of which plaintiff was suspected here--unlawfully possessing a\nfirearm--is not a serious crime as the law defines it. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c).)\nWe recognize, however, that the severity of the crime at issue is of less importance when\nconsidering the totality of the circumstances, where the reasonableness of the officers\u2019\nactions largely depends on the officers\u2019 role in creating the urgency they were then\nrequired to use force to eliminate.\n       Defendants argue that this case is analogous to Godoy v. County of Sonoma (N.D.\nCal., Jul. 22, 2016, 15-cv-00883-WHO) 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 96159, an unreported\nfederal district court decision with no precedential value.12 There, the excessive force\nclaim was based on two plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that a knee was pressed into their backs\nduring handcuffing, one plaintiff\u2019s claim that an officer continued to point a gun at him\nafter he was handcuffed, and one plaintiff\u2019s claim that an officer pulled her hand in the\nwrong direction while she was being handcuffed. (Id. at p. *18.) The district court\nconcluded that an officer\u2019s use of a knee to restrain an individual can be part of normal\nhandcuffing procedure, and neither plaintiff alleged lasting injuries resulting from the\nknee in their backs. (Ibid.) The plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding a gun being pointed at\nhim was inconclusive at best, thus failing to raise a material dispute. (Ibid.) The court\nobserved that none of the plaintiffs claimed a gun was thrust or pointed at their face in\nclose proximity. (Id. at p. *21.) The plaintiff who claimed the officer pulled her arm in\nthe wrong direction was able to pull her arm away and voluntarily place it behind her\nback. (Id. at p. *20.)

(Id. at\np. *21.)\n       As we have discussed at length, the facts here are distinguishable from those in\nGodoy. Here a reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 need to use any level of force\nwas due to their own conduct. Additionally, there is evidence that Knox aimed a gun at\nplaintiff\u2019s face from eight or nine inches away. Moreover, not only did the officers have\nsubstantial opportunity to observe plaintiff to determine whether he was armed, the sole\npurpose of their operation was to provoke him to brandish a weapon. Accordingly, we do\nnot agree that the officers\u2019 use of force was analogous to Godoy.\n       B.

He asserted that he suffered from nightmares, nausea, and anxiety\nattacks, and that he sought treatment for medical and physical issues, anxiety, and\ndepression.\n       Defendants urge us to not consider plaintiff\u2019s evidence beyond the facts agreed to\nin the undisputed statement of facts. We recognize that, \u201cwhere evidence is not\nreferenced, is hidden in voluminous papers, and is not called to the attention of the court\nat all, a summary judgment should not be reversed on grounds the court should have\nconsidered such evidence.\u201d (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank (2002)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">102 Cal.App.4th 308</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316.) But here, the trial court recognized that plaintiff stated he\nhad \u201cpains\u201d as a result of Garrett\u2019s tackle, and it concluded there was a lack of evidence\nof \u201cdoctors,\u201d or \u201canything else in there . . . which I would consider a fact which might\nassist in moving the matter to trial.\u201d In other words, the court concluded that a lack of\nmedical bills or other documentation supporting plaintiff\u2019s injuries supported summary\njudgment.\n       Crediting plaintiff\u2019s version of the events and incorporating our earlier references\nto the evidence, we conclude a reasonable jury could find that the officers used\nunreasonable force here by using any significant force at all. Additionally, even if some\nforce were justified to prevent plaintiff from obtaining the rifle, plaintiff testified he was\nattempting to get on the ground when he was tackled and driven to the ground after one\nor two seconds. Although we recognize plaintiff did not sustain severe physical injuries,\nunder the circumstances here we are unable to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s excessive force\nclaim fails as a matter of law.\n\n                                              25\n\f                                               IV\n                                      Qualified Immunity\n       Defendants contend that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to\nplaintiff\u2019s claim of an unlawful search and his claim of excessive force. As we will\nexplain, we disagree.\n       A. Legal Background\n       Police officers and other governmental officials performing discretionary\nfunctions are entitled to qualified immunity, shielding them from civil damages liability\nas long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they\nare alleged to have violated. (Anderson v. Creighton (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\">483 U.S. 635</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638.) This\nprotection applies regardless of whether the government official\u2019s error is a mistake of\nlaw, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.\n(Pearson v. Callahan (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">555 U.S. 223</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231.)\n       In Saucier v. Katz (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">533 U.S. 194</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at page 201, the high court mandated a\ntwo-step sequence for determining whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity:\n(1) whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a\nconstitutional right, and (2) if the plaintiff has satisfied the first step, whether the right at\nissue was \u201c \u2018clearly established\u2019 \u201d at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct. The\nhigh court has since concluded that the Saucier sequence may be appropriate and\nbeneficial, but is not mandatory. (Pearson v. Callahan, supra, 555 U.S. at p. 232.) We\nfind the Saucier procedure appropriate and beneficial here. As we have concluded, there\nis a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether plaintiff has shown a violation of a\nconstitutional right; thus, we proceed to the second step of the Saucier sequence.\n       It is the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden to show that the contours of the right were clearly\nestablished\u201d at the time of the alleged misconduct.

Unlawful Search Claim\n       Defendants contend there was no clearly established law at the time of the incident\nthat would have put the officers on notice that it was a constitutional violation to enter the\nproperty to secure the firearm while plaintiff ran toward it. But those are not the\nundisputed facts before us here. If a jury were to credit plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts,\nwhere Knox entered the curtilage without a warrant and without exigent circumstances,\nthen the entry was an illegal search, and the law is clear in that regard. (See, e.g., Perea-\nRey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801335\"><a href=\"/opinion/801335/united-states-v-perea-rey/\">supra, 680</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> F.3d at pp. 1186-1187 [an officer may not trespass on the curtilage\n\n                                              27\n\fwithout a warrant, an exception to the warrant requirement, even to merely \u201cknock and\ntalk\u201d].) Accordingly, we cannot say as a matter of law that defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity based on the facts before us.\n       C. Excessive Force Claim\n       Defendants also argue the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to\nplaintiff\u2019s excessive force claim because there is no particularized legal authority\ndemonstrating that the officers were not permitted to apprehend plaintiff in the manner\nthat occurred here. We disagree.\n       The officers were undoubtedly on notice that the Graham factors required them to\nuse a reasonable amount of force under the circumstances in arresting plaintiff, and that\nthey generally could not unreasonably create the circumstances then requiring them to\nuse force. Additionally, multiple cases have recognized that an officer\u2019s failure to\nidentify himself can lead to the unnecessary and excessive application of force.\n       In King v. United States (6th Cir. 2019) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">917 F.3d 409</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at page 431, reversed on\nother grounds in Brownback v. King (2021) ___ U.S. ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">141 S.Ct. 740</span><pre class=\"inline\">, the federal\nappellate court concluded that police officers would not be entitled to qualified immunity\nif a jury found that the officers failed to properly identify themselves, in which case the\nplaintiff could not have sought to resist or evade arrest because he would not have known\nan arrest was being attempted. In that case, the plaintiff asserted he ran away from the\nofficers only after asking them if he was being mugged. The court concluded that, if the\njury credited the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, any reasonable officer would have known that\ntackling the plaintiff, holding him down, choking him, and beating him into submission\nwas unreasonable under the circumstances. (Ibid.)13\n\n\n\n13 Defendants contend King does not assist plaintiff because it was decided after the\nevents in question. But while the King decision would not have put the officers on\nnotice, the court in King concluded that clearly established law recognized a reasonable\n\n                                             28\n\f       Similarly, in Atkinson v. City of Mountain View (8th Cir. 2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">709 F.3d 1201</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\npage 1212, the court concluded that an officer had \u201c \u2018fair warning\u2019 that charging at a non-\nresisting individual without first identifying himself as a police officer was\nunconstitutional in the context of an arrest.\u201d Defendants contend Atkinson is inapposite\nbecause the plaintiff in that case was \u201cbull rushed\u201d by an officer without provocation and\nwas in the hospital for three weeks. But the issue is not whether the level of provocation\nor the extent of injuries are analogous to the facts here; rather, the issue is whether the\nofficers were on notice that their actions were unconstitutional. Here, like in Atkinson,\nthere is a question of fact as to whether the officers acted unreasonably under the\ncircumstances. In Atkinson, the court observed: \u201cA reasonable officer in [the officer\u2019s]\nposition\u2014without either of the first two Graham factors [whether the crime was severe\nor violent, or whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or\nothers] justifying a forceful arrest\u2014would not have thought it appropriate to charge [the\nplaintiff] without first identifying himself as law enforcement and giving [the plaintiff] a\nchance\u201d to peacefully comply. (Atkinson, at p. 1210.) Similarly, here, a jury crediting\nplaintiff\u2019s version of events could find that the officers failed to reasonably identify\nthemselves and then tackled him before giving him an opportunity to peacefully comply.\n       In Vlasak v. Las Vegas (9th Cir. 2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">213 Fed.Appx. 512</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at page 514, the federal\nappellate court concluded that whether officers were entitled to qualified immunity\ndepended on whether they identified themselves as police officers. The plaintiff asserted\nthe officers did not identify themselves until after he was wrestled to the floor and placed\nin handcuffs. If the officers did not identify themselves, \u201cthey unnecessarily created a\n\n\nofficer would ordinarily inform a suspect of a low-level crime that he was being arrested,\nespecially where there is no reason to not inform him that he is being arrested. (King,\nsupra, 917 F.3d at p. 431, citing Atkins v. Township of Flint (6th Cir. 2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Fed.Appx.\n342</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349.) Accordingly, we cite King for the proposition that clearly established law at\nthe time of the events here recognized that a reasonable officer should ordinarily inform a\nsuspect that he is under arrest.\n\n                                              29\n\fsituation in which [the plaintiff] understandably resisted their efforts to subdue him, and\nin which their use of force was unnecessary and therefore excessive.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       We recognize that Knox did, in fact, shout \u201csheriff\u2019s office\u201d when he had plaintiff\nat gunpoint. But as we have discussed at length ante, this was only after encroaching\nonto plaintiff\u2019s property without explanation in a manner that caused plaintiff to call for\nlaw enforcement assistance, and then moving to seize plaintiff\u2019s gun, all without\nrevealing his identity as a law enforcement officer. This series of deliberate actions left\nplaintiff with little to no time to appreciate that he was being confronted by members of\nlaw enforcement, rather than thieves, in the one to two seconds before he was tackled\nfrom behind. Accordingly, we cannot say as a matter of law that the officers were not on\nnotice that their conduct was unconstitutional, and therefore we conclude the officers are\nnot entitled to qualified immunity.14\n                                              V\n                                      State Law Claims\n       Plaintiff contends that his claims for violation of the Bane Act, battery by a peace\nofficer, and assault survive summary judgment. We agree.\n       A. Bane Act\n       The Bane Act makes it unlawful for any person to interfere by threat, intimidation,\nor coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise\nor enjoyment by any individual secured by the Constitution or laws of California. (See\nAustin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">149 Cal.App.4th 860</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881-883.)\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper\nmeans (i.e., \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from\ndoing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do\n\n\n\n14 Plaintiff argues that we should abrogate the doctrine of qualified immunity. Based on\nour holding, we need not address that argument.\n\n                                              30\n\fsomething that he or she was not required to do under the law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Cornell v. City &\nCounty of San Francisco (2017) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">17 Cal.App.5th 766</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 791-792 (Cornell).) An officer\ncannot claim qualified immunity under the Bane Act. (Venegas v. County of Los Angeles\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">153 Cal.App.4th 1230</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1240-1247.)\n        The Bane Act does not require that \u201cthe offending \u2018threat, intimidation or\ncoercion\u2019 be \u2018independent\u2019 from the constitutional violation alleged.\u201d (Cornell, supra,\n17 Cal.App.5th at p. 800.) Rather, where an unlawful arrest is properly pleaded and\nproved, \u201cthe egregiousness required by [Civ. Code] [s]ection 52.1 is tested by whether\nthe circumstances indicate the arresting officer had a specific intent to violate the\narrestee\u2019s right to freedom from unreasonable seizure, not by whether the evidence shows\nsomething beyond the coercion \u2018inherent\u2019 in the wrongful detention.\u201d (Id. at pp. 801-\n802.)\n        There are two requirements for a finding of specific intent. (Cornell, supra,\n17 Cal.App.5th at p. 803.) First, the court must make the legal determination of whether\nthe \u201c \u2018 \u201cright at issue clearly delineated and plainly applicable under the circumstances of\nthe case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) Second, if the first condition is answered in the affirmative, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe\njury must make the second, factual, determination. Did the defendant commit the act in\nquestion with the particular purpose of depriving the citizen victim of his enjoyment of\nthe interests protected by that . . . right? If both requirements are met, even if the\ndefendant did not in fact recognize the [unlawfulness] of his act, he will be adjudged as a\nmatter of law to have acted [with the requisite specific intent]\u2014i.e., \u2018in reckless disregard\nof constitutional [or statutory] prohibitions or guarantees.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Ibid.)\n        Applying this standard here, the rights at issue are plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights\nto be free from unlawful search and excessive force. As we have discussed with respect\nto qualified immunity in the context of plaintiff\u2019s unlawful search and excessive force\nclaims, these rights are clearly defined.\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\f       Defendants contend there is no evidence that the officers acted with specific intent\nto deprive plaintiff of the enjoyment of his Fourth Amendment rights. But as the\nappellate court reiterated in Cornell, supra, 17 Cal.App.5th at page 804, \u201cwhether the\nappellant officers understood they were acting unlawfully was not a requirement.\nReckless disregard of the \u2018right at issue\u2019 is all that was necessary.\u201d As we have discussed\nand based on the facts before us, a reasonable jury could find that the officers recklessly\ndisregarded plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.\n       Defendants also contend plaintiff\u2019s complaint based his Bane Act claim on the\nofficers\u2019 violation of article I, section 13 of the California Constitution; they argue this\nbasis restricts his claim solely to one of unlawful search rather than also including\nexcessive force. We disagree.\n       First, the use of excessive force constitutes an unreasonable seizure under article I,\nsection 13. (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 13 [\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects against unreasonable seizures and searches may not be\nviolated; and a warrant may not issue except on probable cause, supported by oath or\naffirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to\nbe seized\u201d]; Susag v. City of Lake Forest (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">94 Cal.App.4th 1401</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1414 [4th Amend.\nclaim of excessive force requires demonstrating unreasonable seizure].) Second, plaintiff\ndid not bring his Bane Act claim directly under article I, section 13 of the California\nConstitution. (See Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">11 Cal.App.5th 360</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n392 [California Supreme Court has \u201cnot decided whether there is a private cause of action\nfor damages under article I, section 13\u201d].) Plaintiff alleged that defendants\u2019 conduct\n\u201cviolated Article I, Section 13 of the Constitution of the State of California and Cal. Civ.\nCode \u00a7 52.1. [sic] in that Defendants Knox and Garrett used the threat of force and or\nintimidation to violate rights secured by the U.S. Constitution and The California State\nConstitution.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, he alleged facts constituting a violation of the Bane\nAct and sought relief under that Act. (See Venegas v. Los Angeles, supra, 153\n\n                                                 32\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 1232 [declining to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1 claims against\ntwo defendants for violations of their rights under the 4th Amend. and Cal. Const., art. I,\n\u00a7 13].)\n          B. Assault and Battery by a Peace Officer Claims\n          As to plaintiff\u2019s claims for battery by a peace officer and assault, the standard for\nproving those state law claims is the same standard applied to section 1983 actions. (See\nEdson v. City of Anaheim (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">63 Cal.App.4th 1269</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1274-1275 [both \u00a7 1983 actions\nand state law assault and battery by a peace officer claims require plaintiff to demonstrate\nthe unreasonableness of the force used].) Because we conclude plaintiff\u2019s section 1983\nclaim survives summary judgment, so too must his state law claims for battery by a peace\nofficer and assault.\n                                         DISPOSITION\n          The judgment is reversed with directions to the trial court to vacate its ruling on\nsummary judgment and enter a new order denying the motion as to the following causes\nof action as to Knox and Garrett: (1) the first cause of action under section 1983 based\non unlawful search and excessive force; (2) the second cause of action for violation of\nCivil Code section 52.1; (3) the fourth cause of action alleging battery by a peace officer;\nand (4) the fifth cause of action for assault. Costs of this appeal are awarded to plaintiff.\n(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a).)\n\n\n                                                           /s/\n                                                     Duarte, J.\nWe concur:\n\n\n      /s/\nRaye, P.

This     case   involves      a\n\ndispute over the applicability of a self-reported symptoms benefit\n\nlimitation provision to a long-term disability claim.              Plaintiff-\n\nappellant Rhonda Ovist is a participant in her employer\u2019s long-\n\nterm   disability     plan   (\u201cthe    Plan\u201d),     which    is    insured    and\n\nadministered by defendant-appellee Unum Life Insurance Company of\n\nAmerica and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 et. seq.                 Ovist, who suffers\n\nfrom   Chronic   Fatigue     Syndrome        (\u201cCFS\u201d),     fibromyalgia,      and\n\nassociated   symptoms    including     pain    and   fatigue,    was   granted\n\nbenefits under the Plan in 2011.         The Plan provides for a maximum\n\nbenefit period of 24 months for \u201cdisabilities due to mental illness\n\nand disabilities based primarily on self-reported symptoms.\u201d                Unum\n\nterminated   Ovist\u2019s    benefits     under    this   provision     (\u201cthe     SRS\n\nlimitation\u201d) in February 2015, after paying benefits to Ovist for\n\nabout 43 months.\n\n           Following an unsuccessful administrative appeal, Ovist\n\nfiled an ERISA action in the U.S. District Court for the District\n\nof   Massachusetts,    seeking   recovery      and   reinstatement     of   her\n\nbenefits as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.             The parties filed\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted\n\nUnum\u2019s motion but denied Ovist\u2019s cross-motion.            Ovist v. Unum Life\n\nIns. Co. of Am., No. 4:17-cv-40113-TSH, 2020 WL 1931755 (D.

This requirement, Ovist\n\ncontends, runs counter to the parameters of the SRS limitation, as\n\ninterpreted by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Weitzenkamp\n\nv. Unum Life Insurance Company of America, 661 F.3d 323 (7th Cir.\n\n2011). In Weitzenkamp, the court concluded that a nearly identical\n\nSRS limitation is applicable to \u201cdisabling illnesses or injuries\n\nthat       are    diagnosed      primarily    based    on    self-reported       symptoms\n\nrather than to all illnesses or injuries for which the disabling\n\nsymptoms are self-reported.\u201d                 Id. at 330 (emphasis in original).\n\nOvist further argues that the SRS limitation does not apply to her\n\nclaim under Unum\u2019s interpretation of the provision, since she\n\nprovided objective evidence of her functional limitations, which\n\nUnum unreasonably rejected.\n\n                  We   decline    Ovist\u2019s    invitation       to   adopt   the   Seventh\n\nCircuit          Court    of   Appeals\u2019   holding     in    Weitzenkamp,    concluding\n\n\n       A \u201cfunctional limitation\u201d is a \u201crestriction or lack of\n       1\n\nability in performing an action as a result of a disability.\u201d\nAmerican Psychological Association, APA Dictionary of Psychology,\nat https://dictionary.apa.org/functional-limitation. We use the\nterms    \u201cfunctional   loss\u201d    and   \u201cfunctional    limitations\u201d\ninterchangeably.\n\n\n                                            - 4 -\n\finstead that Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement is permissible\n\nunder this circuit\u2019s precedent and is consistent with a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the SRS limitation provision.          Further, we find\n\nthat Unum\u2019s determination that Ovist lacked objective proof of her\n\nfunctional   limitations   rests    on     substantial   evidence   in   the\n\nrecord, and is thus not arbitrary or capricious.           We accordingly\n\naffirm the entry of summary judgment to Unum.2\n\nI. Facts\n\n           Ovist began working as a sociology professor at Rollins\n\nCollege in 1999.   Her responsibilities included teaching, advising\n\nstudents, developing courses, grading papers, and researching and\n\nwriting.   In its claim log, Unum noted that Ovist began reporting\n\nand seeking treatment for \u201csevere fatigue and generalized diffuse\n\npain in 2003,\u201d and she was treated with narcotics and \u201cseveral\n\ncourses of antiviral agents.\u201d         Ovist\u2019s complaints of pain and\n\nfatigue continued over the years. Rollins College approved Ovist\u2019s\n\nrequest for short-term disability leave from January 9, 2011 to\n\nJune 1, 2011, based on diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome\n\n(\u201cCFS\u201d), cytomegaloviral illness, sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis,\n\n\n\n\n     2 The Secretary of Labor filed a brief in this case as amicus\ncuriae. In the brief, the Secretary supports placing the burden\non the plan, and not the plan participant, to prove the\napplicability of a benefit limitation, such as the SRS limitation.\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the Secretary\u2019s assistance in this\ncase.\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fand   parvovirus.     In   June     2011,    Ovist   applied   for   long-term\n\ndisability benefits under the Plan.\n\nA. Relevant Terms of the Plan\n\n            The Plan \u201cdelegates to Unum . . . discretionary authority\n\nto make benefit determinations under the Plan[,] . . . includ[ing]\n\ndetermining    eligibility    for    benefits    and   the     amount   of   any\n\nbenefits,     resolving    factual    disputes,      and   interpreting      and\n\nenforcing the provisions of the Plan.\u201d An individual is considered\n\n\u201cdisabled\u201d and eligible for benefits under the Plan when she is\n\n\u201climited from performing the material and substantial duties of\n\n[her] regular occupation due to [her] sickness or injury; and [has]\n\na 20% or more loss in [her] indexed monthly earnings due to the\n\nsame sickness or injury.\u201d\n\n            This    case   centers     on     Unum\u2019s    interpretation       and\n\napplication of the SRS limitation, a provision of the Plan that\n\nlimits the benefit period to 24 months for certain disabilities.\n\nThe SRS limitation provides:\n\n            The lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period\n            for all disabilities due to mental illness and\n            disabilities based primarily on self-reported\n            symptoms is 24 months.     Only 24 months of\n            benefits will be paid for any combination of\n            such disabilities even if the disabilities:\n            are not continuous; and/or are not related.\n\n        The Plan defines mental illness as:\n\n            A psychiatric or psychological condition\n            classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical\n            Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM},\n\n\n                                     - 6 -\n\f           published   by   the   American   Psychiatric\n           Association, most current as of the start of\n           a disability. Such disorders include, but are\n           not limited to, psychotic, emotional or\n           behavioral disorders, or disorders relatable\n           to stress.\n\n         And the Plan defines self-reported symptoms as:\n\n           The manifestations of your condition which you\n           tell your physician, that are not verifiable\n           using    tests,   procedures    or    clinical\n           examinations standardly accepted in the\n           practice of medicine. Examples of self-\n           reported symptoms include, but are not limited\n           to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness,\n           soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness\n           and loss of energy.\n\nB. First Review of Disability Claim\n\n           Ovist submitted her long-term disability claim form in\n\nJune 2011, listing CFS as the illness causing her disability.      In\n\nan accompanying Attending Physician Statement, Ovist\u2019s primary\n\ncare physician, Dr. John Hudson, confirmed that CFS is the \u201cprimary\n\ndiagnosis preventing the patient from working[.]\u201d     He also listed\n\nsecondary diagnoses of Parvovirus3 and fibromyalgia,4 along with\n\n\n     3  According to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cmost people with parvovirus\ninfection have no signs or symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they\nvary greatly depending on how old you are when you get the disease.\u201d\nFor adults, \u201c[t]he most noticeable symptom of parvovirus infection .\n. . is joint soreness lasting days to weeks.\u201d Mayo Clinic, Parvovirus\ninfection, at https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-\nconditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085.\n     4  According to the National Institute of Health, fibromyalgia\nis \u201ca long-lasting or chronic disorder that causes muscle pain and\nfatigue,\u201d and \u201c[t]he symptoms of fibromyalgia are pain and\ntenderness throughout your body.\u201d National Institute of Health,\nFibromyalgia, at https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/fibromyalgia.\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\fthe following symptoms: severe chronic fatigue, severe muscle and\n\njoint pain, dizziness, insomnia, depression, and \u201cunclear mental\n\nclarity, or brain fog[.]\u201d\n\n            The   following   month,     on    July   15,   2011,   Dr.   Hudson\n\ncompleted a detailed assessment of Ovist, in which he repeated\n\nmany of the same diagnoses and symptoms, along with acute and\n\nchronic sinusitis,     opioid withdrawal,          chronic bronchitis,       and\n\nvarious viral infections.        Dr. Hudson indicated that he referred\n\nOvist to Dr. Nancy Klimas, a chronic fatigue specialist, for a\n\nsecond opinion on CFS and fibromyalgia.\n\n            In an Initial Progress Note dated July 29, 2011, Dr.\n\nKlimas wrote that Ovist is \u201cvery disabled . . . with [symptoms]\n\nconsistent with CFS.\u201d         Dr. Klimas prescribed a sleep study to\n\ndetermine the presence of apnea and ordered lab tests for \u201cimmune\n\nactivation, function, [and] cytokines.\u201d\n\n            In August 2011, Unum sent letters to three of Ovist\u2019s\n\nphysicians\u2014Dr. Kent Hoffman, who treated Ovist for pain and opioid\n\ndependence; Dr. Klimas; and Dr. Cory Baill, a gynecologist who\n\nbegan    treating   Ovist   as   early    as    2002\u2014to     ask   whether   they\n\nrestricted Ovist from completing her work, which, according to\n\nUnum\u2019s    Vocational   Rehabilitation          Consultant,    involved      light\n\nphysical demands.      Specifically, Unum asked the doctors if they\n\n\u201crestrict Ms. Ovist from performing full time work [that includes]\n\nsitting up to frequently and standing/walking up to frequently;\n\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fexerting 20 [pounds] of force occasionally or ten [pounds] of force\n\nfrequently, and/or a negligible amount of force constantly to lift,\n\ncarry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects, including the human\n\nbody[.]\u201d     Each doctor confirmed that Ovist could not work under\n\nthe physical demands listed.\n\n            On September 1, 2011, Dr. Freeman Broadwell, a medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and found that she\n\nconsistently reported pain and fatigue and received treatment for\n\nthese symptoms from multiple providers over several years.                      Dr.\n\nBroadwell did not find, however, that the \u201cexistence, intensity,\n\nfrequency,       and    duration   of    chronic   pain    and   fatigue   [were]\n\nconsistent with the clinical examination / diagnostic findings.\u201d\n\nNor did he find from Ovist\u2019s work-up that chronic infection or any\n\nother physical condition could explain a level of impairment that\n\nrendered Ovist unable to work. Dr. Broadwell nonetheless concluded\n\nthat \u201c[d]ue to the consistency of [Ovist\u2019s] reports\u201d of chronic\n\npain and fatigue \u201ccorroborated by her providers and absence of\n\nevidence to the contrary, the [restrictions and limitations] of no\n\nwork are supported.\u201d\n\n            In a letter dated September 13, 2011, Unum approved\n\nOvist\u2019s    claim       for   long-term   disability      benefits   \u201cdue   to   the\n\nsymptoms related to [her] medical condition of [CFS].\u201d                Unum noted\n\nthat her file shows that she had \u201cconsistently reported and been\n\ntreated    for    self-reported      complaints     of    chronic   fatigue     and\n\n\n                                         - 9 -\n\fchronic diffuse pain,\u201d and added that the Plan \u201climit[s] [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nbenefits to 24 months due to [her] medical condition of [CFS].\u201d\n\nConsequently, Unum provided an end date of June 29, 2013 for\n\nOvist\u2019s benefit payments.\n\nC. Second Review of Disability Claim\n\n           During 2012 and 2013, Ovist\u2019s physicians and Unum\u2019s\n\nPersonal Visit Consultant documented the persistence of Ovist\u2019s\n\nconditions and symptoms. In a status update dated January 6, 2012,\n\nDr. Klimas observed that Ovist continued to have physical and\n\ncognitive impairments, and that her pain was a \u201cvery serious issue\n\n. . . requiring increasing levels of pain med[ications].\u201d                   She\n\nprovided   a   primary   diagnosis   of    immune    deficiency     based   on\n\n\u201claboratory testing demonstrat[ing] poor cellular function . . . ,\n\nproinflammatory cytokine expression, [and] serology consistent\n\nwith   viral   reactivation.\u201d    Dr.      Klimas    also   listed   secondary\n\ndiagnoses of fatigue and fibromyalgia.        On May 4, 2012, Dr. Klimas\n\nreported no improvement in Ovist\u2019s functional capacity and advised\n\nthat Ovist have \u201cunrestricted access to rest\u201d and \u201cavoid exposure\n\nto community acquired infections.\u201d\n\n           On May 14, 2012, Unum\u2019s Personal Visit Consultant, Mark\n\nCox, conducted a field visit with Ovist.           Cox noted in his report\n\nthat Ovist remained seated throughout the visit, and he \u201cdid not\n\nobserve the insured display any physical signs of pain / discomfort\n\nwhile she was seated . . . .\u201d          But Cox also found that Ovist\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f\u201cappeared tired and fatigued throughout the entire field visit,\u201d\n\n\u201cappeared to have some difficulty staying focused on the topics\n\nbeing discussed,\u201d and occasionally slurred her speech.            A couple\n\nmonths later, in response to a request for information from Unum,\n\nDr.   Hoffman   opined   that   Ovist\u2019s    diagnoses   were   chronic   pain\n\nsyndrome, fibromyalgia, and opioid dependence.         He maintained that\n\nOvist was unable to work.\n\n           Ovist\u2019s behavioral health issues also begin to appear in\n\nthe record during this time period.           Around August 2012, Ovist\n\nbegan seeing a clinical psychologist, Dr. Catherine Segota.             That\n\nsame month, Ovist submitted a form to the Florida Department of\n\nHealth, in which she reported experiencing daily panic and/or\n\nanxiety attacks that lasted from 15 minutes to hours.          Roughly one\n\nmonth later, on September 14, 2012, Ovist was awarded social\n\nsecurity disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) benefits retroactive to\n\nApril 2012.     The Social Security Administration determined that\n\nOvist was disabled as of October 26, 2011, with diagnoses of \u201cother\n\nunspecified arthropathy\u201d5 and \u201canxiety related disorder.\u201d\n\n           On July 19, 2013, Dr. Tony Smith, a medical consultant\n\nfor Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and wrote that multiple specialists\n\n\n      According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, arthropathy is \u201ca\n      5\n\njoint disease, of which arthritis is a type,\u201d and its symptoms\ninclude \u201cjoint swelling, stiffness[,] [and] reduced range of\nmotion.\u201d Johns Hopkins Medicine, Arthropathy, at\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-\ndiseases/arthropathy.\n\n\n                                  - 11 -\n\fdiagnosed Ovist with CFS, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain syndrome,\n\nthough \u201c[n]o specific etiology for the opined diagnoses has been\n\nestablished to date.\u201d   Dr. Smith determined that \u201cthe medical data\n\ndocumenting   Ovist\u2019s   consistent    complaints,\u201d      Ovist\u2019s   level   of\n\ntreatment, Dr. Hoffman\u2019s report of narcotic dependence, Cox\u2019s\n\ndescription of Ovist\u2019s lack of focus and slurred speech, and the\n\n2012 SSDI award \u201creasonably support[] a finding that Ms. Ovist may\n\nhave difficulty working in a sedentary or light capacity on a\n\nconsistent    basis.\u201d    He   added   that    Ovist\u2019s    \u201cimprovement     is\n\nreasonable and expected,\u201d and he suggested a follow-up with Ovist\n\nin 8-12 months.\n\n          Unum\u2019s claim log indicates that, on July 22, 2013, Unum\n\nnotified Ovist over the phone that her claim would undergo further\n\nreview and her benefits would continue, though the initial 24-\n\nmonth benefit period had passed in June.         Unum also conveyed to\n\nOvist that it still found that she was unable to work, but\n\nimprovement was reasonable and expected.        The following day, Unum\n\nnoted in the claim log that Ovist\u2019s file was transferred to the\n\nSpecial Benefits Unit CORE section, and the next steps were an\n\nannual telephone call with Ovist and a medical update in 12 months.\n\nOne year later, in June 2014, Ovist\u2019s file was \u201creassign[ed]\u201d from\n\nthe CORE to the \u201cComp.\u201d section, \u201cto hold\u201d the annual telephone\n\ncall with Ovist, \u201crequest records,\u201d review her eligibility, and\n\n\u201cdiscuss[] [] the SR[S] limitation.\u201d         Ovist asserts, based on an\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\faffidavit from an employee of Unum, that the CORE section manages\n\nclaims pertaining to conditions that are unlikely to improve, and\n\nthe \u201cComp.\u201d section \u201cmanages claims with great scrutiny.\u201d\n\nD. Third Review of Disability Claim\n\n             In August and September 2014, Unum reached out to Ovist\u2019s\n\ntreatment providers, Dr. Deborah Dube, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Segota,\n\nand Dr. Klimas, requesting updates on Ovist\u2019s conditions and\n\nfunctional limitations.      Dr. Dube, Dr. Hoffman, and Dr. Segota\n\nresponded to Unum in November 2014.        Dr. Klimas\u2019s response reached\n\nUnum after it completed its third review of Ovist\u2019s claim, and\n\nUnum considered it in its next review, as discussed further below.\n\n             Dr. Dube, who treated Ovist for fatigue, generalized\n\npain, and chronic sinus infections, stated that she was unable to\n\nprovide information on Ovist\u2019s functional capacity because her\n\noffice did not perform functional capacity testing.             Dr. Hoffman\n\nmaintained that Ovist\u2019s primary diagnoses were fibromyalgia and\n\nchronic pain syndrome, and her secondary diagnosis was opioid\n\ndependence.     He explained that Ovist was still unable to work\n\nbecause her \u201cmental and physical capacities are very time limited\n\nand easily exhausted.\u201d      Finally, Dr. Segota noted that she met\n\nwith Ovist on fifteen occasions in the previous two years, and\n\nthat   she    diagnosed   Ovist   with     major   depressive     disorder,\n\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress\n\ndisorder, and \u201cunspecified neurocognitive\u201d issues.              Dr. Segota\n\n\n                                  - 13 -\n\flisted sadness, rumination, hopelessness, sleep disturbance, and\n\nfatigue    as   \u201cdata   which    support[ed]\u201d    the   diagnoses,    and   she\n\nconcluded that Ovist was unable to work for an unknown period of\n\ntime due to the severity and chronic nature of her symptoms.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, on December 14, 2014, Unum consulted\n\nwith its legal counsel regarding any \u201cconcerns with possibly\n\napplying [the SRS Limitation] to dx [a diagnosis] which may include\n\n. . . fibromyalgia[.]\u201d         Counsel advised Unum that \u201c[t]here is no\n\nbinding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit that would preclude\n\napplication of the [SRS] limitation when fibromyalgia has been\n\ndiagnosed.\u201d\n\n            On December 30, 2014, Nurse Sarah Curran, a medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and agreed with Unum\u2019s\n\nreviewers who determined in \u201c2011 and again in 2013 . . . that\n\nthere was no physical basis to explain the etiology of [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nreported   complaints     of    extreme   fatigue   and   pain[,]    and   [her\n\nrestrictions     and    limitations]      were   supported   based    on   the\n\nconsistency of [her] complaints.\u201d            Nurse Curran also noted that\n\nOvist\u2019s physical exams \u201cremain unremarkable and there has been no\n\ndiagnostic testing performed to explain the etiology of [Ovist\u2019s]\n\ncomplaints.\u201d     Nurse Curran concluded that Ovist was unable to work\n\ndue to her pain and fatigue.       She added that, based on Dr. Segota\u2019s\n\nreport, Ovist was also functionally impaired \u201cfrom a [behavioral\n\nhealth] perspective\u201d beginning in July 2012.\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\f            A   couple   weeks      later,    Dr.    Bryan   Hauser,    a   medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and consulted Dr.\n\nHoffman.    Based on that review, he agreed that Ovist was unable to\n\nwork due to the same \u201cnon-verifiable medical conditions.\u201d\n\n            In a letter dated February 17, 2015, Unum notified Ovist\n\nthat,   after     reviewing    updated       information     in   her   file,   its\n\ndetermination from 2011 remained in place\u2014Ovist was unable to work\n\ndue to CFS and fibromyalgia, and the SRS limitation applied to her\n\nclaim. Unum explained that Ovist\u2019s diagnoses \u201care considered self-\n\nreported,\u201d as they \u201ccannot be verified or confirmed by physical\n\nexamination findings that are not dependent on [Ovist\u2019s] report\n\nand cannot be verified by diagnostic test findings.\u201d                    Unum also\n\nrepeated its prior finding that Ovist\u2019s \u201cphysical examinations\n\nremain unremarkable,\u201d and \u201c[t]here had been no diagnostic testing\n\nperformed    to   explain     the    etiology       of   [Ovist\u2019s]   complaints.\u201d\n\nFinally, Unum noted that Ovist was functionally impaired from a\n\nbehavioral health perspective since July 2012, but since Ovist\u2019s\n\nmaximum benefit period had already been exhausted in June 2013 due\n\nto her conditions of CFS and fibromyalgia, Unum could \u201cno longer\n\nconsider conditions or symptoms based on either behavioral health\n\nor self-reported symptoms.\u201d            Ovist\u2019s final benefit payment was\n\nscheduled for the following day, February 18, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fE. Fourth Review of Disability Claim\n\n              Dr. Klimas responded to Ovist\u2019s 2014 request for updates\n\nin a letter dated February 24, 2015; this letter initiated a fourth\n\nround of review of Ovist\u2019s claim.                 In her letter, Dr. Klimas\n\nasserted that Ovist was unable to work, and her symptoms included\n\nfatigue,      pain,    cognitive     dysfunction,    sleep    disturbance,    and\n\nheadaches.      Dr. Klimas listed diagnoses of CFS, Immune Deficiency\n\nSyndrome, Myalgia, Orthostatic hypotension, and sleep disturbance,\n\nand she noted that water and mold damage in Ovist\u2019s home \u201cprobably\n\ncontributed to the worsening of her health.\u201d                 She added that her\n\nfindings were \u201cconfirmed by physical examination, medical history,\n\nand       laboratory    data     .    .   .     show[ing]     impaired   immune\n\nfunction . . . and latent virus reactivations.\u201d\n\n              According to the claim log, Unum tried to contact Dr.\n\nKlimas multiple times in March 2015 \u201cto clarify the etiologies of\n\n[Ovist\u2019s] impairing symptoms and the basis for the diagnosis of\n\n[the] conditions\u201d Klimas listed.                Dr. Klimas\u2019s response, dated\n\nJune 12, 2015, was considered by Unum\u2019s Appeals Committee.6\n\n              On April 14, 2015, Dr. Hauser reviewed Ovist\u2019s file\n\nagain.      He disagreed with Dr. Klimas\u2019s \u201cassertion that [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nimpairing      symptoms    are     attributable     to   (either   directly   or\n\n\n      6Unum added Dr. Klimas\u2019s June 2015 statement to Ovist\u2019s claim\nfile on July 17, 2015. The content and opinions that Dr. Klimas\u2019s\nexpressed in her June 2015 statement were similar to those\nexpressed in her February 2015 letter to Unum.\n\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\findirectly)   viral   infection,    immune    deficiency,    or    any   other\n\nverifiable (through physical examination or diagnostic testing)\n\nmedical condition.\u201d      He also noted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s tests for\n\nviral infection only provided \u201cevidence of past (and not acute or\n\nongoing)\u201d infection.       Overall, Dr. Hauser         came to a similar\n\nconclusion regarding Ovist\u2019s claim as he did the previous year\u2014\n\nthat Ovist was unable to work due to fatigue, pain, and depression,\n\nand   these   symptoms    were    attributed      to   diagnoses    of   CFS,\n\nfibromyalgia, and depression, which were not objectively verified.\n\nWith respect to fibromyalgia, Dr. Hauser stated that Ovist\u2019s\n\ndiagnosis     \u201cis     supported     by      the    history    of     chronic\n\ngeneralized . . . pain and the finding of at least 11 [of] 18\n\nfibromyalgia tender points.\u201d         He elaborated on the subjective\n\nnature of the tender point examination, noting that, during the\n\nexamination, \u201cpain elicited by the application of pressure by the\n\nexaminer (i.e., tenderness) is experienced and reported by the\n\nexaminee; its existence cannot be verified.\u201d\n\n            A couple days later, Unum medical consultant Dr. James\n\nBress completed an independent analysis of Ovist\u2019s file. Dr. Bress\n\nagreed that Ovist was unable to work, and he identified that Dr.\n\nKlimas was the only treatment provider to state that Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional loss was \u201c[due to] verifiable medical problems,\u201d namely\n\nimmune impairment and latent virus reactivations. Like Dr. Hauser,\n\nDr. Bress disagreed with this aspect of Dr. Klimas\u2019s opinion.               He\n\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fdetermined that Dr. Klimas\u2019s finding was not supported by any\n\nevidence, and that the tests Dr. Klimas administered to assess\n\nimmune function and viruses were not \u201cstandard medical testing\u201d\n\nand/or had no confirmed association with Ovist\u2019s symptoms.\n\n              Unum sent Ovist a letter dated April 17, 2015, stating\n\nthat it maintained its decision to terminate her benefits under\n\nthe SRS limitation as of February 18, 2015.           Unum explained that\n\nOvist   was    functionally   impaired   based   on   the   non-verifiable\n\nconditions of CFS, fibromyalgia, and depression.            Unum added that\n\nthe diagnoses were \u201csupported in part\u201d by Ovist\u2019s repeated reports\n\nof pain and fatigue, as well as \u201cthe finding of at least 11/18\n\nfibromyalgia tender points.\u201d\n\n              On June 15, 2015, Ovist sent Unum a fungal report and a\n\nNovember 2013 mold analysis of her home.         Dr. Hauser and Dr. Bress\n\neach reviewed the documentation and concluded that it did not\n\nchange their prior conclusions, as there is no proven association\n\nbetween mold contamination or elevated fungal spores and Ovist\u2019s\n\nsymptoms or diagnoses.         Accordingly, on July 14, 2015, Unum\n\ninformed Ovist that its benefits determination and supporting\n\nrationale remained the same.\n\nF. Ovist\u2019s Administrative Appeal\n\n              Ovist appealed Unum\u2019s decision in a letter dated July 4,\n\n2015.   Unum defined the \u201cmedical question\u201d on appeal as whether\n\n\u201cthe records support functional loss and/or [restrictions and\n\n\n                                 - 18 -\n\flimitations] due to physical medical condition/symptoms that are\n\nverifiable using tests, procedures or clinical examinations as of\n\n[February 17, 2015]         forward[.]\u201d\n\n            Ovist submitted additional information for review on\n\nappeal\u2014office notes from a gastrointestinal specialist from May\n\n2013; office notes from Dr. Hoffman from January to July 2015;\n\nrecords and diagnostic test results from primary care physician\n\nDr. Dube and cardiologist Dr. Potts from January and February 2015;\n\nand records and lab reports from Dr. Klimas from February and March\n\n2015.       Ovist    also     provided       Unum    with     the    results       of   a\n\nCardiopulmonary       Exercise      Test    (\u201cCPET\u201d)       conducted    by   exercise\n\nphysiologist Jeffrey Cournoyer on September 24-25, 2015.                      The CPET\n\nis designed \u201cto determine functional capacity and assess the\n\nrecovery response to a standardized physical stressor.\u201d7\n\n            In    his     report,    Cournoyer       explained      that     the    CPET\n\nconsisted    of     two   identical    tests        that    were    administered        on\n\nconsecutive days, in order to \u201cestablish changes in work function\n\ncapacity.\u201d        Cournoyer    noted       that   Ovist     \u201cdemonstrated      maximal\n\n\n\n\n     7 According to Massachusetts General Hospital, \u201c[t]he primary\npurpose of . . . [CPET] is to carefully assess how your lungs,\nheart, blood vessels and muscles perform during an exercise\nchallenge. . . . CPET is used to define how conditions that affect\nheart, lung, blood vessel or muscle function contribute to exercise\nintolerance.

He\n\nalso found that Ovist\u2019s metabolic responses indicated \u201ca higher\n\nprobability of running out of energy\u201d on the second day; her\n\n\u201c[b]reathing values showed more strain\u201d on the second day; and her\n\n\u201cwattage at maximal effort\u201d on both days was \u201cpathologically low.\u201d\n\nSeemingly consistent with this, Cournoyer observed that Ovist left\n\nthe office fatigued on the first day of testing, but after the\n\nsecond day of testing, Ovist\u2019s \u201cposture and walking gait suggested\n\na severely weakened state, and [Cournoyer] was not comfortable\n\nwith allowing her to leave in that condition.\u201d        The CPET also\n\nincluded an element of cognitive testing.     Cournoyer found that\n\nOvist \u201cshowed the most drastic changes\u201d across the two days in her\n\n\u201cimmediate and delayed recall of simple information\u201d and in her\n\nconcentration.\n\n          Unum\u2019s Angela Malan-Elzawahry reviewed Ovist\u2019s file on\n\nJanuary 5, 2016.   Malan-Elzawahry detailed the medical conditions\n\nwith which Ovist had been diagnosed or for which she had been\n\nevaluated and/or treated, including infections, sinusitis, CFS,\n\nfibromyalgia, wrist pain, ankle sprain, shingles, thyroid goiter,\n\nchronic   pain     syndrome,   opioid   dependence,     depression,\n\n\n                               - 20 -\n\fcardiopulmonary     conditions,      left   knee    pain        and    related     joint\n\nissues, and mold exposure.              She also described the results of\n\nvarious laboratory or diagnostic tests administered to Ovist,\n\nwhich she found to be unremarkable.           According to Malan-Elzawahry,\n\ntests for viral illnesses, which were repeatedly administered to\n\nOvist beginning in 2006, had not provided evidence of current\n\ninfection; a 2012 sleep study did not \u201cidentify sleep apnea at a\n\nseverity to be expected to cause the level of fatigue that [Ovist]\n\nhas   reported\u201d;    and   a   2015      cardiac    evaluation          did   not   show\n\n\u201crestrictions and limitations . . . related to a cardiopulmonary\n\ncondition[.]\u201d\n\n             Malan-Elzawahry      concluded        that     Ovist       consistently\n\nreported     worsening    pain    and     fatigue,        but     the    \u201cconditions\n\nidentified by testing, such as thyroid goiter, a joint effusion,\n\nand anterior cardiac wall soft tissue attenuation [were] not\n\ncorrelating with symptoms that are at a severity to limit [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nfunction,\u201d nor were they \u201cexpected to generate the fatigue and\n\ngeneralized pain symptoms reported by [Ovist].\u201d                       Malan-Elzawahry\n\ndeferred to Unum\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Scott Norris, for\n\nfurther, independent analysis of the appeal.\n\n             On January 21, 2016, Dr. Norris concluded that Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional     limitations       were     \u201cbased    on      [Ovist\u2019s]        reported\n\n[symptoms]    and   [were]     not   consistent      with        the    minimal     and\n\nnonspecific findings documented on examinations or the diagnostic\n\n\n                                     - 21 -\n\ftesting/imaging    studies       included     in     the   file   records.\u201d        He\n\nelaborated on this conclusion, noting, for example, that \u201cmultiple\n\nlaboratory     tests     were    negative      for     infections,       metabolic,\n\nimmunologic, hematologic, inflammatory, or other verifiable causes\n\nof   [Ovist\u2019s]   reported       fatigue\u201d;    Ovist\u2019s       \u201c[r]ecords    [did]    not\n\ncatalogue    examinations       or   testing       consistent     with    cognitive\n\nimpairment related to physical conditions\u201d; Ovist\u2019s February 2015\n\ncardiac tests were normal; and \u201calthough [Ovist] reported mold\n\nexposure in her home, the records do not reveal evidence of\n\nimpairment related to mold.\u201d\n\n            Finally, Dr. Norris expressed reservations about Ovist\u2019s\n\nCPET results. He wrote that the September 2015 CPET was not \u201ctime-\n\nrelevant regarding [Ovist\u2019s] functional capacity as of February\n\n2015,\u201d the date when Unum closed Ovist\u2019s claim.                 He also indicated\n\nthat Ovist did not \u201cexhibit maximal effort\u201d at certain points of\n\nthe CPET, meaning that \u201ca true . . . maximal aerobic capacity[]\n\nwas not measured.\u201d\n\n            Unum denied Ovist\u2019s appeal in a letter dated January 27,\n\n2016, concluding that the SRS limitation applied to Ovist\u2019s claim.\n\nIn the letter, Unum repeated Dr. Norris\u2019s conclusion that her\n\nreported     impairing    symptoms     and     her     functional        loss    were\n\n\u201cinconsistent with and/or not supported\u201d by clinical examinations,\n\ndiagnostic findings, or other objectively verifiable evidence in\n\nher file.    Unum listed examples: there was no \u201ccorrelation between\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\f. . . [the] environmental mold in [Ovist\u2019s] home [and] the severe\n\nillness     and   functional      impairment        being     reported\u201d;    Ovist\u2019s\n\ninfectious disease titers8 were \u201cconsistent with a past history of\n\ninfection    with      no   evidence   of       recurrent   infection\u201d;     Ovist\u2019s\n\ntemperature readings were normal; \u201cthe cardiology work up was\n\nnormal    with    no   findings   .    .    .    consistent    with    [orthostatic\n\nhypotension]\u201d;         \u201c[t]he   2011       sleep    study     was     negative   for\n\nobstructive sleep apnea\u201d; and \u201c[t]he records do not document\n\ncognitive impairment on exam,\u201d though Ovist\u2019s \u201csignificant anxiety\n\nand depression can increase her perception of poor concentration\n\nand/or cognitive dysfunction.\u201d\n\n            Unum further noted that Ovist\u2019s CPET was not time-\n\nrelevant, and \u201cOvist did not exhibit full effort on all tests.\u201d\n\nUnum asserted that \u201c[r]egardless of [Cournoyer\u2019s] findings\u201d from\n\nthe CPET, Ovist\u2019s \u201cfunctional limitation is based primarily on\n\nself-reported pain and fatigue.\u201d\n\n     Unum then concluded:\n\n            We do not refute [] your client\u2019s perceived\n            physical   and/or   functional  limitations.\n            However, we determined that any and all loss\n            of function is based on disability due to\n            mental illness and based primarily on self-\n            reported symptoms.

Procedural History\n\n          On August 2, 2017, following the adverse determination\n\non her administrative appeal, Ovist initiated an ERISA action in\n\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging\n\nthat Unum unlawfully terminated her benefits.   On August 30, 2019,\n\nthe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. A magistrate\n\njudge issued a Report and Recommendation on February 24, 2020,\n\nrecommending that the district court grant Unum\u2019s motion and deny\n\nOvist\u2019s motion.\n\n          In the Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge\n\nfirst determined that Ovist, as the claimant, bears the burden to\n\nprove that the SRS limitation does not apply to her claim.   Then,\n\nhe found that Unum acted reasonably, under the terms of the Plan\n\nand this circuit\u2019s precedent, when it terminated Ovist\u2019s benefits\n\nunder the SRS limitation based on a finding that Ovist\u2019s impairing\n\nsymptoms, such as pain and fatigue, were based on her self-\n\nreporting, as opposed to objectively verifiable diagnostic or\n\nother tests.   The magistrate judge relied, in particular, on case\n\nlaw from this court establishing that it is unreasonable for an\n\ninsurer to require a claimant to provide objective evidence of\n\ndiagnoses that do not lend themselves to objective verification,\n\n\n\n\n                              - 24 -\n\fbut an insurer can reasonably require objective evidence of a\n\nclaimant\u2019s resulting functional limitations.\n\n           In March 2020, Ovist filed an objection to the Report\n\nand Recommendation, and Unum filed a reply.     The district court\n\nadopted the Report and Recommendation in full on March 27, 2020.\n\nThis timely appeal followed. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\n           We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.   Arruda v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 951 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2020).   When the underlying plan affords the insurer discretion to\n\ndetermine eligibility for benefits, \u201c[a] federal court reviews an\n\ninsurer\u2019s termination decision \u2018under a deferential arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard . . . .\u201d    Cook v.

Co., 230 F.3d 415, 418 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n           Here, the parties do not dispute that the Plan grants\n\ndiscretionary authority to Unum.   The Plan expressly \u201cdelegates to\n\nUnum and its affiliate Unum Group discretionary authority to make\n\nbenefit determinations under the Plan,\u201d including \u201cdetermining\n\neligibility for benefits and the amount of any benefits, resolving\n\nfactual disputes, and interpreting and enforcing the provisions of\n\nthe Plan.\u201d   Accordingly, we will review Unum\u2019s benefit decision\n\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard, as the district court\n\ndid.\n\n\n                               - 25 -\n\f             Under this standard, \u201cwe need not decide what is the\n\nbest reading of the words in the insurance policy.\u201d                  Stamp v.\n\nMetro.

Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)). Importantly, a conclusion can still be supported\n\nby substantial evidence if contrary evidence exists.           See Boardman\n\nv. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 337 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).              In\n\nshort,   we    must   uphold    Unum\u2019s   determination   unless       it   was\n\n\u201cunreasonable in light of the information available\u201d to Unum.\n\nPari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 419.\n\n\n\n\n     9  In ERISA cases in which the plan administrator has\ndiscretion to make benefits determinations, we have variously\ndescribed the standard of review as review for \u201cabuse of\ndiscretion,\u201d \u201carbitrariness and capriciousness,\u201d and \u201csubstantial\nevidence.\u201d These terms are interchangeable in this context. See,\ne.g., McDonough, 783 F.3d at 379 (\u201cA court that undertakes abuse\nof discretion review in an ERISA case must determine whether the\nclaims administrator\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious or,\nlooked at from another angle, whether that decision is reasonable\nand supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                   - 26 -\n\fIII. Analysis\n\n            Unum approved Ovist\u2019s long-term disability claim in 2011\n\ndue to her symptoms related to CFS.     In its initial determination\n\nletter, Unum notified Ovist that her benefit payments would cease\n\nafter 24 months under the SRS limitation, which         applies, in\n\npertinent part, to disabilities \u201cbased primarily on self-reported\n\nsymptoms,\u201d including \u201cheadaches, pain, fatigue, . . . and loss of\n\nenergy.\u201d    Roughly 43 months later, in its final adverse benefit\n\ndetermination letter, Unum maintained that the SRS limitation\n\napplied to her claim because Ovist\u2019s functional limitations were\n\nsupported by her reports of pain and fatigue, rather than clinical\n\nexaminations, diagnostic findings, or other objectively verifiable\n\nevidence.\n\n            Ovist primarily challenges Unum\u2019s interpretation and\n\napplication of the SRS limitation as follows.     She argues that it\n\nwas unreasonable for Unum to require objective evidence of her\n\nfunctional loss after concluding that she was unable to work.     In\n\nthe alternative, she claims that she did provide the requested\n\nevidence\u2014her CPET results\u2014and Unum rejected the results \u201con the\n\nflimsiest of grounds.\u201d      Next, Ovist contends that the Seventh\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of a provision almost\n\nidentical to the SRS limitation, in Weitzenkamp, should control,\n\n\n\n\n                               - 27 -\n\fand the SRS limitation does not apply to her claim under the\n\nholding in Weitzenkamp.      We consider each challenge in turn.10\n\nA. Unum\u2019s Objective Evidence Requirement is Reasonable\n\n            To begin, Ovist contends that it was unreasonable for\n\nUnum to require objective proof of her functional limitations after\n\nconclusively determining that she was unable to work.                  This\n\nargument fails under settled precedent within this circuit, which\n\nwe revisit below.\n\n            We have repeatedly held that it is unreasonable for an\n\ninsurer to require objective evidence in support of diagnoses,\n\nlike fibromyalgia and CFS, which are not subject to objective\n\nverification.    See Denmark v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. Of Bos., 481\n\nF.3d 16, 37 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that it is unreasonable\n\nfor   an   insurer   \u201cto   require    objective   evidence   to   support   a\n\ndiagnosis of a condition that is not subject to verification\n\nthrough laboratory testing[,]\u201d and identifying fibromyalgia as one\n\nsuch condition), vacated on other grounds, 566 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Cook, 320 F.3d at 21-22 (finding it unreasonable for the\n\n\n       Ovist also challenges the district court\u2019s holding that she\n      10\n\nbears the burden to prove that the SRS limitation does not apply\nto her claim, arguing instead that the burden of proof lies with\nUnum. We need not decide this issue because it will not affect\nthe outcome of this case. Under the applicable standard of review,\nwe must determine whether Unum\u2019s decision is \u201creasonable and\nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d McDonough, 783 F.3d at 379\n(citing Colby, 705 F.3d at 61).       As discussed below, Unum\u2019s\ndecision passes muster under this standard, regardless of where we\nplace the burden of proof.\n\n\n                                     - 28 -\n\finsurer to expect the claimant to provide \u201cconvincing \u2018clinical\n\nobjective\u2019 evidence that she was suffering from CFS\u201d because there\n\nare no accepted laboratory tests associated with the condition).\n\n           In Boardman v. Prudential Insurance Company of America,\n\nhowever,   we    drew     a    distinction       between     requiring   objective\n\nevidence of conditions that do not lend themselves to objective\n\nverification and requiring objective evidence of the functional\n\nlimitations resulting from a claimant\u2019s conditions.                    337 F.3d at\n\n16-17 & n.5.     We held that the latter is permissible.\n\n           The claimant in Boardman presented varying diagnoses of\n\nconditions that are associated with pain and fatigue, including\n\nCFS and myalgias.       Id. at 12-14 & n.4.

In\n\norder to remain eligible for benefits after the first 24 months of\n\npayments, the claimant needed to show \u201cthat she was disabled from\n\nduties of \u2018any job for which [she was] reasonably fitted . . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nId. at 13. Though the plan administrator, Prudential, \u201cwas willing\n\nto accept that [the claimant] suffered from the illnesses she\n\nreported to her doctors[,]\u201d it terminated the claimant\u2019s benefits,\n\nin   pertinent    part,       because    her   file    did    not   indicate     \u201cany\n\nlimitations or restrictions, based on objective findings, that\n\nwould preclude [her] from performing any occupation for which she\n\nis suited.\u201d      Id. at 15, 16 n.5.        We affirmed the district court\u2019s\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fgrant of summary judgment to Prudential, reasoning that, \u201cwhile\n\nthe diagnoses of [CFS] and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to\n\nobjective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed by\n\nthe    symptoms       of    such    illnesses       lend   themselves    to   objective\n\nanalysis.\u201d       Id. at 16 n.5, 17.\n\n            We have since repeatedly invoked this principle and\n\nBoardman\u2019s diagnosis-disabling symptom distinction when reviewing\n\nplan    administrators\u2019            benefit    determinations.        See      Cusson   v.\n\nLiberty Life Assur. Co. of Bos., 592 F.3d 215, 227 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(observing that the plan administrator did not \u201cquestion the\n\ndiagnosis of fibromyalgia,\u201d but \u201cinstead . . . questioned the\n\neffect of the disease on [the claimant\u2019s] ability to work . . . .\n\nBecause    it     is       permissible       to    require   documented,      objective\n\nevidence of disability, it was not inappropriate for [the plan\n\nadministrator] to rely on the lack of such documented evidence, or\n\non the footage that contradicted [the claimant\u2019s] reports of\n\nlimitations, in making their recommendations\u201d that the plaintiff\n\nwas able to work and thus not disabled under the terms of the\n\nplan), abrogated on other grounds by Montanile v. Bd. of Trustees\n\nof Nat. Elevator Indus. Health Benefit Plan, 577 U.S. 136 (2016);\n\nDenmark, 481 F.3d at 37 (holding that the plan administrator acted\n\n\u201cwithin the parameters defined in Boardman\u201d when it required the\n\nclaimant,       who    was     diagnosed          with   fibromyalgia,   to    \u201cprovide\n\nobjective evidence of functional limitations or restrictions that\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\fwould prevent her from working\u201d in order to qualify for long-term\n\ndisability benefits).          Here, we endorse our holding in Boardman\n\nonce again and conclude that it was reasonable for Unum to require\n\nobjective proof of Ovist\u2019s functional loss.11\n\n              Ovist attempts to escape this outcome by emphasizing\n\nthat,      prior   to   imposing   this    evidentiary   requirement,   Unum\n\nrepeatedly found that Ovist was unable to work and did not harbor\n\nany     suspicions      that   Ovist     was    falsifying   her   functional\n\nlimitations.       This argument is misplaced, as it constitutes an\n\nobjection to the design of the Plan\u2014over which the \u201demployer ha[s]\n\nlarge leeway\u201d\u2014rather than a viable challenge to the reasonableness\n\n\n      11We do acknowledge, as the district court did, that Unum\u2019s\nclaim log and correspondence with Ovist also intermittently\nfocused on the absence of objective evidence supporting her\ndiagnoses.    For example, in February and April 2015 letters\nnotifying Ovist that her benefits would be terminated under the\nSRS limitation, Unum stated that her functional limitations were\nassociated with fibromyalgia and CFS, two conditions that \u201cwere\nconsidered self-reported\u201d since they could not be confirmed by\n\u201cclinical signs\u201d or \u201cdiagnostic test findings.\u201d Relatedly, when\nUnum sought guidance from legal counsel on Ovist\u2019s claim, its\nquestion turned on Ovist\u2019s diagnosis, as opposed to her functional\nlimitations. Specifically, Unum asked counsel if it was legally\npermissible to apply the SRS limitation to a diagnosis of\nfibromyalgia. While these examples show an inconsistency in Unum\u2019s\nhandling of Ovist\u2019s claim, they are peripheral to our analysis on\nappeal.   This court\u2019s analysis centers on Unum\u2019s final adverse\nbenefit determination. See Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 35\n(1st Cir. 1998) (stating that the court \u201cmust focus, as in the\nusual case, on the determination of the final decision-maker\u201d when\nreviewing an appeal of the plan administrator\u2019s decision to\nterminate benefits). And in this case, Unum\u2019s medical question on\nappeal, subsequent internal analysis, and denial of Unum\u2019s appeal\nall primarily centered on the insufficient objective evidence of\nOvist\u2019s functional limitations.\n\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fof Unum\u2019s benefit determination.        Black & Decker Disability Plan\n\nv. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 833 (2003).\n\n          Indeed, under the terms of the Plan, individuals are\n\nconsidered \u201cdisabled\u201d and eligible for benefits if they are unable\n\nto complete the \u201cmaterial and substantial duties\u201d of their jobs\n\ndue to their illnesses.     The SRS limitation confines the benefit\n\nperiod to 24 months for the same, disabled individuals if they\n\nhave, in pertinent part, \u201cdisabilities based primarily on self-\n\nreported symptoms.\u201d      Unum simply followed the Plan\u2019s blueprint,\n\nthen, by first determining that Ovist was unable to work (and\n\nthereby granting her benefits), and then reasonably requiring\n\nobjective proof of her functional loss in order to determine if\n\nher disabilities were \u201cbased primarily on self-reported symptoms,\u201d\n\nand thus subject to the associated benefit limitation.         It follows\n\nthat Ovist takes issue with her employer\u2019s decision to establish\n\na different evidentiary hurdle (centered on objective evidence)\n\nfor claimants seeking to obtain benefits over the long term, as\n\nopposed to claimants seeking benefits for only 24 months or less.\n\nThis objection to the Plan\u2019s design does not alter our analysis\n\nunder Boardman.\n\nB. Unum\u2019s Denial of Long-term Disability              Benefits     on   the\n   Information Before it was Reasonable\n\n          Ovist   next    argues    that    Unum   reached   its   benefit\n\ndetermination by unreasonably rejecting her CPET results, which,\n\n\n\n                                   - 32 -\n\faccording to Ovist, provide objective proof of her functional\n\nlimitations.     Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, our\n\ntask is not to re-weigh the evidence in the record.            Instead, we\n\nmust uphold the plan administrator\u2019s decision if it \u201cis reasonable\n\nand supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d\n\nMcDonough, 783 F.3d at 379 (citing Colby, 705 F.3d at 61).              This\n\nalso means, however, that \u201c[p]lan administrators . . . may not\n\narbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant\u2019s reliable evidence[.]\u201d\n\nBlack & Decker Disability Plan, 538 U.S. at 834.            Upon reviewing\n\nthe record, we find that Unum\u2019s conclusion that Ovist\u2019s functional\n\nlimitations were \u201cinconsistent with and/or not supported based on\n\nclinical exam and/or diagnostic findings, procedures, and/or other\n\nclinical findings\u201d is both supported by substantial evidence and\n\nconsistent with a reasonable review of the record as a whole,\n\nincluding the CPET results.\n\n           To begin, Unum reviewed Ovist\u2019s file on at least five\n\nseparate occasions, allowing Ovist to supplement the file with\n\nmedical providers\u2019 opinions and other evidence in the interim.\n\nUnum also followed up with Ovist\u2019s physicians in order to obtain\n\nupdates   on   her   conditions   and   the   basis   of   their   opinions.\n\nFurther, Unum alerted Ovist to the absence of objective evidence\n\nof her functional limitations; for example, in a February 2015\n\nadverse benefit determination letter, Unum stated that Ovist\u2019s\n\n\u201cphysical examinations remain unremarkable,\u201d and \u201c[t]here had been\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\fno   diagnostic     testing    performed   to    explain   the     etiology   of\n\n[Ovist\u2019s]     complaints.\u201d        Still,     Unum\u2019s     medical    consultants\n\nrepeatedly found that there were no diagnostic findings or clinical\n\nexaminations explaining Ovist\u2019s consistent reports of pain and\n\nfatigue and her associated functional loss.\n\n             Dr. Broadwell was the first consultant to make this\n\nobservation, in 2011.      In 2013, Dr. Smith concluded that Ovist was\n\nunable to work based on her consistent complaints of pain and\n\nfatigue,     her   treatment    history,   Dr.   Hoffman\u2019s   report     of    her\n\nnarcotic dependence, observations from Unum\u2019s field visit, and her\n\n2012 SSDI award.      Dr. Smith did not base his conclusion, then, on\n\nany clinical exams, diagnostic findings, or objectively verifiable\n\nphysical exams evidencing Ovist\u2019s functional limitations.                Next,\n\nin   2014,    Nurse    Curran    determined      that    Ovist\u2019s    functional\n\nlimitations \u201cwere supported based on the consistency of [her]\n\ncomplaints,\u201d but \u201cthere was no physical basis to explain the\n\netiology of [those] complaints.\u201d\n\n             Only one of Ovist\u2019s doctors, Dr. Klimas, claimed that\n\nOvist\u2019s condition and/or symptoms were \u201cconfirmed by physical\n\nexamination . . . and laboratory data\u201d showing \u201cimpaired immune\n\nfunction . . . and latent virus reactivations.\u201d                  Two of Unum\u2019s\n\nmedical consultants considered and rejected Dr. Klimas\u2019s claim.\n\nDr. Bress noted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s tests for immune function and\n\nviruses were not \u201cstandard medical testing\u201d and/or were unrelated\n\n\n                                    - 34 -\n\fto Ovist\u2019s symptoms.            Dr. Hauser also asserted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s\n\ntests for viral infection provided evidence of past, but not\n\nongoing, infections.12              Dr. Hauser         accordingly concluded that\n\nOvist\u2019s      impairing     symptoms        were   not    \u201cattributable      to   (either\n\ndirectly or indirectly) viral infection, immune deficiency, or any\n\nother       verifiable     (through      physical       examination    or   diagnostic\n\ntesting) medical condition,\u201d and Dr. Bress concurred.\n\n               Unum\u2019s reviewers also considered other diagnostic and\n\nclinical exam findings and objectively verifiable evidence in\n\nUnum\u2019s file and found that they were normal and/or could not\n\nexplain       the    severity     of    Ovist\u2019s       disabling    symptoms      and   her\n\nresulting functional limitations.                      Malan-Elzawahry found that\n\nOvist\u2019s 2012 sleep study and 2015 cardiac tests did not identify\n\nconditions      or     symptoms     that      could    explain    Ovist\u2019s   functional\n\nlimitations.         Dr. Norris determined that Ovist\u2019s laboratory tests\n\nwere        negative      for       \u201cinfections,         metabolic,      hematologic,\n\ninflammatory, or other verifiable causes\u201d of Ovist\u2019s fatigue.                           He\n\nalso noted that Ovist\u2019s cardiac tests were normal, and no tests or\n\nexaminations         in   Ovist\u2019s      file    were    consistent    with   \u201ccognitive\n\nimpairment related to physical conditions.\u201d                       Finally, Dr. Bress,\n\nMalan-Elzawahry, and Dr. Norris reviewed Ovist\u2019s fungal report and\n\n\n        Consistent with this finding, when reviewing Ovist\u2019s\n       12\n\nadministrative appeal, Unum\u2019s Malan-Elzawahry also found that\nOvist\u2019s tests for viral illnesses, dating back to 2006, did not\nprovide evidence of current infections.\n\n\n                                           - 35 -\n\fthe mold analysis of her home and agreed that there was no known\n\nassociation between mold or fungus exposure and Ovist\u2019s disabling\n\nsymptoms.\n\n            Ovist does not dispute Unum\u2019s assessment of the evidence\n\nabove.    Rather, Ovist points to her September 2015 CPET results as\n\nthe   singular    source    of    objective      proof    of    her   functional\n\nlimitations, and she argues that Unum rejected the CPET results on\n\n\u201cthe flimsiest of grounds.\u201d        We disagree.\n\n            Unum\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Norris, reviewed the CPET\n\nresults and concluded that the test was not time-relevant and did\n\nnot reflect Ovist\u2019s maximal effort.              Dr. Norris\u2019s assessment of\n\nOvist\u2019s   maximal      effort   was,    at   least   in   part,    supported   by\n\nCournoyer\u2019s own statement that Ovist \u201cdemonstrated maximal effort\n\nin some, but not all of the testing measures.\u201d                 On the other side\n\nof the ledger, Cournoyer opined that the tests on both days were\n\n\u201cof maximal nature.\u201d       His report lists respiratory, metabolic, and\n\nother markers showing that Ovist experienced fatigue and cognitive\n\nimpairment following physical activity on both days.                   And Ovist\n\nargues    that   the    seven-month      gap    between   the     February   2015\n\ntermination of her claim and the administration of the CPET is not\n\nmeaningful because there is no evidence that her symptoms changed\n\nduring that period.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\f           When considering the CPET,13 Unum credited Dr. Norris\u2019s\n\nopinion over Cournoyer\u2019s findings. We have \u201ctreated a nonexamining\n\nphysician\u2019s    review   of   a   claimant\u2019s    file   as    reliable    medical\n\nevidence on several occasions,\u201d Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n360 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing cases), and we find no\n\nbasis on the record to conclude that Dr. Norris\u2019s opinion is\n\nunreliable.    Thus, Dr. Norris\u2019s critique of the CPET provides a\n\nreasonable basis for Unum to find that the CPET results alone did\n\nnot compensate for the considerable absence in the record of\n\nobjective evidence of Ovist\u2019s functional loss, and therefore to\n\nconclude that Ovist\u2019s \u201cfunctional limitation was based primarily\n\non self-reported pain and fatigue.\u201d           This conclusion holds, even\n\nthough the CPET arguably provides some objective proof of Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional loss.     See Boardman, 337 F.3d at 15 (\u201cThe existence of\n\ncontrary   evidence     does     not   necessarily     render    [the     claim\n\nadministrator\u2019s]        decision       arbitrary      and     capricious.\u201d).\n\nAccordingly,    we   conclude      that,   notwithstanding      Ovist\u2019s    CPET\n\nresults, Unum\u2019s decision to apply the SRS limitation to Ovist\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n     13 We use the term \u2018considering\u2019 instead of \u2018rejecting\u2019\nbecause it is not clear, based on Unum\u2019s final adverse benefit\ndetermination letter, that Unum discredited the CPET results\nentirely.   Rather, Unum noted that the results were not time-\nrelevant, and that Ovist did not exhibit full effort on all of the\ntests. Then, Unum concluded that, \u201c[r]egardless of [Cournoyer\u2019s]\nfindings[,]\u201d Ovist\u2019s \u201cfunctional limitation is based primarily[,]\u201d\nthough not necessarily wholly, \u201con self-reported pain and\nfatigue.\u201d\n\n\n                                    - 37 -\n\fclaim was reasonable and rests on substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord as a whole.14\n\nC. The Seventh Circuit Weitzenkamp Test is in Conflict With First\n   Circuit Law\n\n            Having found that Unum\u2019s decision to terminate Ovist\u2019s\n\nbenefits was reasonable under this circuit\u2019s precedent, we are\n\nunconvinced by Ovist\u2019s argument that Unum\u2019s application of the SRS\n\nlimitation    is   improper   because   this   court   should   adopt   the\n\nstandards under Weitzenkamp, a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals\n\ndecision.    In Weitzenkamp, the court interpreted an SRS limitation\n\nalmost identical to the one at bar.        Under the SRS limitation in\n\nWeitzenkamp, benefits ceased after 24 months for individuals with\n\n\u201cdisabilities, due to sickness or injury, which are primarily based\n\non self-reported symptoms, and disabilities due to mental illness,\n\nalcoholism or drug abuse.\u201d       661 F.3d at 326-27.       Self-reported\n\nsymptoms are also defined identically in the plan in Weitzenkamp\n\nand the Plan in this case.      Id. at 327.\n\n\n\n\n     14 Ovist also argues that Unum unreasonably applied the SRS\nlimitation to her claim based on her mental illness. Since the\nSRS limitation, by its terms, applies to \u201cany combination\u201d of\n\u201cdisabilities due to mental illness and disabilities based\nprimarily on self-reported symptoms,\u201d Unum can reasonably apply\nthe limitation when only one of the categories of disabilities is\npresent. Since we already determined that Unum reasonably applied\nthe limitation after completing more than 24 months of payments\nfor the second category of \u201cdisabilities based primarily on self-\nreported symptoms,\u201d we need not consider whether it was also\nreasonable to apply the limitation under the first category of\ndisabilities \u201cdue to mental illness.\u201d\n\n\n                                 - 38 -\n\f           The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the\n\nSRS limitation \u201capplies to disabling illnesses or injuries that\n\nare diagnosed primarily based on self-reported symptoms rather\n\nthan to all illnesses or injuries for which disabling symptoms are\n\nself-reported.\u201d     Id. at 330 (emphasis in original).           The court\n\nnoted that, if the SRS limitation applied to the latter category\n\nof conditions, it would limit benefits for individuals with most\n\nany disease with symptoms such as pain, weakness, and fatigue\u2014\n\nsymptoms which \u201care difficult if not impossible to verify using\n\nobjective medical evidence.\u201d     Id.     The court then determined that\n\nthe   plaintiff\u2019s   diagnosis   of     fibromyalgia   was     supported   by\n\nobjective evidence in the form of a positive tender point exam,\n\nand thus the SRS limitation did not apply.            Id. at 331.     Ovist\n\nposits that the same outcome should follow here, as she was\n\npositive for at least 11 of 18 tender points when examined, and\n\nthis circuit has determined that the tender or trigger points\n\nprovide   \u201cthe   clinical   findings    necessary   for   a   diagnosis   of\n\nfibromyalgia under established medical guidelines[.]\u201d            Johnson v.\n\nAstrue, 597 F.3d 409, 412 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Respectfully, we decline to follow the reasoning and\n\nholding in Weitzenkamp, as they are in tension with this circuit\u2019s\n\nlong-held diagnosis-disabling symptom distinction as articulated\n\nin Boardman, and the underlying principle that \u201cthe physical\n\nlimitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses [as CFS and\n\n\n                                 - 39 -\n\ffibromyalgia],\u201d including pain and fatigue, do \u201clend themselves to\n\nobjective analysis.\u201d   Boardman, 337 F.3d at 16 n.4.   Accordingly,\n\neven if we accept that Ovist tested positive for fibromyalgia based\n\non tender points, we still conclude that it was reasonable for\n\nUnum to require that Ovist provide objective evidence of her\n\nfunctional limitations, and to apply the SRS limitation based on\n\nthe relative absence of this evidence.\n\n          We also find Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement to be\n\nreasonable (contrary to the conclusion in Weitzenkamp) for at least\n\ntwo reasons.   First, it merely calls for the claimant to establish\n\na causal connection between his or her disability and his or her\n\nalleged functional limitation(s) before being awarded long-term\n\ndisability benefits beyond 24 months.    Far from being arbitrary or\n\ncapricious, this type of inquiry into causation is often necessary\n\nfor a claim administrator to ensure that benefits are paid as\n\nintended by the operative policy.   See, e.g., Arruda, 951 F.3d at\n\n21-22 (finding that the claimant was not eligible for death\n\nbenefits under an insurance policy issued for accidental death or\n\ninjury, since substantial evidence in the record supported the\n\nconclusion that the death was caused or contributed to by the\n\ndecedent\u2019s pre-existing health conditions).      In this case, the\n\ncausal connection must be established to confirm that Ovist is\n\nunable to work due to her recognized, diagnosed medical conditions,\n\nas opposed to her unverifiable perceptions.\n\n\n                               - 40 -\n\f             Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement is also reasonable\n\nbecause it furthers the purpose of the SRS limitation, as defined\n\nby   Unum.         Under   the    terms    of    the   Plan,     Unum   \u201cha[s]   the\n\ndiscretionary authority to construe the [P]lan\u201d; thus, Unum also\n\n\u201cha[s] the discretion to determine the intended meaning of the\n\n[P]lan\u2019s terms.\u201d           Stamp, 531 F.3d at 93-94 (internal quotation\n\nomitted). And according to Unum, the purpose of the SRS limitation\n\nis \u201cto address conditions\u201d that manifest themselves in a manner\n\nthat renders the           resulting functional limitations \u201cinherently\n\ndifficult to determine.\u201d             It should not be deemed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, then, for Unum to further this goal by requiring\n\nobjective evidence of Ovist\u2019s functional limitations, as such\n\nevidence is a more reliable indicator of the severity of Ovist\u2019s\n\nlimitations than her self-reporting of pain and fatigue.                     Unum\u2019s\n\nrequirement is particularly reasonable here, where Ovist had the\n\nopportunity to take the CPET, a test that can provide objective\n\nevidence of her functional limitations, but she failed to do so in\n\na timely manner.           Ultimately, we do not adopt Weitzenkamp, and\n\ninstead adhere to this circuit\u2019s law and conclude that Unum\u2019s\n\ninterpretation        of    the   SRS     limitation      is   not   arbitrary    or\n\ncapricious.\n\nIV.

This     case   involves      a\n\ndispute over the applicability of a self-reported symptoms benefit\n\nlimitation provision to a long-term disability claim.              Plaintiff-\n\nappellant Rhonda Ovist is a participant in her employer\u2019s long-\n\nterm   disability     plan   (\u201cthe    Plan\u201d),     which    is    insured    and\n\nadministered by defendant-appellee Unum Life Insurance Company of\n\nAmerica and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 et. seq.                 Ovist, who suffers\n\nfrom   Chronic   Fatigue     Syndrome        (\u201cCFS\u201d),     fibromyalgia,      and\n\nassociated   symptoms    including     pain    and   fatigue,    was   granted\n\nbenefits under the Plan in 2011.         The Plan provides for a maximum\n\nbenefit period of 24 months for \u201cdisabilities due to mental illness\n\nand disabilities based primarily on self-reported symptoms.\u201d                Unum\n\nterminated   Ovist\u2019s    benefits     under    this   provision     (\u201cthe     SRS\n\nlimitation\u201d) in February 2015, after paying benefits to Ovist for\n\nabout 43 months.\n\n           Following an unsuccessful administrative appeal, Ovist\n\nfiled an ERISA action in the U.S. District Court for the District\n\nof   Massachusetts,    seeking   recovery      and   reinstatement     of   her\n\nbenefits as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.             The parties filed\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted\n\nUnum\u2019s motion but denied Ovist\u2019s cross-motion.            Ovist v. Unum Life\n\nIns. Co. of Am., No. 4:17-cv-40113-TSH, 2020 WL 1931755 (D. Mass.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 3 -\n\fFeb. 21, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No. 4:17-cv-\n\n40113, 2020 WL 1931958 (D. Mass. Mar. 27, 2020).\n\n                  Ovist    challenges     Unum\u2019s      decision     to   terminate    her\n\nbenefits; in particular, Ovist objects to Unum\u2019s requirement that\n\nshe provide objective evidence of her functional limitations1 in\n\norder to avoid the SRS limitation.                          This requirement, Ovist\n\ncontends, runs counter to the parameters of the SRS limitation, as\n\ninterpreted by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Weitzenkamp\n\nv. Unum Life Insurance Company of America, 661 F.3d 323 (7th Cir.\n\n2011). In Weitzenkamp, the court concluded that a nearly identical\n\nSRS limitation is applicable to \u201cdisabling illnesses or injuries\n\nthat       are    diagnosed      primarily    based    on    self-reported       symptoms\n\nrather than to all illnesses or injuries for which the disabling\n\nsymptoms are self-reported.\u201d                 Id. at 330 (emphasis in original).\n\nOvist further argues that the SRS limitation does not apply to her\n\nclaim under Unum\u2019s interpretation of the provision, since she\n\nprovided objective evidence of her functional limitations, which\n\nUnum unreasonably rejected.\n\n                  We   decline    Ovist\u2019s    invitation       to   adopt   the   Seventh\n\nCircuit          Court    of   Appeals\u2019   holding     in    Weitzenkamp,    concluding\n\n\n       A \u201cfunctional limitation\u201d is a \u201crestriction or lack of\n       1\n\nability in performing an action as a result of a disability.\u201d\nAmerican Psychological Association, APA Dictionary of Psychology,\nat https://dictionary.apa.org/functional-limitation. We use the\nterms    \u201cfunctional   loss\u201d    and   \u201cfunctional    limitations\u201d\ninterchangeably.\n\n\n                                            - 4 -\n\finstead that Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement is permissible\n\nunder this circuit\u2019s precedent and is consistent with a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the SRS limitation provision.          Further, we find\n\nthat Unum\u2019s determination that Ovist lacked objective proof of her\n\nfunctional   limitations   rests    on     substantial   evidence   in   the\n\nrecord, and is thus not arbitrary or capricious.           We accordingly\n\naffirm the entry of summary judgment to Unum.2\n\nI. Facts\n\n           Ovist began working as a sociology professor at Rollins\n\nCollege in 1999.   Her responsibilities included teaching, advising\n\nstudents, developing courses, grading papers, and researching and\n\nwriting.   In its claim log, Unum noted that Ovist began reporting\n\nand seeking treatment for \u201csevere fatigue and generalized diffuse\n\npain in 2003,\u201d and she was treated with narcotics and \u201cseveral\n\ncourses of antiviral agents.\u201d         Ovist\u2019s complaints of pain and\n\nfatigue continued over the years. Rollins College approved Ovist\u2019s\n\nrequest for short-term disability leave from January 9, 2011 to\n\nJune 1, 2011, based on diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome\n\n(\u201cCFS\u201d), cytomegaloviral illness, sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis,\n\n\n\n\n     2 The Secretary of Labor filed a brief in this case as amicus\ncuriae. In the brief, the Secretary supports placing the burden\non the plan, and not the plan participant, to prove the\napplicability of a benefit limitation, such as the SRS limitation.\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the Secretary\u2019s assistance in this\ncase.\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fand   parvovirus.     In   June     2011,    Ovist   applied   for   long-term\n\ndisability benefits under the Plan.\n\nA. Relevant Terms of the Plan\n\n            The Plan \u201cdelegates to Unum . . . discretionary authority\n\nto make benefit determinations under the Plan[,] . . . includ[ing]\n\ndetermining    eligibility    for    benefits    and   the     amount   of   any\n\nbenefits,     resolving    factual    disputes,      and   interpreting      and\n\nenforcing the provisions of the Plan.\u201d An individual is considered\n\n\u201cdisabled\u201d and eligible for benefits under the Plan when she is\n\n\u201climited from performing the material and substantial duties of\n\n[her] regular occupation due to [her] sickness or injury; and [has]\n\na 20% or more loss in [her] indexed monthly earnings due to the\n\nsame sickness or injury.\u201d\n\n            This    case   centers     on     Unum\u2019s    interpretation       and\n\napplication of the SRS limitation, a provision of the Plan that\n\nlimits the benefit period to 24 months for certain disabilities.\n\nThe SRS limitation provides:\n\n            The lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period\n            for all disabilities due to mental illness and\n            disabilities based primarily on self-reported\n            symptoms is 24 months.     Only 24 months of\n            benefits will be paid for any combination of\n            such disabilities even if the disabilities:\n            are not continuous; and/or are not related.\n\n        The Plan defines mental illness as:\n\n            A psychiatric or psychological condition\n            classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical\n            Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM},\n\n\n                                     - 6 -\n\f           published   by   the   American   Psychiatric\n           Association, most current as of the start of\n           a disability. Such disorders include, but are\n           not limited to, psychotic, emotional or\n           behavioral disorders, or disorders relatable\n           to stress.\n\n         And the Plan defines self-reported symptoms as:\n\n           The manifestations of your condition which you\n           tell your physician, that are not verifiable\n           using    tests,   procedures    or    clinical\n           examinations standardly accepted in the\n           practice of medicine. Examples of self-\n           reported symptoms include, but are not limited\n           to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness,\n           soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness\n           and loss of energy.\n\nB. First Review of Disability Claim\n\n           Ovist submitted her long-term disability claim form in\n\nJune 2011, listing CFS as the illness causing her disability.      In\n\nan accompanying Attending Physician Statement, Ovist\u2019s primary\n\ncare physician, Dr. John Hudson, confirmed that CFS is the \u201cprimary\n\ndiagnosis preventing the patient from working[.]\u201d     He also listed\n\nsecondary diagnoses of Parvovirus3 and fibromyalgia,4 along with\n\n\n     3  According to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cmost people with parvovirus\ninfection have no signs or symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they\nvary greatly depending on how old you are when you get the disease.\u201d\nFor adults, \u201c[t]he most noticeable symptom of parvovirus infection .\n. . is joint soreness lasting days to weeks.\u201d Mayo Clinic, Parvovirus\ninfection, at https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-\nconditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085.\n     4  According to the National Institute of Health, fibromyalgia\nis \u201ca long-lasting or chronic disorder that causes muscle pain and\nfatigue,\u201d and \u201c[t]he symptoms of fibromyalgia are pain and\ntenderness throughout your body.\u201d National Institute of Health,\nFibromyalgia, at https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/fibromyalgia.\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\fthe following symptoms: severe chronic fatigue, severe muscle and\n\njoint pain, dizziness, insomnia, depression, and \u201cunclear mental\n\nclarity, or brain fog[.]\u201d\n\n            The   following   month,     on    July   15,   2011,   Dr.   Hudson\n\ncompleted a detailed assessment of Ovist, in which he repeated\n\nmany of the same diagnoses and symptoms, along with acute and\n\nchronic sinusitis,     opioid withdrawal,          chronic bronchitis,       and\n\nvarious viral infections.        Dr. Hudson indicated that he referred\n\nOvist to Dr. Nancy Klimas, a chronic fatigue specialist, for a\n\nsecond opinion on CFS and fibromyalgia.\n\n            In an Initial Progress Note dated July 29, 2011, Dr.\n\nKlimas wrote that Ovist is \u201cvery disabled . . . with [symptoms]\n\nconsistent with CFS.\u201d         Dr. Klimas prescribed a sleep study to\n\ndetermine the presence of apnea and ordered lab tests for \u201cimmune\n\nactivation, function, [and] cytokines.\u201d\n\n            In August 2011, Unum sent letters to three of Ovist\u2019s\n\nphysicians\u2014Dr. Kent Hoffman, who treated Ovist for pain and opioid\n\ndependence; Dr. Klimas; and Dr. Cory Baill, a gynecologist who\n\nbegan    treating   Ovist   as   early    as    2002\u2014to     ask   whether   they\n\nrestricted Ovist from completing her work, which, according to\n\nUnum\u2019s    Vocational   Rehabilitation          Consultant,    involved      light\n\nphysical demands.      Specifically, Unum asked the doctors if they\n\n\u201crestrict Ms. Ovist from performing full time work [that includes]\n\nsitting up to frequently and standing/walking up to frequently;\n\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fexerting 20 [pounds] of force occasionally or ten [pounds] of force\n\nfrequently, and/or a negligible amount of force constantly to lift,\n\ncarry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects, including the human\n\nbody[.]\u201d     Each doctor confirmed that Ovist could not work under\n\nthe physical demands listed.\n\n            On September 1, 2011, Dr. Freeman Broadwell, a medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and found that she\n\nconsistently reported pain and fatigue and received treatment for\n\nthese symptoms from multiple providers over several years.                      Dr.\n\nBroadwell did not find, however, that the \u201cexistence, intensity,\n\nfrequency,       and    duration   of    chronic   pain    and   fatigue   [were]\n\nconsistent with the clinical examination / diagnostic findings.\u201d\n\nNor did he find from Ovist\u2019s work-up that chronic infection or any\n\nother physical condition could explain a level of impairment that\n\nrendered Ovist unable to work. Dr. Broadwell nonetheless concluded\n\nthat \u201c[d]ue to the consistency of [Ovist\u2019s] reports\u201d of chronic\n\npain and fatigue \u201ccorroborated by her providers and absence of\n\nevidence to the contrary, the [restrictions and limitations] of no\n\nwork are supported.\u201d\n\n            In a letter dated September 13, 2011, Unum approved\n\nOvist\u2019s    claim       for   long-term   disability      benefits   \u201cdue   to   the\n\nsymptoms related to [her] medical condition of [CFS].\u201d                Unum noted\n\nthat her file shows that she had \u201cconsistently reported and been\n\ntreated    for    self-reported      complaints     of    chronic   fatigue     and\n\n\n                                         - 9 -\n\fchronic diffuse pain,\u201d and added that the Plan \u201climit[s] [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nbenefits to 24 months due to [her] medical condition of [CFS].\u201d\n\nConsequently, Unum provided an end date of June 29, 2013 for\n\nOvist\u2019s benefit payments.\n\nC. Second Review of Disability Claim\n\n           During 2012 and 2013, Ovist\u2019s physicians and Unum\u2019s\n\nPersonal Visit Consultant documented the persistence of Ovist\u2019s\n\nconditions and symptoms. In a status update dated January 6, 2012,\n\nDr. Klimas observed that Ovist continued to have physical and\n\ncognitive impairments, and that her pain was a \u201cvery serious issue\n\n. . . requiring increasing levels of pain med[ications].\u201d                   She\n\nprovided   a   primary   diagnosis   of    immune    deficiency     based   on\n\n\u201claboratory testing demonstrat[ing] poor cellular function . . . ,\n\nproinflammatory cytokine expression, [and] serology consistent\n\nwith   viral   reactivation.\u201d    Dr.      Klimas    also   listed   secondary\n\ndiagnoses of fatigue and fibromyalgia.        On May 4, 2012, Dr. Klimas\n\nreported no improvement in Ovist\u2019s functional capacity and advised\n\nthat Ovist have \u201cunrestricted access to rest\u201d and \u201cavoid exposure\n\nto community acquired infections.\u201d\n\n           On May 14, 2012, Unum\u2019s Personal Visit Consultant, Mark\n\nCox, conducted a field visit with Ovist.           Cox noted in his report\n\nthat Ovist remained seated throughout the visit, and he \u201cdid not\n\nobserve the insured display any physical signs of pain / discomfort\n\nwhile she was seated . . . .\u201d          But Cox also found that Ovist\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f\u201cappeared tired and fatigued throughout the entire field visit,\u201d\n\n\u201cappeared to have some difficulty staying focused on the topics\n\nbeing discussed,\u201d and occasionally slurred her speech.            A couple\n\nmonths later, in response to a request for information from Unum,\n\nDr.   Hoffman   opined   that   Ovist\u2019s    diagnoses   were   chronic   pain\n\nsyndrome, fibromyalgia, and opioid dependence.         He maintained that\n\nOvist was unable to work.\n\n           Ovist\u2019s behavioral health issues also begin to appear in\n\nthe record during this time period.           Around August 2012, Ovist\n\nbegan seeing a clinical psychologist, Dr. Catherine Segota.             That\n\nsame month, Ovist submitted a form to the Florida Department of\n\nHealth, in which she reported experiencing daily panic and/or\n\nanxiety attacks that lasted from 15 minutes to hours.          Roughly one\n\nmonth later, on September 14, 2012, Ovist was awarded social\n\nsecurity disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) benefits retroactive to\n\nApril 2012.     The Social Security Administration determined that\n\nOvist was disabled as of October 26, 2011, with diagnoses of \u201cother\n\nunspecified arthropathy\u201d5 and \u201canxiety related disorder.\u201d\n\n           On July 19, 2013, Dr. Tony Smith, a medical consultant\n\nfor Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and wrote that multiple specialists\n\n\n      According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, arthropathy is \u201ca\n      5\n\njoint disease, of which arthritis is a type,\u201d and its symptoms\ninclude \u201cjoint swelling, stiffness[,] [and] reduced range of\nmotion.\u201d Johns Hopkins Medicine, Arthropathy, at\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-\ndiseases/arthropathy.\n\n\n                                  - 11 -\n\fdiagnosed Ovist with CFS, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain syndrome,\n\nthough \u201c[n]o specific etiology for the opined diagnoses has been\n\nestablished to date.\u201d   Dr. Smith determined that \u201cthe medical data\n\ndocumenting   Ovist\u2019s   consistent    complaints,\u201d      Ovist\u2019s   level   of\n\ntreatment, Dr. Hoffman\u2019s report of narcotic dependence, Cox\u2019s\n\ndescription of Ovist\u2019s lack of focus and slurred speech, and the\n\n2012 SSDI award \u201creasonably support[] a finding that Ms. Ovist may\n\nhave difficulty working in a sedentary or light capacity on a\n\nconsistent    basis.\u201d    He   added   that    Ovist\u2019s    \u201cimprovement     is\n\nreasonable and expected,\u201d and he suggested a follow-up with Ovist\n\nin 8-12 months.\n\n          Unum\u2019s claim log indicates that, on July 22, 2013, Unum\n\nnotified Ovist over the phone that her claim would undergo further\n\nreview and her benefits would continue, though the initial 24-\n\nmonth benefit period had passed in June.         Unum also conveyed to\n\nOvist that it still found that she was unable to work, but\n\nimprovement was reasonable and expected.        The following day, Unum\n\nnoted in the claim log that Ovist\u2019s file was transferred to the\n\nSpecial Benefits Unit CORE section, and the next steps were an\n\nannual telephone call with Ovist and a medical update in 12 months.\n\nOne year later, in June 2014, Ovist\u2019s file was \u201creassign[ed]\u201d from\n\nthe CORE to the \u201cComp.\u201d section, \u201cto hold\u201d the annual telephone\n\ncall with Ovist, \u201crequest records,\u201d review her eligibility, and\n\n\u201cdiscuss[] [] the SR[S] limitation.\u201d         Ovist asserts, based on an\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\faffidavit from an employee of Unum, that the CORE section manages\n\nclaims pertaining to conditions that are unlikely to improve, and\n\nthe \u201cComp.\u201d section \u201cmanages claims with great scrutiny.\u201d\n\nD. Third Review of Disability Claim\n\n             In August and September 2014, Unum reached out to Ovist\u2019s\n\ntreatment providers, Dr. Deborah Dube, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Segota,\n\nand Dr. Klimas, requesting updates on Ovist\u2019s conditions and\n\nfunctional limitations.      Dr. Dube, Dr. Hoffman, and Dr. Segota\n\nresponded to Unum in November 2014.        Dr. Klimas\u2019s response reached\n\nUnum after it completed its third review of Ovist\u2019s claim, and\n\nUnum considered it in its next review, as discussed further below.\n\n             Dr. Dube, who treated Ovist for fatigue, generalized\n\npain, and chronic sinus infections, stated that she was unable to\n\nprovide information on Ovist\u2019s functional capacity because her\n\noffice did not perform functional capacity testing.             Dr. Hoffman\n\nmaintained that Ovist\u2019s primary diagnoses were fibromyalgia and\n\nchronic pain syndrome, and her secondary diagnosis was opioid\n\ndependence.     He explained that Ovist was still unable to work\n\nbecause her \u201cmental and physical capacities are very time limited\n\nand easily exhausted.\u201d      Finally, Dr. Segota noted that she met\n\nwith Ovist on fifteen occasions in the previous two years, and\n\nthat   she    diagnosed   Ovist   with     major   depressive     disorder,\n\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress\n\ndisorder, and \u201cunspecified neurocognitive\u201d issues.              Dr. Segota\n\n\n                                  - 13 -\n\flisted sadness, rumination, hopelessness, sleep disturbance, and\n\nfatigue    as   \u201cdata   which    support[ed]\u201d    the   diagnoses,    and   she\n\nconcluded that Ovist was unable to work for an unknown period of\n\ntime due to the severity and chronic nature of her symptoms.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, on December 14, 2014, Unum consulted\n\nwith its legal counsel regarding any \u201cconcerns with possibly\n\napplying [the SRS Limitation] to dx [a diagnosis] which may include\n\n. . . fibromyalgia[.]\u201d         Counsel advised Unum that \u201c[t]here is no\n\nbinding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit that would preclude\n\napplication of the [SRS] limitation when fibromyalgia has been\n\ndiagnosed.\u201d\n\n            On December 30, 2014, Nurse Sarah Curran, a medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and agreed with Unum\u2019s\n\nreviewers who determined in \u201c2011 and again in 2013 . . . that\n\nthere was no physical basis to explain the etiology of [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nreported   complaints     of    extreme   fatigue   and   pain[,]    and   [her\n\nrestrictions     and    limitations]      were   supported   based    on   the\n\nconsistency of [her] complaints.\u201d            Nurse Curran also noted that\n\nOvist\u2019s physical exams \u201cremain unremarkable and there has been no\n\ndiagnostic testing performed to explain the etiology of [Ovist\u2019s]\n\ncomplaints.\u201d     Nurse Curran concluded that Ovist was unable to work\n\ndue to her pain and fatigue.       She added that, based on Dr. Segota\u2019s\n\nreport, Ovist was also functionally impaired \u201cfrom a [behavioral\n\nhealth] perspective\u201d beginning in July 2012.\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\f            A   couple   weeks      later,    Dr.    Bryan   Hauser,    a   medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and consulted Dr.\n\nHoffman.    Based on that review, he agreed that Ovist was unable to\n\nwork due to the same \u201cnon-verifiable medical conditions.\u201d\n\n            In a letter dated February 17, 2015, Unum notified Ovist\n\nthat,   after     reviewing    updated       information     in   her   file,   its\n\ndetermination from 2011 remained in place\u2014Ovist was unable to work\n\ndue to CFS and fibromyalgia, and the SRS limitation applied to her\n\nclaim. Unum explained that Ovist\u2019s diagnoses \u201care considered self-\n\nreported,\u201d as they \u201ccannot be verified or confirmed by physical\n\nexamination findings that are not dependent on [Ovist\u2019s] report\n\nand cannot be verified by diagnostic test findings.\u201d                    Unum also\n\nrepeated its prior finding that Ovist\u2019s \u201cphysical examinations\n\nremain unremarkable,\u201d and \u201c[t]here had been no diagnostic testing\n\nperformed    to   explain     the    etiology       of   [Ovist\u2019s]   complaints.\u201d\n\nFinally, Unum noted that Ovist was functionally impaired from a\n\nbehavioral health perspective since July 2012, but since Ovist\u2019s\n\nmaximum benefit period had already been exhausted in June 2013 due\n\nto her conditions of CFS and fibromyalgia, Unum could \u201cno longer\n\nconsider conditions or symptoms based on either behavioral health\n\nor self-reported symptoms.\u201d            Ovist\u2019s final benefit payment was\n\nscheduled for the following day, February 18, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fE. Fourth Review of Disability Claim\n\n              Dr. Klimas responded to Ovist\u2019s 2014 request for updates\n\nin a letter dated February 24, 2015; this letter initiated a fourth\n\nround of review of Ovist\u2019s claim.                 In her letter, Dr. Klimas\n\nasserted that Ovist was unable to work, and her symptoms included\n\nfatigue,      pain,    cognitive     dysfunction,    sleep    disturbance,    and\n\nheadaches.      Dr. Klimas listed diagnoses of CFS, Immune Deficiency\n\nSyndrome, Myalgia, Orthostatic hypotension, and sleep disturbance,\n\nand she noted that water and mold damage in Ovist\u2019s home \u201cprobably\n\ncontributed to the worsening of her health.\u201d                 She added that her\n\nfindings were \u201cconfirmed by physical examination, medical history,\n\nand       laboratory    data     .    .   .     show[ing]     impaired   immune\n\nfunction . . . and latent virus reactivations.\u201d\n\n              According to the claim log, Unum tried to contact Dr.\n\nKlimas multiple times in March 2015 \u201cto clarify the etiologies of\n\n[Ovist\u2019s] impairing symptoms and the basis for the diagnosis of\n\n[the] conditions\u201d Klimas listed.                Dr. Klimas\u2019s response, dated\n\nJune 12, 2015, was considered by Unum\u2019s Appeals Committee.6\n\n              On April 14, 2015, Dr. Hauser reviewed Ovist\u2019s file\n\nagain.      He disagreed with Dr. Klimas\u2019s \u201cassertion that [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nimpairing      symptoms    are     attributable     to   (either   directly   or\n\n\n      6Unum added Dr. Klimas\u2019s June 2015 statement to Ovist\u2019s claim\nfile on July 17, 2015. The content and opinions that Dr. Klimas\u2019s\nexpressed in her June 2015 statement were similar to those\nexpressed in her February 2015 letter to Unum.\n\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\findirectly)   viral   infection,    immune    deficiency,    or    any   other\n\nverifiable (through physical examination or diagnostic testing)\n\nmedical condition.\u201d      He also noted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s tests for\n\nviral infection only provided \u201cevidence of past (and not acute or\n\nongoing)\u201d infection.       Overall, Dr. Hauser         came to a similar\n\nconclusion regarding Ovist\u2019s claim as he did the previous year\u2014\n\nthat Ovist was unable to work due to fatigue, pain, and depression,\n\nand   these   symptoms    were    attributed      to   diagnoses    of   CFS,\n\nfibromyalgia, and depression, which were not objectively verified.\n\nWith respect to fibromyalgia, Dr. Hauser stated that Ovist\u2019s\n\ndiagnosis     \u201cis     supported     by      the    history    of     chronic\n\ngeneralized . . . pain and the finding of at least 11 [of] 18\n\nfibromyalgia tender points.\u201d         He elaborated on the subjective\n\nnature of the tender point examination, noting that, during the\n\nexamination, \u201cpain elicited by the application of pressure by the\n\nexaminer (i.e., tenderness) is experienced and reported by the\n\nexaminee; its existence cannot be verified.\u201d\n\n            A couple days later, Unum medical consultant Dr. James\n\nBress completed an independent analysis of Ovist\u2019s file. Dr. Bress\n\nagreed that Ovist was unable to work, and he identified that Dr.\n\nKlimas was the only treatment provider to state that Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional loss was \u201c[due to] verifiable medical problems,\u201d namely\n\nimmune impairment and latent virus reactivations. Like Dr. Hauser,\n\nDr. Bress disagreed with this aspect of Dr. Klimas\u2019s opinion.               He\n\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fdetermined that Dr. Klimas\u2019s finding was not supported by any\n\nevidence, and that the tests Dr. Klimas administered to assess\n\nimmune function and viruses were not \u201cstandard medical testing\u201d\n\nand/or had no confirmed association with Ovist\u2019s symptoms.\n\n              Unum sent Ovist a letter dated April 17, 2015, stating\n\nthat it maintained its decision to terminate her benefits under\n\nthe SRS limitation as of February 18, 2015.           Unum explained that\n\nOvist   was    functionally   impaired   based   on   the   non-verifiable\n\nconditions of CFS, fibromyalgia, and depression.            Unum added that\n\nthe diagnoses were \u201csupported in part\u201d by Ovist\u2019s repeated reports\n\nof pain and fatigue, as well as \u201cthe finding of at least 11/18\n\nfibromyalgia tender points.\u201d\n\n              On June 15, 2015, Ovist sent Unum a fungal report and a\n\nNovember 2013 mold analysis of her home.         Dr. Hauser and Dr. Bress\n\neach reviewed the documentation and concluded that it did not\n\nchange their prior conclusions, as there is no proven association\n\nbetween mold contamination or elevated fungal spores and Ovist\u2019s\n\nsymptoms or diagnoses.         Accordingly, on July 14, 2015, Unum\n\ninformed Ovist that its benefits determination and supporting\n\nrationale remained the same.\n\nF. Ovist\u2019s Administrative Appeal\n\n              Ovist appealed Unum\u2019s decision in a letter dated July 4,\n\n2015.   Unum defined the \u201cmedical question\u201d on appeal as whether\n\n\u201cthe records support functional loss and/or [restrictions and\n\n\n                                 - 18 -\n\flimitations] due to physical medical condition/symptoms that are\n\nverifiable using tests, procedures or clinical examinations as of\n\n[February 17, 2015]         forward[.]\u201d\n\n            Ovist submitted additional information for review on\n\nappeal\u2014office notes from a gastrointestinal specialist from May\n\n2013; office notes from Dr. Hoffman from January to July 2015;\n\nrecords and diagnostic test results from primary care physician\n\nDr. Dube and cardiologist Dr. Potts from January and February 2015;\n\nand records and lab reports from Dr. Klimas from February and March\n\n2015.       Ovist    also     provided       Unum    with     the    results       of   a\n\nCardiopulmonary       Exercise      Test    (\u201cCPET\u201d)       conducted    by   exercise\n\nphysiologist Jeffrey Cournoyer on September 24-25, 2015.                      The CPET\n\nis designed \u201cto determine functional capacity and assess the\n\nrecovery response to a standardized physical stressor.\u201d7\n\n            In    his     report,    Cournoyer       explained      that     the    CPET\n\nconsisted    of     two   identical    tests        that    were    administered        on\n\nconsecutive days, in order to \u201cestablish changes in work function\n\ncapacity.\u201d        Cournoyer    noted       that   Ovist     \u201cdemonstrated      maximal\n\n\n\n\n     7 According to Massachusetts General Hospital, \u201c[t]he primary\npurpose of . . .

He\n\nalso found that Ovist\u2019s metabolic responses indicated \u201ca higher\n\nprobability of running out of energy\u201d on the second day; her\n\n\u201c[b]reathing values showed more strain\u201d on the second day; and her\n\n\u201cwattage at maximal effort\u201d on both days was \u201cpathologically low.\u201d\n\nSeemingly consistent with this, Cournoyer observed that Ovist left\n\nthe office fatigued on the first day of testing, but after the\n\nsecond day of testing, Ovist\u2019s \u201cposture and walking gait suggested\n\na severely weakened state, and [Cournoyer] was not comfortable\n\nwith allowing her to leave in that condition.\u201d        The CPET also\n\nincluded an element of cognitive testing.     Cournoyer found that\n\nOvist \u201cshowed the most drastic changes\u201d across the two days in her\n\n\u201cimmediate and delayed recall of simple information\u201d and in her\n\nconcentration.\n\n          Unum\u2019s Angela Malan-Elzawahry reviewed Ovist\u2019s file on\n\nJanuary 5, 2016.   Malan-Elzawahry detailed the medical conditions\n\nwith which Ovist had been diagnosed or for which she had been\n\nevaluated and/or treated, including infections, sinusitis, CFS,\n\nfibromyalgia, wrist pain, ankle sprain, shingles, thyroid goiter,\n\nchronic   pain     syndrome,   opioid   dependence,     depression,\n\n\n                               - 20 -\n\fcardiopulmonary     conditions,      left   knee    pain        and    related     joint\n\nissues, and mold exposure.              She also described the results of\n\nvarious laboratory or diagnostic tests administered to Ovist,\n\nwhich she found to be unremarkable.           According to Malan-Elzawahry,\n\ntests for viral illnesses, which were repeatedly administered to\n\nOvist beginning in 2006, had not provided evidence of current\n\ninfection; a 2012 sleep study did not \u201cidentify sleep apnea at a\n\nseverity to be expected to cause the level of fatigue that [Ovist]\n\nhas   reported\u201d;    and   a   2015      cardiac    evaluation          did   not   show\n\n\u201crestrictions and limitations . . . related to a cardiopulmonary\n\ncondition[.]\u201d\n\n             Malan-Elzawahry      concluded        that     Ovist       consistently\n\nreported     worsening    pain    and     fatigue,        but     the    \u201cconditions\n\nidentified by testing, such as thyroid goiter, a joint effusion,\n\nand anterior cardiac wall soft tissue attenuation [were] not\n\ncorrelating with symptoms that are at a severity to limit [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nfunction,\u201d nor were they \u201cexpected to generate the fatigue and\n\ngeneralized pain symptoms reported by [Ovist].\u201d                       Malan-Elzawahry\n\ndeferred to Unum\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Scott Norris, for\n\nfurther, independent analysis of the appeal.\n\n             On January 21, 2016, Dr. Norris concluded that Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional     limitations       were     \u201cbased    on      [Ovist\u2019s]        reported\n\n[symptoms]    and   [were]     not   consistent      with        the    minimal     and\n\nnonspecific findings documented on examinations or the diagnostic\n\n\n                                     - 21 -\n\ftesting/imaging    studies       included     in     the   file   records.\u201d        He\n\nelaborated on this conclusion, noting, for example, that \u201cmultiple\n\nlaboratory     tests     were    negative      for     infections,       metabolic,\n\nimmunologic, hematologic, inflammatory, or other verifiable causes\n\nof   [Ovist\u2019s]   reported       fatigue\u201d;    Ovist\u2019s       \u201c[r]ecords    [did]    not\n\ncatalogue    examinations       or   testing       consistent     with    cognitive\n\nimpairment related to physical conditions\u201d; Ovist\u2019s February 2015\n\ncardiac tests were normal; and \u201calthough [Ovist] reported mold\n\nexposure in her home, the records do not reveal evidence of\n\nimpairment related to mold.\u201d\n\n            Finally, Dr. Norris expressed reservations about Ovist\u2019s\n\nCPET results. He wrote that the September 2015 CPET was not \u201ctime-\n\nrelevant regarding [Ovist\u2019s] functional capacity as of February\n\n2015,\u201d the date when Unum closed Ovist\u2019s claim.                 He also indicated\n\nthat Ovist did not \u201cexhibit maximal effort\u201d at certain points of\n\nthe CPET, meaning that \u201ca true . . . maximal aerobic capacity[]\n\nwas not measured.\u201d\n\n            Unum denied Ovist\u2019s appeal in a letter dated January 27,\n\n2016, concluding that the SRS limitation applied to Ovist\u2019s claim.\n\nIn the letter, Unum repeated Dr. Norris\u2019s conclusion that her\n\nreported     impairing    symptoms     and     her     functional        loss    were\n\n\u201cinconsistent with and/or not supported\u201d by clinical examinations,\n\ndiagnostic findings, or other objectively verifiable evidence in\n\nher file.    Unum listed examples: there was no \u201ccorrelation between\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\f. . .

Procedural History\n\n          On August 2, 2017, following the adverse determination\n\non her administrative appeal, Ovist initiated an ERISA action in\n\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging\n\nthat Unum unlawfully terminated her benefits.   On August 30, 2019,\n\nthe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. A magistrate\n\njudge issued a Report and Recommendation on February 24, 2020,\n\nrecommending that the district court grant Unum\u2019s motion and deny\n\nOvist\u2019s motion.\n\n          In the Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge\n\nfirst determined that Ovist, as the claimant, bears the burden to\n\nprove that the SRS limitation does not apply to her claim.   Then,\n\nhe found that Unum acted reasonably, under the terms of the Plan\n\nand this circuit\u2019s precedent, when it terminated Ovist\u2019s benefits\n\nunder the SRS limitation based on a finding that Ovist\u2019s impairing\n\nsymptoms, such as pain and fatigue, were based on her self-\n\nreporting, as opposed to objectively verifiable diagnostic or\n\nother tests.   The magistrate judge relied, in particular, on case\n\nlaw from this court establishing that it is unreasonable for an\n\ninsurer to require a claimant to provide objective evidence of\n\ndiagnoses that do not lend themselves to objective verification,\n\n\n\n\n                              - 24 -\n\fbut an insurer can reasonably require objective evidence of a\n\nclaimant\u2019s resulting functional limitations.\n\n           In March 2020, Ovist filed an objection to the Report\n\nand Recommendation, and Unum filed a reply.     The district court\n\nadopted the Report and Recommendation in full on March 27, 2020.\n\nThis timely appeal followed. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\n           We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.   Arruda v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 951 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2020).   When the underlying plan affords the insurer discretion to\n\ndetermine eligibility for benefits, \u201c[a] federal court reviews an\n\ninsurer\u2019s termination decision \u2018under a deferential arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard . . . .\u201d    Cook v.

Co., 230 F.3d 415, 418 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n           Here, the parties do not dispute that the Plan grants\n\ndiscretionary authority to Unum.   The Plan expressly \u201cdelegates to\n\nUnum and its affiliate Unum Group discretionary authority to make\n\nbenefit determinations under the Plan,\u201d including \u201cdetermining\n\neligibility for benefits and the amount of any benefits, resolving\n\nfactual disputes, and interpreting and enforcing the provisions of\n\nthe Plan.\u201d   Accordingly, we will review Unum\u2019s benefit decision\n\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard, as the district court\n\ndid.\n\n\n                               - 25 -\n\f             Under this standard, \u201cwe need not decide what is the\n\nbest reading of the words in the insurance policy.\u201d                  Stamp v.\n\nMetro.

LTD Plan, 705 F.3d 58, 61 (1st\n\nCir.2013)).     \u201c\u2018Substantial    evidence\u2019   is    \u2018evidence    reasonably\n\nsufficient to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d          Arruda, 951 F.3d at 21\n\n(quoting Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)). Importantly, a conclusion can still be supported\n\nby substantial evidence if contrary evidence exists.           See Boardman\n\nv. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 337 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).              In\n\nshort,   we    must   uphold    Unum\u2019s   determination   unless       it   was\n\n\u201cunreasonable in light of the information available\u201d to Unum.\n\nPari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 419.\n\n\n\n\n     9  In ERISA cases in which the plan administrator has\ndiscretion to make benefits determinations, we have variously\ndescribed the standard of review as review for \u201cabuse of\ndiscretion,\u201d \u201carbitrariness and capriciousness,\u201d and \u201csubstantial\nevidence.\u201d These terms are interchangeable in this context. See,\ne.g., McDonough, 783 F.3d at 379 (\u201cA court that undertakes abuse\nof discretion review in an ERISA case must determine whether the\nclaims administrator\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious or,\nlooked at from another angle, whether that decision is reasonable\nand supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                   - 26 -\n\fIII. Analysis\n\n            Unum approved Ovist\u2019s long-term disability claim in 2011\n\ndue to her symptoms related to CFS.     In its initial determination\n\nletter, Unum notified Ovist that her benefit payments would cease\n\nafter 24 months under the SRS limitation, which         applies, in\n\npertinent part, to disabilities \u201cbased primarily on self-reported\n\nsymptoms,\u201d including \u201cheadaches, pain, fatigue, . . . and loss of\n\nenergy.\u201d    Roughly 43 months later, in its final adverse benefit\n\ndetermination letter, Unum maintained that the SRS limitation\n\napplied to her claim because Ovist\u2019s functional limitations were\n\nsupported by her reports of pain and fatigue, rather than clinical\n\nexaminations, diagnostic findings, or other objectively verifiable\n\nevidence.\n\n            Ovist primarily challenges Unum\u2019s interpretation and\n\napplication of the SRS limitation as follows.     She argues that it\n\nwas unreasonable for Unum to require objective evidence of her\n\nfunctional loss after concluding that she was unable to work.     In\n\nthe alternative, she claims that she did provide the requested\n\nevidence\u2014her CPET results\u2014and Unum rejected the results \u201con the\n\nflimsiest of grounds.\u201d      Next, Ovist contends that the Seventh\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of a provision almost\n\nidentical to the SRS limitation, in Weitzenkamp, should control,\n\n\n\n\n                               - 27 -\n\fand the SRS limitation does not apply to her claim under the\n\nholding in Weitzenkamp.      We consider each challenge in turn.10\n\nA. Unum\u2019s Objective Evidence Requirement is Reasonable\n\n            To begin, Ovist contends that it was unreasonable for\n\nUnum to require objective proof of her functional limitations after\n\nconclusively determining that she was unable to work.                  This\n\nargument fails under settled precedent within this circuit, which\n\nwe revisit below.\n\n            We have repeatedly held that it is unreasonable for an\n\ninsurer to require objective evidence in support of diagnoses,\n\nlike fibromyalgia and CFS, which are not subject to objective\n\nverification.    See Denmark v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. Of Bos., 481\n\nF.3d 16, 37 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that it is unreasonable\n\nfor   an   insurer   \u201cto   require    objective   evidence   to   support   a\n\ndiagnosis of a condition that is not subject to verification\n\nthrough laboratory testing[,]\u201d and identifying fibromyalgia as one\n\nsuch condition), vacated on other grounds, 566 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Cook, 320 F.3d at 21-22 (finding it unreasonable for the\n\n\n       Ovist also challenges the district court\u2019s holding that she\n      10\n\nbears the burden to prove that the SRS limitation does not apply\nto her claim, arguing instead that the burden of proof lies with\nUnum. We need not decide this issue because it will not affect\nthe outcome of this case. Under the applicable standard of review,\nwe must determine whether Unum\u2019s decision is \u201creasonable and\nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d McDonough, 783 F.3d at 379\n(citing Colby, 705 F.3d at 61).       As discussed below, Unum\u2019s\ndecision passes muster under this standard, regardless of where we\nplace the burden of proof.\n\n\n                                     - 28 -\n\finsurer to expect the claimant to provide \u201cconvincing \u2018clinical\n\nobjective\u2019 evidence that she was suffering from CFS\u201d because there\n\nare no accepted laboratory tests associated with the condition).\n\n           In Boardman v. Prudential Insurance Company of America,\n\nhowever,   we    drew     a    distinction       between     requiring   objective\n\nevidence of conditions that do not lend themselves to objective\n\nverification and requiring objective evidence of the functional\n\nlimitations resulting from a claimant\u2019s conditions.                    337 F.3d at\n\n16-17 & n.5.     We held that the latter is permissible.\n\n           The claimant in Boardman presented varying diagnoses of\n\nconditions that are associated with pain and fatigue, including\n\nCFS and myalgias.       Id. at 12-14 & n.4.           She was granted long-term\n\ndisability benefits upon showing that \u201cdue to her illness, she was\n\nunable to perform the duties of her job . . . .\u201d                    Id. at 11.     In\n\norder to remain eligible for benefits after the first 24 months of\n\npayments, the claimant needed to show \u201cthat she was disabled from\n\nduties of \u2018any job for which [she was] reasonably fitted . . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nId. at 13. Though the plan administrator, Prudential, \u201cwas willing\n\nto accept that [the claimant] suffered from the illnesses she\n\nreported to her doctors[,]\u201d it terminated the claimant\u2019s benefits,\n\nin   pertinent    part,       because    her   file    did    not   indicate     \u201cany\n\nlimitations or restrictions, based on objective findings, that\n\nwould preclude [her] from performing any occupation for which she\n\nis suited.\u201d      Id. at 15, 16 n.5.        We affirmed the district court\u2019s\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fgrant of summary judgment to Prudential, reasoning that, \u201cwhile\n\nthe diagnoses of [CFS] and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to\n\nobjective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed by\n\nthe    symptoms       of    such    illnesses       lend   themselves    to   objective\n\nanalysis.\u201d       Id. at 16 n.5, 17.\n\n            We have since repeatedly invoked this principle and\n\nBoardman\u2019s diagnosis-disabling symptom distinction when reviewing\n\nplan    administrators\u2019            benefit    determinations.        See      Cusson   v.\n\nLiberty Life Assur. Co. of Bos., 592 F.3d 215, 227 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(observing that the plan administrator did not \u201cquestion the\n\ndiagnosis of fibromyalgia,\u201d but \u201cinstead . . . questioned the\n\neffect of the disease on [the claimant\u2019s] ability to work . . . .\n\nBecause    it     is       permissible       to    require   documented,      objective\n\nevidence of disability, it was not inappropriate for [the plan\n\nadministrator] to rely on the lack of such documented evidence, or\n\non the footage that contradicted [the claimant\u2019s] reports of\n\nlimitations, in making their recommendations\u201d that the plaintiff\n\nwas able to work and thus not disabled under the terms of the\n\nplan), abrogated on other grounds by Montanile v. Bd. of Trustees\n\nof Nat. Elevator Indus. Health Benefit Plan, 577 U.S. 136 (2016);\n\nDenmark, 481 F.3d at 37 (holding that the plan administrator acted\n\n\u201cwithin the parameters defined in Boardman\u201d when it required the\n\nclaimant,       who    was     diagnosed          with   fibromyalgia,   to    \u201cprovide\n\nobjective evidence of functional limitations or restrictions that\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\fwould prevent her from working\u201d in order to qualify for long-term\n\ndisability benefits).          Here, we endorse our holding in Boardman\n\nonce again and conclude that it was reasonable for Unum to require\n\nobjective proof of Ovist\u2019s functional loss.11\n\n              Ovist attempts to escape this outcome by emphasizing\n\nthat,      prior   to   imposing   this    evidentiary   requirement,   Unum\n\nrepeatedly found that Ovist was unable to work and did not harbor\n\nany     suspicions      that   Ovist     was    falsifying   her   functional\n\nlimitations.       This argument is misplaced, as it constitutes an\n\nobjection to the design of the Plan\u2014over which the \u201demployer ha[s]\n\nlarge leeway\u201d\u2014rather than a viable challenge to the reasonableness\n\n\n      11We do acknowledge, as the district court did, that Unum\u2019s\nclaim log and correspondence with Ovist also intermittently\nfocused on the absence of objective evidence supporting her\ndiagnoses.    For example, in February and April 2015 letters\nnotifying Ovist that her benefits would be terminated under the\nSRS limitation, Unum stated that her functional limitations were\nassociated with fibromyalgia and CFS, two conditions that \u201cwere\nconsidered self-reported\u201d since they could not be confirmed by\n\u201cclinical signs\u201d or \u201cdiagnostic test findings.\u201d Relatedly, when\nUnum sought guidance from legal counsel on Ovist\u2019s claim, its\nquestion turned on Ovist\u2019s diagnosis, as opposed to her functional\nlimitations. Specifically, Unum asked counsel if it was legally\npermissible to apply the SRS limitation to a diagnosis of\nfibromyalgia. While these examples show an inconsistency in Unum\u2019s\nhandling of Ovist\u2019s claim, they are peripheral to our analysis on\nappeal.   This court\u2019s analysis centers on Unum\u2019s final adverse\nbenefit determination. See Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 35\n(1st Cir. 1998) (stating that the court \u201cmust focus, as in the\nusual case, on the determination of the final decision-maker\u201d when\nreviewing an appeal of the plan administrator\u2019s decision to\nterminate benefits). And in this case, Unum\u2019s medical question on\nappeal, subsequent internal analysis, and denial of Unum\u2019s appeal\nall primarily centered on the insufficient objective evidence of\nOvist\u2019s functional limitations.\n\n\n                                       - 31 -\n\fof Unum\u2019s benefit determination.        Black & Decker Disability Plan\n\nv.

The SRS limitation confines the benefit\n\nperiod to 24 months for the same, disabled individuals if they\n\nhave, in pertinent part, \u201cdisabilities based primarily on self-\n\nreported symptoms.\u201d      Unum simply followed the Plan\u2019s blueprint,\n\nthen, by first determining that Ovist was unable to work (and\n\nthereby granting her benefits), and then reasonably requiring\n\nobjective proof of her functional loss in order to determine if\n\nher disabilities were \u201cbased primarily on self-reported symptoms,\u201d\n\nand thus subject to the associated benefit limitation.         It follows\n\nthat Ovist takes issue with her employer\u2019s decision to establish\n\na different evidentiary hurdle (centered on objective evidence)\n\nfor claimants seeking to obtain benefits over the long term, as\n\nopposed to claimants seeking benefits for only 24 months or less.\n\nThis objection to the Plan\u2019s design does not alter our analysis\n\nunder Boardman.\n\nB. Unum\u2019s Denial of Long-term Disability              Benefits     on   the\n   Information Before it was Reasonable\n\n          Ovist   next    argues    that    Unum   reached   its   benefit\n\ndetermination by unreasonably rejecting her CPET results, which,\n\n\n\n                                   - 32 -\n\faccording to Ovist, provide objective proof of her functional\n\nlimitations.     Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, our\n\ntask is not to re-weigh the evidence in the record.            Instead, we\n\nmust uphold the plan administrator\u2019s decision if it \u201cis reasonable\n\nand supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d\n\nMcDonough, 783 F.3d at 379 (citing Colby, 705 F.3d at 61).              This\n\nalso means, however, that \u201c[p]lan administrators . . . may not\n\narbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant\u2019s reliable evidence[.]\u201d\n\nBlack & Decker Disability Plan, 538 U.S. at 834.            Upon reviewing\n\nthe record, we find that Unum\u2019s conclusion that Ovist\u2019s functional\n\nlimitations were \u201cinconsistent with and/or not supported based on\n\nclinical exam and/or diagnostic findings, procedures, and/or other\n\nclinical findings\u201d is both supported by substantial evidence and\n\nconsistent with a reasonable review of the record as a whole,\n\nincluding the CPET results.\n\n           To begin, Unum reviewed Ovist\u2019s file on at least five\n\nseparate occasions, allowing Ovist to supplement the file with\n\nmedical providers\u2019 opinions and other evidence in the interim.\n\nUnum also followed up with Ovist\u2019s physicians in order to obtain\n\nupdates   on   her   conditions   and   the   basis   of   their   opinions.\n\nFurther, Unum alerted Ovist to the absence of objective evidence\n\nof her functional limitations; for example, in a February 2015\n\nadverse benefit determination letter, Unum stated that Ovist\u2019s\n\n\u201cphysical examinations remain unremarkable,\u201d and \u201c[t]here had been\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\fno   diagnostic     testing    performed   to    explain   the     etiology   of\n\n[Ovist\u2019s]     complaints.\u201d        Still,     Unum\u2019s     medical    consultants\n\nrepeatedly found that there were no diagnostic findings or clinical\n\nexaminations explaining Ovist\u2019s consistent reports of pain and\n\nfatigue and her associated functional loss.\n\n             Dr. Broadwell was the first consultant to make this\n\nobservation, in 2011.      In 2013, Dr. Smith concluded that Ovist was\n\nunable to work based on her consistent complaints of pain and\n\nfatigue,     her   treatment    history,   Dr.   Hoffman\u2019s   report     of    her\n\nnarcotic dependence, observations from Unum\u2019s field visit, and her\n\n2012 SSDI award.      Dr. Smith did not base his conclusion, then, on\n\nany clinical exams, diagnostic findings, or objectively verifiable\n\nphysical exams evidencing Ovist\u2019s functional limitations.                Next,\n\nin   2014,    Nurse    Curran    determined      that    Ovist\u2019s    functional\n\nlimitations \u201cwere supported based on the consistency of [her]\n\ncomplaints,\u201d but \u201cthere was no physical basis to explain the\n\netiology of [those] complaints.\u201d\n\n             Only one of Ovist\u2019s doctors, Dr. Klimas, claimed that\n\nOvist\u2019s condition and/or symptoms were \u201cconfirmed by physical\n\nexamination . . . and laboratory data\u201d showing \u201cimpaired immune\n\nfunction . . . and latent virus reactivations.\u201d                  Two of Unum\u2019s\n\nmedical consultants considered and rejected Dr. Klimas\u2019s claim.\n\nDr. Bress noted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s tests for immune function and\n\nviruses were not \u201cstandard medical testing\u201d and/or were unrelated\n\n\n                                    - 34 -\n\fto Ovist\u2019s symptoms.            Dr. Hauser also asserted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s\n\ntests for viral infection provided evidence of past, but not\n\nongoing, infections.12              Dr. Hauser         accordingly concluded that\n\nOvist\u2019s      impairing     symptoms        were   not    \u201cattributable      to   (either\n\ndirectly or indirectly) viral infection, immune deficiency, or any\n\nother       verifiable     (through      physical       examination    or   diagnostic\n\ntesting) medical condition,\u201d and Dr. Bress concurred.\n\n               Unum\u2019s reviewers also considered other diagnostic and\n\nclinical exam findings and objectively verifiable evidence in\n\nUnum\u2019s file and found that they were normal and/or could not\n\nexplain       the    severity     of    Ovist\u2019s       disabling    symptoms      and   her\n\nresulting functional limitations.                      Malan-Elzawahry found that\n\nOvist\u2019s 2012 sleep study and 2015 cardiac tests did not identify\n\nconditions      or     symptoms     that      could    explain    Ovist\u2019s   functional\n\nlimitations.         Dr. Norris determined that Ovist\u2019s laboratory tests\n\nwere        negative      for       \u201cinfections,         metabolic,      hematologic,\n\ninflammatory, or other verifiable causes\u201d of Ovist\u2019s fatigue.                           He\n\nalso noted that Ovist\u2019s cardiac tests were normal, and no tests or\n\nexaminations         in   Ovist\u2019s      file    were    consistent    with   \u201ccognitive\n\nimpairment related to physical conditions.\u201d                       Finally, Dr. Bress,\n\nMalan-Elzawahry, and Dr. Norris reviewed Ovist\u2019s fungal report and\n\n\n        Consistent with this finding, when reviewing Ovist\u2019s\n       12\n\nadministrative appeal, Unum\u2019s Malan-Elzawahry also found that\nOvist\u2019s tests for viral illnesses, dating back to 2006, did not\nprovide evidence of current infections.\n\n\n                                           - 35 -\n\fthe mold analysis of her home and agreed that there was no known\n\nassociation between mold or fungus exposure and Ovist\u2019s disabling\n\nsymptoms.\n\n            Ovist does not dispute Unum\u2019s assessment of the evidence\n\nabove.    Rather, Ovist points to her September 2015 CPET results as\n\nthe   singular    source    of    objective      proof    of    her   functional\n\nlimitations, and she argues that Unum rejected the CPET results on\n\n\u201cthe flimsiest of grounds.\u201d        We disagree.\n\n            Unum\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Norris, reviewed the CPET\n\nresults and concluded that the test was not time-relevant and did\n\nnot reflect Ovist\u2019s maximal effort.              Dr. Norris\u2019s assessment of\n\nOvist\u2019s   maximal      effort   was,    at   least   in   part,    supported   by\n\nCournoyer\u2019s own statement that Ovist \u201cdemonstrated maximal effort\n\nin some, but not all of the testing measures.\u201d                 On the other side\n\nof the ledger, Cournoyer opined that the tests on both days were\n\n\u201cof maximal nature.\u201d       His report lists respiratory, metabolic, and\n\nother markers showing that Ovist experienced fatigue and cognitive\n\nimpairment following physical activity on both days.                   And Ovist\n\nargues    that   the    seven-month      gap    between   the     February   2015\n\ntermination of her claim and the administration of the CPET is not\n\nmeaningful because there is no evidence that her symptoms changed\n\nduring that period.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\f           When considering the CPET,13 Unum credited Dr. Norris\u2019s\n\nopinion over Cournoyer\u2019s findings. We have \u201ctreated a nonexamining\n\nphysician\u2019s    review   of   a   claimant\u2019s    file   as    reliable    medical\n\nevidence on several occasions,\u201d Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n360 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing cases), and we find no\n\nbasis on the record to conclude that Dr. Norris\u2019s opinion is\n\nunreliable.    Thus, Dr. Norris\u2019s critique of the CPET provides a\n\nreasonable basis for Unum to find that the CPET results alone did\n\nnot compensate for the considerable absence in the record of\n\nobjective evidence of Ovist\u2019s functional loss, and therefore to\n\nconclude that Ovist\u2019s \u201cfunctional limitation was based primarily\n\non self-reported pain and fatigue.\u201d           This conclusion holds, even\n\nthough the CPET arguably provides some objective proof of Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional loss.     See Boardman, 337 F.3d at 15 (\u201cThe existence of\n\ncontrary   evidence     does     not   necessarily     render    [the     claim\n\nadministrator\u2019s]        decision       arbitrary      and     capricious.\u201d).\n\nAccordingly,    we   conclude      that,   notwithstanding      Ovist\u2019s    CPET\n\nresults, Unum\u2019s decision to apply the SRS limitation to Ovist\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n     13 We use the term \u2018considering\u2019 instead of \u2018rejecting\u2019\nbecause it is not clear, based on Unum\u2019s final adverse benefit\ndetermination letter, that Unum discredited the CPET results\nentirely.   Rather, Unum noted that the results were not time-\nrelevant, and that Ovist did not exhibit full effort on all of the\ntests. Then, Unum concluded that, \u201c[r]egardless of [Cournoyer\u2019s]\nfindings[,]\u201d Ovist\u2019s \u201cfunctional limitation is based primarily[,]\u201d\nthough not necessarily wholly, \u201con self-reported pain and\nfatigue.\u201d\n\n\n                                    - 37 -\n\fclaim was reasonable and rests on substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord as a whole.14\n\nC. The Seventh Circuit Weitzenkamp Test is in Conflict With First\n   Circuit Law\n\n            Having found that Unum\u2019s decision to terminate Ovist\u2019s\n\nbenefits was reasonable under this circuit\u2019s precedent, we are\n\nunconvinced by Ovist\u2019s argument that Unum\u2019s application of the SRS\n\nlimitation    is   improper   because   this   court   should   adopt   the\n\nstandards under Weitzenkamp, a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals\n\ndecision.    In Weitzenkamp, the court interpreted an SRS limitation\n\nalmost identical to the one at bar.        Under the SRS limitation in\n\nWeitzenkamp, benefits ceased after 24 months for individuals with\n\n\u201cdisabilities, due to sickness or injury, which are primarily based\n\non self-reported symptoms, and disabilities due to mental illness,\n\nalcoholism or drug abuse.\u201d       661 F.3d at 326-27.       Self-reported\n\nsymptoms are also defined identically in the plan in Weitzenkamp\n\nand the Plan in this case.      Id. at 327.\n\n\n\n\n     14 Ovist also argues that Unum unreasonably applied the SRS\nlimitation to her claim based on her mental illness. Since the\nSRS limitation, by its terms, applies to \u201cany combination\u201d of\n\u201cdisabilities due to mental illness and disabilities based\nprimarily on self-reported symptoms,\u201d Unum can reasonably apply\nthe limitation when only one of the categories of disabilities is\npresent. Since we already determined that Unum reasonably applied\nthe limitation after completing more than 24 months of payments\nfor the second category of \u201cdisabilities based primarily on self-\nreported symptoms,\u201d we need not consider whether it was also\nreasonable to apply the limitation under the first category of\ndisabilities \u201cdue to mental illness.\u201d\n\n\n                                 - 38 -\n\f           The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the\n\nSRS limitation \u201capplies to disabling illnesses or injuries that\n\nare diagnosed primarily based on self-reported symptoms rather\n\nthan to all illnesses or injuries for which disabling symptoms are\n\nself-reported.\u201d     Id. at 330 (emphasis in original).           The court\n\nnoted that, if the SRS limitation applied to the latter category\n\nof conditions, it would limit benefits for individuals with most\n\nany disease with symptoms such as pain, weakness, and fatigue\u2014\n\nsymptoms which \u201care difficult if not impossible to verify using\n\nobjective medical evidence.\u201d     Id.     The court then determined that\n\nthe   plaintiff\u2019s   diagnosis   of     fibromyalgia   was     supported   by\n\nobjective evidence in the form of a positive tender point exam,\n\nand thus the SRS limitation did not apply.            Id. at 331.     Ovist\n\nposits that the same outcome should follow here, as she was\n\npositive for at least 11 of 18 tender points when examined, and\n\nthis circuit has determined that the tender or trigger points\n\nprovide   \u201cthe   clinical   findings    necessary   for   a   diagnosis   of\n\nfibromyalgia under established medical guidelines[.]\u201d            Johnson v.\n\nAstrue, 597 F.3d 409, 412 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Respectfully, we decline to follow the reasoning and\n\nholding in Weitzenkamp, as they are in tension with this circuit\u2019s\n\nlong-held diagnosis-disabling symptom distinction as articulated\n\nin Boardman, and the underlying principle that \u201cthe physical\n\nlimitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses [as CFS and\n\n\n                                 - 39 -\n\ffibromyalgia],\u201d including pain and fatigue, do \u201clend themselves to\n\nobjective analysis.\u201d   Boardman, 337 F.3d at 16 n.4.   Accordingly,\n\neven if we accept that Ovist tested positive for fibromyalgia based\n\non tender points, we still conclude that it was reasonable for\n\nUnum to require that Ovist provide objective evidence of her\n\nfunctional limitations, and to apply the SRS limitation based on\n\nthe relative absence of this evidence.\n\n          We also find Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement to be\n\nreasonable (contrary to the conclusion in Weitzenkamp) for at least\n\ntwo reasons.   First, it merely calls for the claimant to establish\n\na causal connection between his or her disability and his or her\n\nalleged functional limitation(s) before being awarded long-term\n\ndisability benefits beyond 24 months.    Far from being arbitrary or\n\ncapricious, this type of inquiry into causation is often necessary\n\nfor a claim administrator to ensure that benefits are paid as\n\nintended by the operative policy.   See, e.g., Arruda, 951 F.3d at\n\n21-22 (finding that the claimant was not eligible for death\n\nbenefits under an insurance policy issued for accidental death or\n\ninjury, since substantial evidence in the record supported the\n\nconclusion that the death was caused or contributed to by the\n\ndecedent\u2019s pre-existing health conditions).      In this case, the\n\ncausal connection must be established to confirm that Ovist is\n\nunable to work due to her recognized, diagnosed medical conditions,\n\nas opposed to her unverifiable perceptions.\n\n\n                               - 40 -\n\f             Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement is also reasonable\n\nbecause it furthers the purpose of the SRS limitation, as defined\n\nby   Unum.         Under   the    terms    of    the   Plan,     Unum   \u201cha[s]   the\n\ndiscretionary authority to construe the [P]lan\u201d; thus, Unum also\n\n\u201cha[s] the discretion to determine the intended meaning of the\n\n[P]lan\u2019s terms.\u201d           Stamp, 531 F.3d at 93-94 (internal quotation\n\nomitted). And according to Unum, the purpose of the SRS limitation\n\nis \u201cto address conditions\u201d that manifest themselves in a manner\n\nthat renders the           resulting functional limitations \u201cinherently\n\ndifficult to determine.\u201d             It should not be deemed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, then, for Unum to further this goal by requiring\n\nobjective evidence of Ovist\u2019s functional limitations, as such\n\nevidence is a more reliable indicator of the severity of Ovist\u2019s\n\nlimitations than her self-reporting of pain and fatigue.                     Unum\u2019s\n\nrequirement is particularly reasonable here, where Ovist had the\n\nopportunity to take the CPET, a test that can provide objective\n\nevidence of her functional limitations, but she failed to do so in\n\na timely manner.           Ultimately, we do not adopt Weitzenkamp, and\n\ninstead adhere to this circuit\u2019s law and conclude that Unum\u2019s\n\ninterpretation        of    the   SRS     limitation      is   not   arbitrary    or\n\ncapricious.\n\nIV.

This     case   involves      a\n\ndispute over the applicability of a self-reported symptoms benefit\n\nlimitation provision to a long-term disability claim.              Plaintiff-\n\nappellant Rhonda Ovist is a participant in her employer\u2019s long-\n\nterm   disability     plan   (\u201cthe    Plan\u201d),     which    is    insured    and\n\nadministered by defendant-appellee Unum Life Insurance Company of\n\nAmerica and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 et. seq.                 Ovist, who suffers\n\nfrom   Chronic   Fatigue     Syndrome        (\u201cCFS\u201d),     fibromyalgia,      and\n\nassociated   symptoms    including     pain    and   fatigue,    was   granted\n\nbenefits under the Plan in 2011.

We accordingly\n\naffirm the entry of summary judgment to Unum.2\n\nI. Facts\n\n           Ovist began working as a sociology professor at Rollins\n\nCollege in 1999.   Her responsibilities included teaching, advising\n\nstudents, developing courses, grading papers, and researching and\n\nwriting.   In its claim log, Unum noted that Ovist began reporting\n\nand seeking treatment for \u201csevere fatigue and generalized diffuse\n\npain in 2003,\u201d and she was treated with narcotics and \u201cseveral\n\ncourses of antiviral agents.\u201d         Ovist\u2019s complaints of pain and\n\nfatigue continued over the years. Rollins College approved Ovist\u2019s\n\nrequest for short-term disability leave from January 9, 2011 to\n\nJune 1, 2011, based on diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome\n\n(\u201cCFS\u201d), cytomegaloviral illness, sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis,\n\n\n\n\n     2 The Secretary of Labor filed a brief in this case as amicus\ncuriae. In the brief, the Secretary supports placing the burden\non the plan, and not the plan participant, to prove the\napplicability of a benefit limitation, such as the SRS limitation.\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the Secretary\u2019s assistance in this\ncase.\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fand   parvovirus.     In   June     2011,    Ovist   applied   for   long-term\n\ndisability benefits under the Plan.\n\nA. Relevant Terms of the Plan\n\n            The Plan \u201cdelegates to Unum . . . discretionary authority\n\nto make benefit determinations under the Plan[,] . . . includ[ing]\n\ndetermining    eligibility    for    benefits    and   the     amount   of   any\n\nbenefits,     resolving    factual    disputes,      and   interpreting      and\n\nenforcing the provisions of the Plan.\u201d An individual is considered\n\n\u201cdisabled\u201d and eligible for benefits under the Plan when she is\n\n\u201climited from performing the material and substantial duties of\n\n[her] regular occupation due to [her] sickness or injury; and [has]\n\na 20% or more loss in [her] indexed monthly earnings due to the\n\nsame sickness or injury.\u201d\n\n            This    case   centers     on     Unum\u2019s    interpretation       and\n\napplication of the SRS limitation, a provision of the Plan that\n\nlimits the benefit period to 24 months for certain disabilities.\n\nThe SRS limitation provides:\n\n            The lifetime cumulative maximum benefit period\n            for all disabilities due to mental illness and\n            disabilities based primarily on self-reported\n            symptoms is 24 months.     Only 24 months of\n            benefits will be paid for any combination of\n            such disabilities even if the disabilities:\n            are not continuous; and/or are not related.\n\n        The Plan defines mental illness as:\n\n            A psychiatric or psychological condition\n            classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical\n            Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM},\n\n\n                                     - 6 -\n\f           published   by   the   American   Psychiatric\n           Association, most current as of the start of\n           a disability. Such disorders include, but are\n           not limited to, psychotic, emotional or\n           behavioral disorders, or disorders relatable\n           to stress.\n\n         And the Plan defines self-reported symptoms as:\n\n           The manifestations of your condition which you\n           tell your physician, that are not verifiable\n           using    tests,   procedures    or    clinical\n           examinations standardly accepted in the\n           practice of medicine. Examples of self-\n           reported symptoms include, but are not limited\n           to headaches, pain, fatigue, stiffness,\n           soreness, ringing in ears, dizziness, numbness\n           and loss of energy.\n\nB. First Review of Disability Claim\n\n           Ovist submitted her long-term disability claim form in\n\nJune 2011, listing CFS as the illness causing her disability.      In\n\nan accompanying Attending Physician Statement, Ovist\u2019s primary\n\ncare physician, Dr. John Hudson, confirmed that CFS is the \u201cprimary\n\ndiagnosis preventing the patient from working[.]\u201d     He also listed\n\nsecondary diagnoses of Parvovirus3 and fibromyalgia,4 along with\n\n\n     3  According to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cmost people with parvovirus\ninfection have no signs or symptoms. When symptoms do appear, they\nvary greatly depending on how old you are when you get the disease.\u201d\nFor adults, \u201c[t]he most noticeable symptom of parvovirus infection .\n. . is joint soreness lasting days to weeks.\u201d Mayo Clinic, Parvovirus\ninfection, at https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-\nconditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085.\n     4  According to the National Institute of Health, fibromyalgia\nis \u201ca long-lasting or chronic disorder that causes muscle pain and\nfatigue,\u201d and \u201c[t]he symptoms of fibromyalgia are pain and\ntenderness throughout your body.\u201d National Institute of Health,\nFibromyalgia, at https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/fibromyalgia.\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\fthe following symptoms: severe chronic fatigue, severe muscle and\n\njoint pain, dizziness, insomnia, depression, and \u201cunclear mental\n\nclarity, or brain fog[.]\u201d\n\n            The   following   month,     on    July   15,   2011,   Dr.   Hudson\n\ncompleted a detailed assessment of Ovist, in which he repeated\n\nmany of the same diagnoses and symptoms, along with acute and\n\nchronic sinusitis,     opioid withdrawal,          chronic bronchitis,       and\n\nvarious viral infections.        Dr. Hudson indicated that he referred\n\nOvist to Dr. Nancy Klimas, a chronic fatigue specialist, for a\n\nsecond opinion on CFS and fibromyalgia.\n\n            In an Initial Progress Note dated July 29, 2011, Dr.\n\nKlimas wrote that Ovist is \u201cvery disabled . . . with [symptoms]\n\nconsistent with CFS.\u201d         Dr. Klimas prescribed a sleep study to\n\ndetermine the presence of apnea and ordered lab tests for \u201cimmune\n\nactivation, function, [and] cytokines.\u201d\n\n            In August 2011, Unum sent letters to three of Ovist\u2019s\n\nphysicians\u2014Dr. Kent Hoffman, who treated Ovist for pain and opioid\n\ndependence; Dr. Klimas; and Dr. Cory Baill, a gynecologist who\n\nbegan    treating   Ovist   as   early    as    2002\u2014to     ask   whether   they\n\nrestricted Ovist from completing her work, which, according to\n\nUnum\u2019s    Vocational   Rehabilitation          Consultant,    involved      light\n\nphysical demands.      Specifically, Unum asked the doctors if they\n\n\u201crestrict Ms. Ovist from performing full time work [that includes]\n\nsitting up to frequently and standing/walking up to frequently;\n\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fexerting 20 [pounds] of force occasionally or ten [pounds] of force\n\nfrequently, and/or a negligible amount of force constantly to lift,\n\ncarry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects, including the human\n\nbody[.]\u201d     Each doctor confirmed that Ovist could not work under\n\nthe physical demands listed.\n\n            On September 1, 2011, Dr. Freeman Broadwell, a medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and found that she\n\nconsistently reported pain and fatigue and received treatment for\n\nthese symptoms from multiple providers over several years.                      Dr.\n\nBroadwell did not find, however, that the \u201cexistence, intensity,\n\nfrequency,       and    duration   of    chronic   pain    and   fatigue   [were]\n\nconsistent with the clinical examination / diagnostic findings.\u201d\n\nNor did he find from Ovist\u2019s work-up that chronic infection or any\n\nother physical condition could explain a level of impairment that\n\nrendered Ovist unable to work. Dr. Broadwell nonetheless concluded\n\nthat \u201c[d]ue to the consistency of [Ovist\u2019s] reports\u201d of chronic\n\npain and fatigue \u201ccorroborated by her providers and absence of\n\nevidence to the contrary, the [restrictions and limitations] of no\n\nwork are supported.\u201d\n\n            In a letter dated September 13, 2011, Unum approved\n\nOvist\u2019s    claim       for   long-term   disability      benefits   \u201cdue   to   the\n\nsymptoms related to [her] medical condition of [CFS].\u201d                Unum noted\n\nthat her file shows that she had \u201cconsistently reported and been\n\ntreated    for    self-reported      complaints     of    chronic   fatigue     and\n\n\n                                         - 9 -\n\fchronic diffuse pain,\u201d and added that the Plan \u201climit[s] [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nbenefits to 24 months due to [her] medical condition of [CFS].\u201d\n\nConsequently, Unum provided an end date of June 29, 2013 for\n\nOvist\u2019s benefit payments.\n\nC. Second Review of Disability Claim\n\n           During 2012 and 2013, Ovist\u2019s physicians and Unum\u2019s\n\nPersonal Visit Consultant documented the persistence of Ovist\u2019s\n\nconditions and symptoms. In a status update dated January 6, 2012,\n\nDr. Klimas observed that Ovist continued to have physical and\n\ncognitive impairments, and that her pain was a \u201cvery serious issue\n\n. . . requiring increasing levels of pain med[ications].\u201d                   She\n\nprovided   a   primary   diagnosis   of    immune    deficiency     based   on\n\n\u201claboratory testing demonstrat[ing] poor cellular function . . . ,\n\nproinflammatory cytokine expression, [and] serology consistent\n\nwith   viral   reactivation.\u201d    Dr.      Klimas    also   listed   secondary\n\ndiagnoses of fatigue and fibromyalgia.        On May 4, 2012, Dr. Klimas\n\nreported no improvement in Ovist\u2019s functional capacity and advised\n\nthat Ovist have \u201cunrestricted access to rest\u201d and \u201cavoid exposure\n\nto community acquired infections.\u201d\n\n           On May 14, 2012, Unum\u2019s Personal Visit Consultant, Mark\n\nCox, conducted a field visit with Ovist.           Cox noted in his report\n\nthat Ovist remained seated throughout the visit, and he \u201cdid not\n\nobserve the insured display any physical signs of pain / discomfort\n\nwhile she was seated . . . .\u201d          But Cox also found that Ovist\n\n\n                                - 10 -\n\f\u201cappeared tired and fatigued throughout the entire field visit,\u201d\n\n\u201cappeared to have some difficulty staying focused on the topics\n\nbeing discussed,\u201d and occasionally slurred her speech.            A couple\n\nmonths later, in response to a request for information from Unum,\n\nDr.   Hoffman   opined   that   Ovist\u2019s    diagnoses   were   chronic   pain\n\nsyndrome, fibromyalgia, and opioid dependence.         He maintained that\n\nOvist was unable to work.\n\n           Ovist\u2019s behavioral health issues also begin to appear in\n\nthe record during this time period.           Around August 2012, Ovist\n\nbegan seeing a clinical psychologist, Dr. Catherine Segota.             That\n\nsame month, Ovist submitted a form to the Florida Department of\n\nHealth, in which she reported experiencing daily panic and/or\n\nanxiety attacks that lasted from 15 minutes to hours.          Roughly one\n\nmonth later, on September 14, 2012, Ovist was awarded social\n\nsecurity disability insurance (\u201cSSDI\u201d) benefits retroactive to\n\nApril 2012.     The Social Security Administration determined that\n\nOvist was disabled as of October 26, 2011, with diagnoses of \u201cother\n\nunspecified arthropathy\u201d5 and \u201canxiety related disorder.\u201d\n\n           On July 19, 2013, Dr. Tony Smith, a medical consultant\n\nfor Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and wrote that multiple specialists\n\n\n      According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, arthropathy is \u201ca\n      5\n\njoint disease, of which arthritis is a type,\u201d and its symptoms\ninclude \u201cjoint swelling, stiffness[,] [and] reduced range of\nmotion.\u201d Johns Hopkins Medicine, Arthropathy, at\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-\ndiseases/arthropathy.\n\n\n                                  - 11 -\n\fdiagnosed Ovist with CFS, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain syndrome,\n\nthough \u201c[n]o specific etiology for the opined diagnoses has been\n\nestablished to date.\u201d   Dr. Smith determined that \u201cthe medical data\n\ndocumenting   Ovist\u2019s   consistent    complaints,\u201d      Ovist\u2019s   level   of\n\ntreatment, Dr. Hoffman\u2019s report of narcotic dependence, Cox\u2019s\n\ndescription of Ovist\u2019s lack of focus and slurred speech, and the\n\n2012 SSDI award \u201creasonably support[] a finding that Ms. Ovist may\n\nhave difficulty working in a sedentary or light capacity on a\n\nconsistent    basis.\u201d    He   added   that    Ovist\u2019s    \u201cimprovement     is\n\nreasonable and expected,\u201d and he suggested a follow-up with Ovist\n\nin 8-12 months.\n\n          Unum\u2019s claim log indicates that, on July 22, 2013, Unum\n\nnotified Ovist over the phone that her claim would undergo further\n\nreview and her benefits would continue, though the initial 24-\n\nmonth benefit period had passed in June.         Unum also conveyed to\n\nOvist that it still found that she was unable to work, but\n\nimprovement was reasonable and expected.        The following day, Unum\n\nnoted in the claim log that Ovist\u2019s file was transferred to the\n\nSpecial Benefits Unit CORE section, and the next steps were an\n\nannual telephone call with Ovist and a medical update in 12 months.\n\nOne year later, in June 2014, Ovist\u2019s file was \u201creassign[ed]\u201d from\n\nthe CORE to the \u201cComp.\u201d section, \u201cto hold\u201d the annual telephone\n\ncall with Ovist, \u201crequest records,\u201d review her eligibility, and\n\n\u201cdiscuss[] [] the SR[S] limitation.\u201d         Ovist asserts, based on an\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\faffidavit from an employee of Unum, that the CORE section manages\n\nclaims pertaining to conditions that are unlikely to improve, and\n\nthe \u201cComp.\u201d section \u201cmanages claims with great scrutiny.\u201d\n\nD. Third Review of Disability Claim\n\n             In August and September 2014, Unum reached out to Ovist\u2019s\n\ntreatment providers, Dr. Deborah Dube, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Segota,\n\nand Dr. Klimas, requesting updates on Ovist\u2019s conditions and\n\nfunctional limitations.      Dr. Dube, Dr. Hoffman, and Dr. Segota\n\nresponded to Unum in November 2014.        Dr. Klimas\u2019s response reached\n\nUnum after it completed its third review of Ovist\u2019s claim, and\n\nUnum considered it in its next review, as discussed further below.\n\n             Dr. Dube, who treated Ovist for fatigue, generalized\n\npain, and chronic sinus infections, stated that she was unable to\n\nprovide information on Ovist\u2019s functional capacity because her\n\noffice did not perform functional capacity testing.             Dr. Hoffman\n\nmaintained that Ovist\u2019s primary diagnoses were fibromyalgia and\n\nchronic pain syndrome, and her secondary diagnosis was opioid\n\ndependence.     He explained that Ovist was still unable to work\n\nbecause her \u201cmental and physical capacities are very time limited\n\nand easily exhausted.\u201d      Finally, Dr. Segota noted that she met\n\nwith Ovist on fifteen occasions in the previous two years, and\n\nthat   she    diagnosed   Ovist   with     major   depressive     disorder,\n\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress\n\ndisorder, and \u201cunspecified neurocognitive\u201d issues.              Dr. Segota\n\n\n                                  - 13 -\n\flisted sadness, rumination, hopelessness, sleep disturbance, and\n\nfatigue    as   \u201cdata   which    support[ed]\u201d    the   diagnoses,    and   she\n\nconcluded that Ovist was unable to work for an unknown period of\n\ntime due to the severity and chronic nature of her symptoms.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, on December 14, 2014, Unum consulted\n\nwith its legal counsel regarding any \u201cconcerns with possibly\n\napplying [the SRS Limitation] to dx [a diagnosis] which may include\n\n. . . fibromyalgia[.]\u201d         Counsel advised Unum that \u201c[t]here is no\n\nbinding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit that would preclude\n\napplication of the [SRS] limitation when fibromyalgia has been\n\ndiagnosed.\u201d\n\n            On December 30, 2014, Nurse Sarah Curran, a medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and agreed with Unum\u2019s\n\nreviewers who determined in \u201c2011 and again in 2013 . . . that\n\nthere was no physical basis to explain the etiology of [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nreported   complaints     of    extreme   fatigue   and   pain[,]    and   [her\n\nrestrictions     and    limitations]      were   supported   based    on   the\n\nconsistency of [her] complaints.\u201d            Nurse Curran also noted that\n\nOvist\u2019s physical exams \u201cremain unremarkable and there has been no\n\ndiagnostic testing performed to explain the etiology of [Ovist\u2019s]\n\ncomplaints.\u201d     Nurse Curran concluded that Ovist was unable to work\n\ndue to her pain and fatigue.       She added that, based on Dr. Segota\u2019s\n\nreport, Ovist was also functionally impaired \u201cfrom a [behavioral\n\nhealth] perspective\u201d beginning in July 2012.\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\f            A   couple   weeks      later,    Dr.    Bryan   Hauser,    a   medical\n\nconsultant for Unum, reviewed Ovist\u2019s file and consulted Dr.\n\nHoffman.    Based on that review, he agreed that Ovist was unable to\n\nwork due to the same \u201cnon-verifiable medical conditions.\u201d\n\n            In a letter dated February 17, 2015, Unum notified Ovist\n\nthat,   after     reviewing    updated       information     in   her   file,   its\n\ndetermination from 2011 remained in place\u2014Ovist was unable to work\n\ndue to CFS and fibromyalgia, and the SRS limitation applied to her\n\nclaim. Unum explained that Ovist\u2019s diagnoses \u201care considered self-\n\nreported,\u201d as they \u201ccannot be verified or confirmed by physical\n\nexamination findings that are not dependent on [Ovist\u2019s] report\n\nand cannot be verified by diagnostic test findings.\u201d                    Unum also\n\nrepeated its prior finding that Ovist\u2019s \u201cphysical examinations\n\nremain unremarkable,\u201d and \u201c[t]here had been no diagnostic testing\n\nperformed    to   explain     the    etiology       of   [Ovist\u2019s]   complaints.\u201d\n\nFinally, Unum noted that Ovist was functionally impaired from a\n\nbehavioral health perspective since July 2012, but since Ovist\u2019s\n\nmaximum benefit period had already been exhausted in June 2013 due\n\nto her conditions of CFS and fibromyalgia, Unum could \u201cno longer\n\nconsider conditions or symptoms based on either behavioral health\n\nor self-reported symptoms.\u201d            Ovist\u2019s final benefit payment was\n\nscheduled for the following day, February 18, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fE. Fourth Review of Disability Claim\n\n              Dr. Klimas responded to Ovist\u2019s 2014 request for updates\n\nin a letter dated February 24, 2015; this letter initiated a fourth\n\nround of review of Ovist\u2019s claim.                 In her letter, Dr. Klimas\n\nasserted that Ovist was unable to work, and her symptoms included\n\nfatigue,      pain,    cognitive     dysfunction,    sleep    disturbance,    and\n\nheadaches.      Dr. Klimas listed diagnoses of CFS, Immune Deficiency\n\nSyndrome, Myalgia, Orthostatic hypotension, and sleep disturbance,\n\nand she noted that water and mold damage in Ovist\u2019s home \u201cprobably\n\ncontributed to the worsening of her health.\u201d                 She added that her\n\nfindings were \u201cconfirmed by physical examination, medical history,\n\nand       laboratory    data     .    .   .     show[ing]     impaired   immune\n\nfunction . . . and latent virus reactivations.\u201d\n\n              According to the claim log, Unum tried to contact Dr.\n\nKlimas multiple times in March 2015 \u201cto clarify the etiologies of\n\n[Ovist\u2019s] impairing symptoms and the basis for the diagnosis of\n\n[the] conditions\u201d Klimas listed.                Dr. Klimas\u2019s response, dated\n\nJune 12, 2015, was considered by Unum\u2019s Appeals Committee.6\n\n              On April 14, 2015, Dr. Hauser reviewed Ovist\u2019s file\n\nagain.      He disagreed with Dr. Klimas\u2019s \u201cassertion that [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nimpairing      symptoms    are     attributable     to   (either   directly   or\n\n\n      6Unum added Dr. Klimas\u2019s June 2015 statement to Ovist\u2019s claim\nfile on July 17, 2015. The content and opinions that Dr. Klimas\u2019s\nexpressed in her June 2015 statement were similar to those\nexpressed in her February 2015 letter to Unum.\n\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\findirectly)   viral   infection,    immune    deficiency,    or    any   other\n\nverifiable (through physical examination or diagnostic testing)\n\nmedical condition.\u201d      He also noted that Dr. Klimas\u2019s tests for\n\nviral infection only provided \u201cevidence of past (and not acute or\n\nongoing)\u201d infection.       Overall, Dr. Hauser         came to a similar\n\nconclusion regarding Ovist\u2019s claim as he did the previous year\u2014\n\nthat Ovist was unable to work due to fatigue, pain, and depression,\n\nand   these   symptoms    were    attributed      to   diagnoses    of   CFS,\n\nfibromyalgia, and depression, which were not objectively verified.\n\nWith respect to fibromyalgia, Dr. Hauser stated that Ovist\u2019s\n\ndiagnosis     \u201cis     supported     by      the    history    of     chronic\n\ngeneralized . . . pain and the finding of at least 11 [of] 18\n\nfibromyalgia tender points.\u201d         He elaborated on the subjective\n\nnature of the tender point examination, noting that, during the\n\nexamination, \u201cpain elicited by the application of pressure by the\n\nexaminer (i.e., tenderness) is experienced and reported by the\n\nexaminee; its existence cannot be verified.\u201d\n\n            A couple days later, Unum medical consultant Dr. James\n\nBress completed an independent analysis of Ovist\u2019s file. Dr. Bress\n\nagreed that Ovist was unable to work, and he identified that Dr.\n\nKlimas was the only treatment provider to state that Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional loss was \u201c[due to] verifiable medical problems,\u201d namely\n\nimmune impairment and latent virus reactivations. Like Dr. Hauser,\n\nDr. Bress disagreed with this aspect of Dr. Klimas\u2019s opinion.               He\n\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fdetermined that Dr. Klimas\u2019s finding was not supported by any\n\nevidence, and that the tests Dr. Klimas administered to assess\n\nimmune function and viruses were not \u201cstandard medical testing\u201d\n\nand/or had no confirmed association with Ovist\u2019s symptoms.\n\n              Unum sent Ovist a letter dated April 17, 2015, stating\n\nthat it maintained its decision to terminate her benefits under\n\nthe SRS limitation as of February 18, 2015.           Unum explained that\n\nOvist   was    functionally   impaired   based   on   the   non-verifiable\n\nconditions of CFS, fibromyalgia, and depression.            Unum added that\n\nthe diagnoses were \u201csupported in part\u201d by Ovist\u2019s repeated reports\n\nof pain and fatigue, as well as \u201cthe finding of at least 11/18\n\nfibromyalgia tender points.\u201d\n\n              On June 15, 2015, Ovist sent Unum a fungal report and a\n\nNovember 2013 mold analysis of her home.         Dr. Hauser and Dr. Bress\n\neach reviewed the documentation and concluded that it did not\n\nchange their prior conclusions, as there is no proven association\n\nbetween mold contamination or elevated fungal spores and Ovist\u2019s\n\nsymptoms or diagnoses.         Accordingly, on July 14, 2015, Unum\n\ninformed Ovist that its benefits determination and supporting\n\nrationale remained the same.\n\nF. Ovist\u2019s Administrative Appeal\n\n              Ovist appealed Unum\u2019s decision in a letter dated July 4,\n\n2015.   Unum defined the \u201cmedical question\u201d on appeal as whether\n\n\u201cthe records support functional loss and/or [restrictions and\n\n\n                                 - 18 -\n\flimitations] due to physical medical condition/symptoms that are\n\nverifiable using tests, procedures or clinical examinations as of\n\n[February 17, 2015]         forward[.]\u201d\n\n            Ovist submitted additional information for review on\n\nappeal\u2014office notes from a gastrointestinal specialist from May\n\n2013; office notes from Dr. Hoffman from January to July 2015;\n\nrecords and diagnostic test results from primary care physician\n\nDr. Dube and cardiologist Dr. Potts from January and February 2015;\n\nand records and lab reports from Dr. Klimas from February and March\n\n2015.       Ovist    also     provided       Unum    with     the    results       of   a\n\nCardiopulmonary       Exercise      Test    (\u201cCPET\u201d)       conducted    by   exercise\n\nphysiologist Jeffrey Cournoyer on September 24-25, 2015.                      The CPET\n\nis designed \u201cto determine functional capacity and assess the\n\nrecovery response to a standardized physical stressor.\u201d7\n\n            In    his     report,    Cournoyer       explained      that     the    CPET\n\nconsisted    of     two   identical    tests        that    were    administered        on\n\nconsecutive days, in order to \u201cestablish changes in work function\n\ncapacity.\u201d        Cournoyer    noted       that   Ovist     \u201cdemonstrated      maximal\n\n\n\n\n     7 According to Massachusetts General Hospital, \u201c[t]he primary\npurpose of . . .

He\n\nalso found that Ovist\u2019s metabolic responses indicated \u201ca higher\n\nprobability of running out of energy\u201d on the second day; her\n\n\u201c[b]reathing values showed more strain\u201d on the second day; and her\n\n\u201cwattage at maximal effort\u201d on both days was \u201cpathologically low.\u201d\n\nSeemingly consistent with this, Cournoyer observed that Ovist left\n\nthe office fatigued on the first day of testing, but after the\n\nsecond day of testing, Ovist\u2019s \u201cposture and walking gait suggested\n\na severely weakened state, and [Cournoyer] was not comfortable\n\nwith allowing her to leave in that condition.\u201d        The CPET also\n\nincluded an element of cognitive testing.     Cournoyer found that\n\nOvist \u201cshowed the most drastic changes\u201d across the two days in her\n\n\u201cimmediate and delayed recall of simple information\u201d and in her\n\nconcentration.\n\n          Unum\u2019s Angela Malan-Elzawahry reviewed Ovist\u2019s file on\n\nJanuary 5, 2016.   Malan-Elzawahry detailed the medical conditions\n\nwith which Ovist had been diagnosed or for which she had been\n\nevaluated and/or treated, including infections, sinusitis, CFS,\n\nfibromyalgia, wrist pain, ankle sprain, shingles, thyroid goiter,\n\nchronic   pain     syndrome,   opioid   dependence,     depression,\n\n\n                               - 20 -\n\fcardiopulmonary     conditions,      left   knee    pain        and    related     joint\n\nissues, and mold exposure.              She also described the results of\n\nvarious laboratory or diagnostic tests administered to Ovist,\n\nwhich she found to be unremarkable.           According to Malan-Elzawahry,\n\ntests for viral illnesses, which were repeatedly administered to\n\nOvist beginning in 2006, had not provided evidence of current\n\ninfection; a 2012 sleep study did not \u201cidentify sleep apnea at a\n\nseverity to be expected to cause the level of fatigue that [Ovist]\n\nhas   reported\u201d;    and   a   2015      cardiac    evaluation          did   not   show\n\n\u201crestrictions and limitations . . . related to a cardiopulmonary\n\ncondition[.]\u201d\n\n             Malan-Elzawahry      concluded        that     Ovist       consistently\n\nreported     worsening    pain    and     fatigue,        but     the    \u201cconditions\n\nidentified by testing, such as thyroid goiter, a joint effusion,\n\nand anterior cardiac wall soft tissue attenuation [were] not\n\ncorrelating with symptoms that are at a severity to limit [Ovist\u2019s]\n\nfunction,\u201d nor were they \u201cexpected to generate the fatigue and\n\ngeneralized pain symptoms reported by [Ovist].\u201d                       Malan-Elzawahry\n\ndeferred to Unum\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Scott Norris, for\n\nfurther, independent analysis of the appeal.\n\n             On January 21, 2016, Dr. Norris concluded that Ovist\u2019s\n\nfunctional     limitations       were     \u201cbased    on      [Ovist\u2019s]        reported\n\n[symptoms]    and   [were]     not   consistent      with        the    minimal     and\n\nnonspecific findings documented on examinations or the diagnostic\n\n\n                                     - 21 -\n\ftesting/imaging    studies       included     in     the   file   records.\u201d        He\n\nelaborated on this conclusion, noting, for example, that \u201cmultiple\n\nlaboratory     tests     were    negative      for     infections,       metabolic,\n\nimmunologic, hematologic, inflammatory, or other verifiable causes\n\nof   [Ovist\u2019s]   reported       fatigue\u201d;    Ovist\u2019s       \u201c[r]ecords    [did]    not\n\ncatalogue    examinations       or   testing       consistent     with    cognitive\n\nimpairment related to physical conditions\u201d; Ovist\u2019s February 2015\n\ncardiac tests were normal; and \u201calthough [Ovist] reported mold\n\nexposure in her home, the records do not reveal evidence of\n\nimpairment related to mold.\u201d\n\n            Finally, Dr. Norris expressed reservations about Ovist\u2019s\n\nCPET results. He wrote that the September 2015 CPET was not \u201ctime-\n\nrelevant regarding [Ovist\u2019s] functional capacity as of February\n\n2015,\u201d the date when Unum closed Ovist\u2019s claim.                 He also indicated\n\nthat Ovist did not \u201cexhibit maximal effort\u201d at certain points of\n\nthe CPET, meaning that \u201ca true . . . maximal aerobic capacity[]\n\nwas not measured.\u201d\n\n            Unum denied Ovist\u2019s appeal in a letter dated January 27,\n\n2016, concluding that the SRS limitation applied to Ovist\u2019s claim.\n\nIn the letter, Unum repeated Dr. Norris\u2019s conclusion that her\n\nreported     impairing    symptoms     and     her     functional        loss    were\n\n\u201cinconsistent with and/or not supported\u201d by clinical examinations,\n\ndiagnostic findings, or other objectively verifiable evidence in\n\nher file.    Unum listed examples: there was no \u201ccorrelation between\n\n\n                                     - 22 -\n\f. . .

Procedural History\n\n          On August 2, 2017, following the adverse determination\n\non her administrative appeal, Ovist initiated an ERISA action in\n\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging\n\nthat Unum unlawfully terminated her benefits.   On August 30, 2019,\n\nthe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. A magistrate\n\njudge issued a Report and Recommendation on February 24, 2020,\n\nrecommending that the district court grant Unum\u2019s motion and deny\n\nOvist\u2019s motion.\n\n          In the Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge\n\nfirst determined that Ovist, as the claimant, bears the burden to\n\nprove that the SRS limitation does not apply to her claim.   Then,\n\nhe found that Unum acted reasonably, under the terms of the Plan\n\nand this circuit\u2019s precedent, when it terminated Ovist\u2019s benefits\n\nunder the SRS limitation based on a finding that Ovist\u2019s impairing\n\nsymptoms, such as pain and fatigue, were based on her self-\n\nreporting, as opposed to objectively verifiable diagnostic or\n\nother tests.   The magistrate judge relied, in particular, on case\n\nlaw from this court establishing that it is unreasonable for an\n\ninsurer to require a claimant to provide objective evidence of\n\ndiagnoses that do not lend themselves to objective verification,\n\n\n\n\n                              - 24 -\n\fbut an insurer can reasonably require objective evidence of a\n\nclaimant\u2019s resulting functional limitations.\n\n           In March 2020, Ovist filed an objection to the Report\n\nand Recommendation, and Unum filed a reply.     The district court\n\nadopted the Report and Recommendation in full on March 27, 2020.\n\nThis timely appeal followed. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.\n\nII.

Analysis\n\n            Unum approved Ovist\u2019s long-term disability claim in 2011\n\ndue to her symptoms related to CFS.

She argues that it\n\nwas unreasonable for Unum to require objective evidence of her\n\nfunctional loss after concluding that she was unable to work.     In\n\nthe alternative, she claims that she did provide the requested\n\nevidence\u2014her CPET results\u2014and Unum rejected the results \u201con the\n\nflimsiest of grounds.\u201d      Next, Ovist contends that the Seventh\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of a provision almost\n\nidentical to the SRS limitation, in Weitzenkamp, should control,\n\n\n\n\n                               - 27 -\n\fand the SRS limitation does not apply to her claim under the\n\nholding in Weitzenkamp.

For example, in February and April 2015 letters\nnotifying Ovist that her benefits would be terminated under the\nSRS limitation, Unum stated that her functional limitations were\nassociated with fibromyalgia and CFS, two conditions that \u201cwere\nconsidered self-reported\u201d since they could not be confirmed by\n\u201cclinical signs\u201d or \u201cdiagnostic test findings.\u201d Relatedly, when\nUnum sought guidance from legal counsel on Ovist\u2019s claim, its\nquestion turned on Ovist\u2019s diagnosis, as opposed to her functional\nlimitations. Specifically, Unum asked counsel if it was legally\npermissible to apply the SRS limitation to a diagnosis of\nfibromyalgia. While these examples show an inconsistency in Unum\u2019s\nhandling of Ovist\u2019s claim, they are peripheral to our analysis on\nappeal.

In 2013, Dr. Smith concluded that Ovist was\n\nunable to work based on her consistent complaints of pain and\n\nfatigue,     her   treatment    history,   Dr.   Hoffman\u2019s   report     of    her\n\nnarcotic dependence, observations from Unum\u2019s field visit, and her\n\n2012 SSDI award.      Dr. Smith did not base his conclusion, then, on\n\nany clinical exams, diagnostic findings, or objectively verifiable\n\nphysical exams evidencing Ovist\u2019s functional limitations.

Malan-Elzawahry found that\n\nOvist\u2019s 2012 sleep study and 2015 cardiac tests did not identify\n\nconditions      or     symptoms     that      could    explain    Ovist\u2019s   functional\n\nlimitations.         Dr. Norris determined that Ovist\u2019s laboratory tests\n\nwere        negative      for       \u201cinfections,         metabolic,      hematologic,\n\ninflammatory, or other verifiable causes\u201d of Ovist\u2019s fatigue.                           He\n\nalso noted that Ovist\u2019s cardiac tests were normal, and no tests or\n\nexaminations         in   Ovist\u2019s      file    were    consistent    with   \u201ccognitive\n\nimpairment related to physical conditions.\u201d                       Finally, Dr. Bress,\n\nMalan-Elzawahry, and Dr. Norris reviewed Ovist\u2019s fungal report and\n\n\n        Consistent with this finding, when reviewing Ovist\u2019s\n       12\n\nadministrative appeal, Unum\u2019s Malan-Elzawahry also found that\nOvist\u2019s tests for viral illnesses, dating back to 2006, did not\nprovide evidence of current infections.\n\n\n                                           - 35 -\n\fthe mold analysis of her home and agreed that there was no known\n\nassociation between mold or fungus exposure and Ovist\u2019s disabling\n\nsymptoms.\n\n            Ovist does not dispute Unum\u2019s assessment of the evidence\n\nabove.    Rather, Ovist points to her September 2015 CPET results as\n\nthe   singular    source    of    objective      proof    of    her   functional\n\nlimitations, and she argues that Unum rejected the CPET results on\n\n\u201cthe flimsiest of grounds.\u201d        We disagree.\n\n            Unum\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Norris, reviewed the CPET\n\nresults and concluded that the test was not time-relevant and did\n\nnot reflect Ovist\u2019s maximal effort.              Dr. Norris\u2019s assessment of\n\nOvist\u2019s   maximal      effort   was,    at   least   in   part,    supported   by\n\nCournoyer\u2019s own statement that Ovist \u201cdemonstrated maximal effort\n\nin some, but not all of the testing measures.\u201d                 On the other side\n\nof the ledger, Cournoyer opined that the tests on both days were\n\n\u201cof maximal nature.\u201d       His report lists respiratory, metabolic, and\n\nother markers showing that Ovist experienced fatigue and cognitive\n\nimpairment following physical activity on both days.                   And Ovist\n\nargues    that   the    seven-month      gap    between   the     February   2015\n\ntermination of her claim and the administration of the CPET is not\n\nmeaningful because there is no evidence that her symptoms changed\n\nduring that period.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\f           When considering the CPET,13 Unum credited Dr. Norris\u2019s\n\nopinion over Cournoyer\u2019s findings.

In Weitzenkamp, the court interpreted an SRS limitation\n\nalmost identical to the one at bar.        Under the SRS limitation in\n\nWeitzenkamp, benefits ceased after 24 months for individuals with\n\n\u201cdisabilities, due to sickness or injury, which are primarily based\n\non self-reported symptoms, and disabilities due to mental illness,\n\nalcoholism or drug abuse.\u201d       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613895\"><a href=\"/opinion/613895/weitzenkamp-v-unum-life-ins-co-of-america/\">661 F.3d at 326-27</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Since the\nSRS limitation, by its terms, applies to \u201cany combination\u201d of\n\u201cdisabilities due to mental illness and disabilities based\nprimarily on self-reported symptoms,\u201d Unum can reasonably apply\nthe limitation when only one of the categories of disabilities is\npresent. Since we already determined that Unum reasonably applied\nthe limitation after completing more than 24 months of payments\nfor the second category of \u201cdisabilities based primarily on self-\nreported symptoms,\u201d we need not consider whether it was also\nreasonable to apply the limitation under the first category of\ndisabilities \u201cdue to mental illness.\u201d\n\n\n                                 - 38 -\n\f           The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the\n\nSRS limitation \u201capplies to disabling illnesses or injuries that\n\nare diagnosed primarily based on self-reported symptoms rather\n\nthan to all illnesses or injuries for which disabling symptoms are\n\nself-reported.\u201d     </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613895\"><a href=\"/opinion/613895/weitzenkamp-v-unum-life-ins-co-of-america/\">Id. at 330</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis in original).

Accordingly,\n\neven if we accept that Ovist tested positive for fibromyalgia based\n\non tender points, we still conclude that it was reasonable for\n\nUnum to require that Ovist provide objective evidence of her\n\nfunctional limitations, and to apply the SRS limitation based on\n\nthe relative absence of this evidence.\n\n          We also find Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement to be\n\nreasonable (contrary to the conclusion in Weitzenkamp) for at least\n\ntwo reasons.   First, it merely calls for the claimant to establish\n\na causal connection between his or her disability and his or her\n\nalleged functional limitation(s) before being awarded long-term\n\ndisability benefits beyond 24 months.    Far from being arbitrary or\n\ncapricious, this type of inquiry into causation is often necessary\n\nfor a claim administrator to ensure that benefits are paid as\n\nintended by the operative policy.   See, e.g., Arruda, 951 F.3d at\n\n21-22 (finding that the claimant was not eligible for death\n\nbenefits under an insurance policy issued for accidental death or\n\ninjury, since substantial evidence in the record supported the\n\nconclusion that the death was caused or contributed to by the\n\ndecedent\u2019s pre-existing health conditions).      In this case, the\n\ncausal connection must be established to confirm that Ovist is\n\nunable to work due to her recognized, diagnosed medical conditions,\n\nas opposed to her unverifiable perceptions.\n\n\n                               - 40 -\n\f             Unum\u2019s objective evidence requirement is also reasonable\n\nbecause it furthers the purpose of the SRS limitation, as defined\n\nby   Unum.         Under   the    terms    of    the   Plan,     Unum   \u201cha[s]   the\n\ndiscretionary authority to construe the [P]lan\u201d; thus, Unum also\n\n\u201cha[s] the discretion to determine the intended meaning of the\n\n[P]lan\u2019s terms.\u201d           Stamp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203356\"><a href=\"/opinion/203356/stamp-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\">531 F.3d at 93-94</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal quotation\n\nomitted). And according to Unum, the purpose of the SRS limitation\n\nis \u201cto address conditions\u201d that manifest themselves in a manner\n\nthat renders the           resulting functional limitations \u201cinherently\n\ndifficult to determine.\u201d             It should not be deemed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, then, for Unum to further this goal by requiring\n\nobjective evidence of Ovist\u2019s functional limitations, as such\n\nevidence is a more reliable indicator of the severity of Ovist\u2019s\n\nlimitations than her self-reporting of pain and fatigue.                     Unum\u2019s\n\nrequirement is particularly reasonable here, where Ovist had the\n\nopportunity to take the CPET, a test that can provide objective\n\nevidence of her functional limitations, but she failed to do so in\n\na timely manner.           Ultimately, we do not adopt Weitzenkamp, and\n\ninstead adhere to this circuit\u2019s law and conclude that Unum\u2019s\n\ninterpretation        of    the   SRS     limitation      is   not   arbitrary    or\n\ncapricious.\n\nIV.

Factual Background\n\n       Newman was charged with third-degree sexual abuse following an incident\n\nin which he solicited a thirteen-year-old female to an abandoned apartment, where\n\nhe forced her to engage in sexual intercourse. A plea agreement was reached, in\n\nwhich Newman agreed to plead guilty to lascivious acts with a child\u2013solicitation, a\n\nclass \u201cD\u201d felony. See Iowa Code \u00a7 709.8(1)(d) (2017).\n\n       At the plea hearing, the district court engaged Newman in a colloquy to\n\nestablish that his guilty plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by a factual\n\nbasis. The court inquired into Newman\u2019s mental competency through several\n\nquestions, to which Newman answered that he was not \u201cunder the influence of an\n\nalcoholic beverage, drug, or medication\u201d; he was not \u201cseeing a doctor, psychiatrist,\n\nor psychologist\u201d; and he had not \u201cbeen hospitalized in the last six months.\u201d\n\nNewman agreed he was pleading guilty \u201cvoluntarily and of [my] own free will,\u201d\n\n\u201cbecause . . . it\u2019s about the best option\u2014the best way to go.\u201d He further stated he\n\nunderstood his rights and the consequences of pleading guilty, and the court\n\naccepted his plea.\n\n       Newman waived his right to file a motion in arrest of judgment to challenge\n\nhis plea. Meanwhile, the State prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI).\n\f                                         3\n\n\nThe PSI indicated Newman \u201c[h]as been diagnosed with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder,\n\nand Schizophrenia\u201d and was \u201ctaking medication to address these issues while in\n\nthe Polk County Jail.\u201d The PSI further noted Newman \u201cwas involved in special\n\neducation programming while in school\u201d and was \u201cinterested in obtaining his GED\n\nin the future.\u201d\n\n       Newman later appeared for sentencing with counsel. At the outset of the\n\nhearing, defense counsel addressed the court regarding \u201csomething that appeared\n\nin the [PSI].\u201d The following colloquy then took place:\n\n                DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, I just wanted to make a little\n       record about references in this report to special education and\n       mental health diagnoses by Mr. Newman of schizophrenia and\n       bipolar. Those were things that I was not aware of at the time of his\n       plea, but, nonetheless, I exercised a reasonable professional\n       judgment.\n                The reason that those were concerning to me when I saw\n       them in the report was two things that I would want to speak with him\n       about would be whether to request a competency evaluation or\n       whether to possibly advance a defense of diminished responsibility\n       at trial. I think that I exercised reasonable professional judgment in\n       dealing with those issues, because except with respect to the\n       competency evaluation, although I didn\u2019t know that Mr. Newman had\n       received special education services, I was very aware that he\n       limited\u2014that he was obviously, the product of a poor school. And in\n       talking with him about his case, I looked very closely at how he would\n       process information and make decisions.\n                We talked about, in this case, obviously, he has a lot of bad\n       options. We talked about some of the things that were very\n       complicated. We talked about the registry and special sentences\n       and how that information would affect him, potentially, for his whole\n       life if he was convicted as charged. During those conversations,\n       which were really complex, Mr. Newman was able to appropriately\n       process the information, weigh it, and make what I thought was the\n       best decision. So that raised absolutely no concerns for me\n       whatsoever about his competency.\n                And a second piece of information that was relevant to me in\n       exercising professional judgment on those grounds was when we got\n       the DNA test results back I was able to discuss that with Mr.\n       Newman, and I felt like he was really able to appreciate how having\n\f                                        4\n\n\n      those results changed the strength of the State\u2019s case, making trial\n      a much worse option for him to pursue.\n             Those are just a few of the examples of why I would not have\n      moved for a competency evaluation in this case. And for the same\n      reasons, I would say that I wouldn\u2019t have advanced, and I don\u2019t think\n      Mr. Newman would have wanted me to advance, a diminished\n      responsibility defense at trial.\n             We made our decision to plead guilty recognizing that it was\n      the best option for Mr. Newman amongst a whole bunch of really bad\n      options. And I don\u2019t think anything about that information that I\u2014that\n      I learned from the PSI would change that or would change Mr.\n      Newman\u2019s desire to continue with this guilty plea. Thank you.\n             COURT: All right.\n             Mr. Newman, you heard the statement of [defense counsel].\n      Do you understand what he was talking about?\n             NEWMAN: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor.\n             COURT: Do you have any comments or do you have any\n      disagreement with anything that he said?\n             NEWMAN: No.\n             COURT: Okay. I need an answer out loud.\n             NEWMAN: No.\n             COURT: Okay. We had a lengthy discussion during the plea\n      hearing, and it appeared to me during that hearing that you were\n      processing everything well and understood everything well during\n      the hearing; is that correct?\n             NEWMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n      The district court proceeded and imposed Newman\u2019s sentence. Newman\n\nappealed.\n\nII.   Good Cause to Appeal\n\n      Preliminarily, the State argues that the court \u201cshould dismiss the appeal\u201d\n\nbecause \u201cNewman has no right of appeal from his guilty plea\u201d under Iowa Code\n\nsection 814.6 (Supp. 2019), his conviction was not for a class \u201cA\u201d felony, and he\n\n\u201chas not alleged or established \u2018good cause\u2019 as to why the appeal should be\n\npermitted to proceed.\u201d1 Iowa Code section 814.6(1)(a)(3) provides: \u201cRight of\n\n\n1 Because the district court entered Newman\u2019s judgment of conviction and\nsentence after July 1, 2019, the statutory amendment to section 814.6 restricting\nappeals from guilty pleas is applicable to his appeal.\n\f                                         5\n\n\nappeal is granted the defendant from [a] final judgment of sentence, except . . . [a]\n\nconviction where the defendant has pled guilty,\u201d unless \u201cthe defendant establishes\n\ngood cause.\u201d \u201cGood cause\u201d means a \u201clegally sufficient reason.\u201d State v. Tucker,\n\n959 N.W.2d 140, 153 (Iowa 2021) (quoting State v. Damme, 944 N.W.2d 98, 104\n\n(Iowa 2020)). \u201cA legally sufficient reason to appeal as a matter of right is a reason\n\nthat, at a minimum, would allow a court to provide some relief on direct appeal.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n       Newman has not addressed the good-cause issue with respect to his claim\n\nof incompetence at the time of his guilty plea. But \u201c[t]his court has addressed the\n\nissue and concluded \u2018that good cause exists to challenge competency at the time\n\nof the plea irrespective of whether the issue was contested below.\u2019\u201d State v.\n\nChindlund, No. 20-1368, 2021 WL 2708944, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. June 30, 2021)\n\n(quoting State v. Cue, No. 19-2150, 2020 WL 6157813, at *3 (Iowa Ct. App. Oct.\n\n21, 2020)). Accordingly, we find Newman has good cause to proceed with this\n\nappeal.2\n\nIII.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       Newman first contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\n\nthat he be \u201cexamined for competency\u201d or use his \u201cmental health state to assert a\n\ndiminished capacity defense.\u201d The State again responds that recent statutory\n\namendments preclude consideration of this claim. See Iowa Code \u00a7 814.7 (stating\n\nan ineffective-assistance-of-counsel \u201cclaim shall not be decided on direct appeal\n\n\n2 The State filed a motion to dismiss premised upon the same grounds\u2014that\nNewman failed to show good cause\u2014and the motion was ordered to be submitted\nwith this appeal. For the reasons provided, we find it unnecessary to further\naddress the motion.\n\f                                          6\n\n\nfrom the criminal proceedings\u201d).       On this point, we agree with the State.\n\nAccordingly, we do not address the merits of Newman\u2019s claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in this direct appeal.\n\nIV.    Competency\n\n       Newman\u2019s second issue is directed to whether the district court erred in\n\nfailing to order a competency hearing.3 According to Newman, \u201cBased on the\n\ninformation in the transcript[] of the plea, sentencing and the PSI Report,[4] there is\n\na basis for determining that [he] may not have been competent to stand trial and\n\nshould have been given a competency hearing and subsequent examination.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Newman contends the court failed to make further inquiry into his\n\ncompetency after it \u201chad access to [the] PSI report which stated that [he] suffered\n\nfrom bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia and had special education in school.\u201d\n\n       \u201cUnder the United States Constitution, the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas declared that the conviction of an incompetent defendant violates due\n\nprocess.\u201d State v. Einfeldt, 914 N.W.2d 773, 778 (Iowa 2018). \u201cWe review whether\n\na trial court should have ordered a competency hearing de novo.\u201d Id.\n\n       Iowa Code section 812.3(1) provides:\n\n              If at any stage of a criminal proceeding the defendant or the\n       defendant\u2019s attorney, upon application to the court, alleges specific\n       facts showing that the defendant is suffering from a mental disorder\n       which prevents the defendant from appreciating the charge,\n       understanding the proceedings, or assisting effectively in the\n\n3 The State does not contend Newman\u2019s appeal of this issue is foreclosed by the\namendments to Iowa Code sections 814.6 and 814.7.                  The State also\nacknowledges that a claim the district court failed to order a competency hearing\nsua sponte is not subject to traditional rules of error preservation. See State v.\nLucas, 323 N.W.2d 228, 230 (Iowa 1982).\n4 Newman acknowledges no evidence existed in this record to order a competency\n\nhearing until the PSI was prepared for the sentencing hearing.\n\f                                          7\n\n\n       defense, the court shall suspend further proceedings and determine\n       if probable cause exists to sustain the allegations. The applicant has\n       the burden of establishing probable cause. The court may on its own\n       motion schedule a hearing to determine probable cause if the\n       defendant or defendant\u2019s attorney has failed or refused to make an\n       application under this section and the court finds that there are\n       specific facts showing that a hearing should be held on that question.\n\n(Emphasis added.) There is a presumption that a defendant is competent to stand\n\ntrial, and the defendant has the burden to prove incompetence. See State v.\n\nGaston, No. 18-1293, 2020 WL 1307690, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2020). The\n\nquestion here is whether there were \u201cspecific facts\u201d regarding Newman\u2019s\n\ncompetency that required the court to order a competency hearing sua sponte.\n\nSee Iowa Code \u00a7 812.3(1).\n\n       In Einfeldt, the court reversed the defendant\u2019s judgment and remanded for\n\na new trial upon concluding the factors before the district court (i.e., the defendant\n\ninformed defense counsel that she \u201csuffered from mental health issues in the past\u201d\n\nand defense counsel informed the court \u201cregarding the difficulty of representation\u201d;\n\nthe defendant testified she \u201cwant[ed] to kill her lawyer and stab her lawyer in the\n\nneck with a pen\u201d and that she believed \u201csomeone was \u2018poisoning the water\u2019\u201d; the\n\ndefendant did not understand the charges against her and \u201cdid not remember the\n\nevents of the previous day\u201d; the defendant told the court \u201cshe had been diagnosed\n\nwith paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and\n\nattention deficit disorder\u201d and \u201cshe had prescriptions for these disorders but had\n\nnot been taking her medication for a couple of months because she did not have\n\nthe money\u201d; and the PSI corroborated the defendant\u2019s statements and\n\n\u201crecommended an assessment by a licensed professional\u201d) should have led a\n\f                                         8\n\n\nreasonable trial judge to experience doubt on whether the defendant was\n\ncompetent to stand trial. 914 N.W.2d at 777\u201378, 781\u201383.\n\n       Newman seeks the same resolution here. However, after consideration of\n\nthe appropriate factors, we conclude there is insufficient evidence to meet even\n\nthe \u201clow threshold\u201d noted in Einfeldt, and we decline to determine the district court\n\ncommitted legal error in failing to order a competency hearing pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode section 812.3 on the record before us. Cf. id. at 782. Although the PSI\n\nprovided information regarding Newman\u2019s past diagnoses of several mental-health\n\nissues, we note that the PSI also stated Newman was taking his medication while\n\nin custody. We are not privy to know whether medications were taken, as Newman\n\nstated during the guilty plea proceeding that he was not on any medication. We\n\nacknowledge the district court may have been well advised to inquire at the\n\nsentencing hearing concerning Newman\u2019s use of any medications.\n\n       Notwithstanding, we find it significant that defense counsel informed the\n\ncourt that he had no concern about Newman\u2019s mental health based on their\n\ninteractions. Newman concedes, \u201cThe Trial Court is to give great weight based on\n\nthe statements of trail [sic] counsel regarding their client\u2019s competency.\u201d Here,\n\ndefense counsel spoke at length at sentencing and noted no difficulties in\n\ncommunications with Newman. Defense counsel also noted a lack of any irrational\n\ncomments or behavior by Newman during the guilty plea proceeding and other\n\nattorney-client discussions, and the fact that Newman appeared to understand and\n\nproperly respond to the court\u2019s colloquy and other statements. Cf. id. at 780\u201381\n\n(noting \u201c[c]ompetency evaluations include a \u2018careful assessment of the accused\u2019s\n\nability to interact with counsel\u2019\u201d and a \u201cprofessional statement\u201d by defense counsel\n\f                                         9\n\n\nregarding representation \u201cplays an important role\u201d (citation omitted)). We also note\n\nthat \u201c[a] history of mental illness standing alone . . . does not mean the defendant\n\nis incompetent.\u201d State v. Edwards, 507 N.W.2d 393, 395 (Iowa 1993).\n\n       It may have helped our resolution if the district court had inquired\n\nconcerning Newman\u2019s mental-health issues and medication, but without any\n\nunusual conduct, improper responses, or apprehension by defense counsel we\n\nconclude these facts and circumstances are insufficient to order a competency\n\nevaluation under Iowa Code 812.3. See, e.g., Chindlund, 2021 WL 2708944, at\n\n*3 (\u201c[O]n the record presented, Chindlund has failed to meet his burden to prove\n\nhe was incompetent when his guilty plea was accepted.\u201d); Cue, 2020 WL 6157813,\n\nat *4 (\u201cIn sum, Cue failed to show any behavior suggesting he was incompetent to\n\nplead guilty.\u201d). We reach these conclusions notwithstanding the fact that \u201cany one\n\nfactor alone may sufficiently raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable\n\ntrial judge.\u201d Einfeldt, 914 N.W.2d at 781. And we acknowledge a more adequate\n\nrecord may be developed in postconviction-relief proceedings. See Chindlund,\n\n2021 WL 2708944, at *3 (\u201c[Chindlund\u2019s] claim is better suited for postconviction\n\nrelief where an adequate record may be developed.\u201d).\n\n       We affirm Newman\u2019s conviction.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f", "node": {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/4924284/", "id": 4924284, "absolute_url": "/opinion/5105904/state-of-iowa-v-dantreon-levon-newman/", "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/5105904/", "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2021-09-22T09:07:25.478219-07:00", "date_modified": "2021-09-22T09:40:18.621230-07:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "c306cfcad342f1650a50d890e047842815b543cf", "page_count": 9, "download_url": "https://www.iowacourts.gov/courtcases/13696/embed/CourtAppealsOpinion", "local_path": "pdf/2021/09/22/state_of_iowa_v._dantreon_levon_newman.pdf", "plain_text": "                    IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF IOWA\n\n                                  No. 19-1228\n                           Filed September 22, 2021\n\n\nSTATE OF IOWA,\n     Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nDANTREON LEVON NEWMAN,\n     Defendant-Appellant.\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n      Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Jeffrey Farrell, Judge.\n\n\n\n      Dantreon Newman appeals following his guilty plea to lascivious acts with\n\na child.

He contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to\n\nrequest that he be \u201cexamined for competency\u201d or use his \u201cmental health state to\n\nassert a diminished capacity defense\u201d and the district court \u201cshould have ordered\n\na competency hearing.\u201d Upon our review, we affirm.\n\nI.     Factual Background\n\n       Newman was charged with third-degree sexual abuse following an incident\n\nin which he solicited a thirteen-year-old female to an abandoned apartment, where\n\nhe forced her to engage in sexual intercourse. A plea agreement was reached, in\n\nwhich Newman agreed to plead guilty to lascivious acts with a child\u2013solicitation, a\n\nclass \u201cD\u201d felony. See Iowa Code \u00a7 709.8(1)(d) (2017).\n\n       At the plea hearing, the district court engaged Newman in a colloquy to\n\nestablish that his guilty plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by a factual\n\nbasis. The court inquired into Newman\u2019s mental competency through several\n\nquestions, to which Newman answered that he was not \u201cunder the influence of an\n\nalcoholic beverage, drug, or medication\u201d; he was not \u201cseeing a doctor, psychiatrist,\n\nor psychologist\u201d; and he had not \u201cbeen hospitalized in the last six months.\u201d\n\nNewman agreed he was pleading guilty \u201cvoluntarily and of [my] own free will,\u201d\n\n\u201cbecause . . . it\u2019s about the best option\u2014the best way to go.\u201d He further stated he\n\nunderstood his rights and the consequences of pleading guilty, and the court\n\naccepted his plea.\n\n       Newman waived his right to file a motion in arrest of judgment to challenge\n\nhis plea. Meanwhile, the State prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI).\n\f                                         3\n\n\nThe PSI indicated Newman \u201c[h]as been diagnosed with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder,\n\nand Schizophrenia\u201d and was \u201ctaking medication to address these issues while in\n\nthe Polk County Jail.\u201d The PSI further noted Newman \u201cwas involved in special\n\neducation programming while in school\u201d and was \u201cinterested in obtaining his GED\n\nin the future.\u201d\n\n       Newman later appeared for sentencing with counsel. At the outset of the\n\nhearing, defense counsel addressed the court regarding \u201csomething that appeared\n\nin the [PSI].\u201d The following colloquy then took place:\n\n                DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, I just wanted to make a little\n       record about references in this report to special education and\n       mental health diagnoses by Mr. Newman of schizophrenia and\n       bipolar. Those were things that I was not aware of at the time of his\n       plea, but, nonetheless, I exercised a reasonable professional\n       judgment.\n                The reason that those were concerning to me when I saw\n       them in the report was two things that I would want to speak with him\n       about would be whether to request a competency evaluation or\n       whether to possibly advance a defense of diminished responsibility\n       at trial. I think that I exercised reasonable professional judgment in\n       dealing with those issues, because except with respect to the\n       competency evaluation, although I didn\u2019t know that Mr. Newman had\n       received special education services, I was very aware that he\n       limited\u2014that he was obviously, the product of a poor school. And in\n       talking with him about his case, I looked very closely at how he would\n       process information and make decisions.\n                We talked about, in this case, obviously, he has a lot of bad\n       options. We talked about some of the things that were very\n       complicated. We talked about the registry and special sentences\n       and how that information would affect him, potentially, for his whole\n       life if he was convicted as charged. During those conversations,\n       which were really complex, Mr. Newman was able to appropriately\n       process the information, weigh it, and make what I thought was the\n       best decision. So that raised absolutely no concerns for me\n       whatsoever about his competency.\n                And a second piece of information that was relevant to me in\n       exercising professional judgment on those grounds was when we got\n       the DNA test results back I was able to discuss that with Mr.\n       Newman, and I felt like he was really able to appreciate how having\n\f                                        4\n\n\n      those results changed the strength of the State\u2019s case, making trial\n      a much worse option for him to pursue.\n             Those are just a few of the examples of why I would not have\n      moved for a competency evaluation in this case. And for the same\n      reasons, I would say that I wouldn\u2019t have advanced, and I don\u2019t think\n      Mr. Newman would have wanted me to advance, a diminished\n      responsibility defense at trial.\n             We made our decision to plead guilty recognizing that it was\n      the best option for Mr. Newman amongst a whole bunch of really bad\n      options. And I don\u2019t think anything about that information that I\u2014that\n      I learned from the PSI would change that or would change Mr.\n      Newman\u2019s desire to continue with this guilty plea. Thank you.\n             COURT: All right.\n             Mr. Newman, you heard the statement of [defense counsel].\n      Do you understand what he was talking about?\n             NEWMAN: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor.\n             COURT: Do you have any comments or do you have any\n      disagreement with anything that he said?\n             NEWMAN: No.\n             COURT: Okay. I need an answer out loud.\n             NEWMAN: No.\n             COURT: Okay. We had a lengthy discussion during the plea\n      hearing, and it appeared to me during that hearing that you were\n      processing everything well and understood everything well during\n      the hearing; is that correct?\n             NEWMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n      The district court proceeded and imposed Newman\u2019s sentence. Newman\n\nappealed.\n\nII.   Good Cause to Appeal\n\n      Preliminarily, the State argues that the court \u201cshould dismiss the appeal\u201d\n\nbecause \u201cNewman has no right of appeal from his guilty plea\u201d under Iowa Code\n\nsection 814.6 (Supp. 2019), his conviction was not for a class \u201cA\u201d felony, and he\n\n\u201chas not alleged or established \u2018good cause\u2019 as to why the appeal should be\n\npermitted to proceed.\u201d1 Iowa Code section 814.6(1)(a)(3) provides: \u201cRight of\n\n\n1 Because the district court entered Newman\u2019s judgment of conviction and\nsentence after July 1, 2019, the statutory amendment to section 814.6 restricting\nappeals from guilty pleas is applicable to his appeal.\n\f                                         5\n\n\nappeal is granted the defendant from [a] final judgment of sentence, except . . . [a]\n\nconviction where the defendant has pled guilty,\u201d unless \u201cthe defendant establishes\n\ngood cause.\u201d \u201cGood cause\u201d means a \u201clegally sufficient reason.\u201d State v. Tucker,\n\n959 N.W.2d 140, 153 (Iowa 2021) (quoting State v. Damme, 944 N.W.2d 98, 104\n\n(Iowa 2020)). \u201cA legally sufficient reason to appeal as a matter of right is a reason\n\nthat, at a minimum, would allow a court to provide some relief on direct appeal.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n       Newman has not addressed the good-cause issue with respect to his claim\n\nof incompetence at the time of his guilty plea. But \u201c[t]his court has addressed the\n\nissue and concluded \u2018that good cause exists to challenge competency at the time\n\nof the plea irrespective of whether the issue was contested below.\u2019\u201d State v.\n\nChindlund, No. 20-1368, 2021 WL 2708944, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. June 30, 2021)\n\n(quoting State v. Cue, No. 19-2150, 2020 WL 6157813, at *3 (Iowa Ct. App. Oct.\n\n21, 2020)). Accordingly, we find Newman has good cause to proceed with this\n\nappeal.2\n\nIII.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       Newman first contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\n\nthat he be \u201cexamined for competency\u201d or use his \u201cmental health state to assert a\n\ndiminished capacity defense.\u201d The State again responds that recent statutory\n\namendments preclude consideration of this claim. See Iowa Code \u00a7 814.7 (stating\n\nan ineffective-assistance-of-counsel \u201cclaim shall not be decided on direct appeal\n\n\n2 The State filed a motion to dismiss premised upon the same grounds\u2014that\nNewman failed to show good cause\u2014and the motion was ordered to be submitted\nwith this appeal. For the reasons provided, we find it unnecessary to further\naddress the motion.\n\f                                          6\n\n\nfrom the criminal proceedings\u201d).       On this point, we agree with the State.\n\nAccordingly, we do not address the merits of Newman\u2019s claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in this direct appeal.\n\nIV.    Competency\n\n       Newman\u2019s second issue is directed to whether the district court erred in\n\nfailing to order a competency hearing.3 According to Newman, \u201cBased on the\n\ninformation in the transcript[] of the plea, sentencing and the PSI Report,[4] there is\n\na basis for determining that [he] may not have been competent to stand trial and\n\nshould have been given a competency hearing and subsequent examination.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Newman contends the court failed to make further inquiry into his\n\ncompetency after it \u201chad access to [the] PSI report which stated that [he] suffered\n\nfrom bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia and had special education in school.\u201d\n\n       \u201cUnder the United States Constitution, the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas declared that the conviction of an incompetent defendant violates due\n\nprocess.\u201d State v. Einfeldt, 914 N.W.2d 773, 778 (Iowa 2018). \u201cWe review whether\n\na trial court should have ordered a competency hearing de novo.\u201d Id.\n\n       Iowa Code section 812.3(1) provides:\n\n              If at any stage of a criminal proceeding the defendant or the\n       defendant\u2019s attorney, upon application to the court, alleges specific\n       facts showing that the defendant is suffering from a mental disorder\n       which prevents the defendant from appreciating the charge,\n       understanding the proceedings, or assisting effectively in the\n\n3 The State does not contend Newman\u2019s appeal of this issue is foreclosed by the\namendments to Iowa Code sections 814.6 and 814.7.                  The State also\nacknowledges that a claim the district court failed to order a competency hearing\nsua sponte is not subject to traditional rules of error preservation. See State v.\nLucas, 323 N.W.2d 228, 230 (Iowa 1982).\n4 Newman acknowledges no evidence existed in this record to order a competency\n\nhearing until the PSI was prepared for the sentencing hearing.\n\f                                          7\n\n\n       defense, the court shall suspend further proceedings and determine\n       if probable cause exists to sustain the allegations. The applicant has\n       the burden of establishing probable cause. The court may on its own\n       motion schedule a hearing to determine probable cause if the\n       defendant or defendant\u2019s attorney has failed or refused to make an\n       application under this section and the court finds that there are\n       specific facts showing that a hearing should be held on that question.\n\n(Emphasis added.) There is a presumption that a defendant is competent to stand\n\ntrial, and the defendant has the burden to prove incompetence. See State v.\n\nGaston, No. 18-1293, 2020 WL 1307690, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2020). The\n\nquestion here is whether there were \u201cspecific facts\u201d regarding Newman\u2019s\n\ncompetency that required the court to order a competency hearing sua sponte.\n\nSee Iowa Code \u00a7 812.3(1).\n\n       In Einfeldt, the court reversed the defendant\u2019s judgment and remanded for\n\na new trial upon concluding the factors before the district court (i.e., the defendant\n\ninformed defense counsel that she \u201csuffered from mental health issues in the past\u201d\n\nand defense counsel informed the court \u201cregarding the difficulty of representation\u201d;\n\nthe defendant testified she \u201cwant[ed] to kill her lawyer and stab her lawyer in the\n\nneck with a pen\u201d and that she believed \u201csomeone was \u2018poisoning the water\u2019\u201d; the\n\ndefendant did not understand the charges against her and \u201cdid not remember the\n\nevents of the previous day\u201d; the defendant told the court \u201cshe had been diagnosed\n\nwith paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and\n\nattention deficit disorder\u201d and \u201cshe had prescriptions for these disorders but had\n\nnot been taking her medication for a couple of months because she did not have\n\nthe money\u201d; and the PSI corroborated the defendant\u2019s statements and\n\n\u201crecommended an assessment by a licensed professional\u201d) should have led a\n\f                                         8\n\n\nreasonable trial judge to experience doubt on whether the defendant was\n\ncompetent to stand trial. 914 N.W.2d at 777\u201378, 781\u201383.\n\n       Newman seeks the same resolution here. However, after consideration of\n\nthe appropriate factors, we conclude there is insufficient evidence to meet even\n\nthe \u201clow threshold\u201d noted in Einfeldt, and we decline to determine the district court\n\ncommitted legal error in failing to order a competency hearing pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode section 812.3 on the record before us. Cf. id. at 782. Although the PSI\n\nprovided information regarding Newman\u2019s past diagnoses of several mental-health\n\nissues, we note that the PSI also stated Newman was taking his medication while\n\nin custody. We are not privy to know whether medications were taken, as Newman\n\nstated during the guilty plea proceeding that he was not on any medication. We\n\nacknowledge the district court may have been well advised to inquire at the\n\nsentencing hearing concerning Newman\u2019s use of any medications.\n\n       Notwithstanding, we find it significant that defense counsel informed the\n\ncourt that he had no concern about Newman\u2019s mental health based on their\n\ninteractions. Newman concedes, \u201cThe Trial Court is to give great weight based on\n\nthe statements of trail [sic] counsel regarding their client\u2019s competency.\u201d Here,\n\ndefense counsel spoke at length at sentencing and noted no difficulties in\n\ncommunications with Newman. Defense counsel also noted a lack of any irrational\n\ncomments or behavior by Newman during the guilty plea proceeding and other\n\nattorney-client discussions, and the fact that Newman appeared to understand and\n\nproperly respond to the court\u2019s colloquy and other statements. Cf. id. at 780\u201381\n\n(noting \u201c[c]ompetency evaluations include a \u2018careful assessment of the accused\u2019s\n\nability to interact with counsel\u2019\u201d and a \u201cprofessional statement\u201d by defense counsel\n\f                                         9\n\n\nregarding representation \u201cplays an important role\u201d (citation omitted)). We also note\n\nthat \u201c[a] history of mental illness standing alone . . . does not mean the defendant\n\nis incompetent.\u201d State v. Edwards, 507 N.W.2d 393, 395 (Iowa 1993).\n\n       It may have helped our resolution if the district court had inquired\n\nconcerning Newman\u2019s mental-health issues and medication, but without any\n\nunusual conduct, improper responses, or apprehension by defense counsel we\n\nconclude these facts and circumstances are insufficient to order a competency\n\nevaluation under Iowa Code 812.3. See, e.g., Chindlund, 2021 WL 2708944, at\n\n*3 (\u201c[O]n the record presented, Chindlund has failed to meet his burden to prove\n\nhe was incompetent when his guilty plea was accepted.\u201d); Cue, 2020 WL 6157813,\n\nat *4 (\u201cIn sum, Cue failed to show any behavior suggesting he was incompetent to\n\nplead guilty.\u201d). We reach these conclusions notwithstanding the fact that \u201cany one\n\nfactor alone may sufficiently raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable\n\ntrial judge.\u201d Einfeldt, 914 N.W.2d at 781. And we acknowledge a more adequate\n\nrecord may be developed in postconviction-relief proceedings. See Chindlund,\n\n2021 WL 2708944, at *3 (\u201c[Chindlund\u2019s] claim is better suited for postconviction\n\nrelief where an adequate record may be developed.\u201d).\n\n       We affirm Newman\u2019s conviction.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                    IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF IOWA\n\n                                  No. 19-1228\n                           Filed September 22, 2021\n\n\nSTATE OF IOWA,\n     Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\nvs.\n\nDANTREON LEVON NEWMAN,\n     Defendant-Appellant.\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n      Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Jeffrey Farrell, Judge.\n\n\n\n      Dantreon Newman appeals following his guilty plea to lascivious acts with\n\na child.

He contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to\n\nrequest that he be \u201cexamined for competency\u201d or use his \u201cmental health state to\n\nassert a diminished capacity defense\u201d and the district court \u201cshould have ordered\n\na competency hearing.\u201d Upon our review, we affirm.\n\nI.     Factual Background\n\n       Newman was charged with third-degree sexual abuse following an incident\n\nin which he solicited a thirteen-year-old female to an abandoned apartment, where\n\nhe forced her to engage in sexual intercourse. A plea agreement was reached, in\n\nwhich Newman agreed to plead guilty to lascivious acts with a child\u2013solicitation, a\n\nclass \u201cD\u201d felony. See Iowa Code \u00a7 709.8(1)(d) (2017).\n\n       At the plea hearing, the district court engaged Newman in a colloquy to\n\nestablish that his guilty plea was knowing, voluntary, and supported by a factual\n\nbasis. The court inquired into Newman\u2019s mental competency through several\n\nquestions, to which Newman answered that he was not \u201cunder the influence of an\n\nalcoholic beverage, drug, or medication\u201d; he was not \u201cseeing a doctor, psychiatrist,\n\nor psychologist\u201d; and he had not \u201cbeen hospitalized in the last six months.\u201d\n\nNewman agreed he was pleading guilty \u201cvoluntarily and of [my] own free will,\u201d\n\n\u201cbecause . . . it\u2019s about the best option\u2014the best way to go.\u201d He further stated he\n\nunderstood his rights and the consequences of pleading guilty, and the court\n\naccepted his plea.\n\n       Newman waived his right to file a motion in arrest of judgment to challenge\n\nhis plea. Meanwhile, the State prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI).\n\f                                         3\n\n\nThe PSI indicated Newman \u201c[h]as been diagnosed with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder,\n\nand Schizophrenia\u201d and was \u201ctaking medication to address these issues while in\n\nthe Polk County Jail.\u201d The PSI further noted Newman \u201cwas involved in special\n\neducation programming while in school\u201d and was \u201cinterested in obtaining his GED\n\nin the future.\u201d\n\n       Newman later appeared for sentencing with counsel. At the outset of the\n\nhearing, defense counsel addressed the court regarding \u201csomething that appeared\n\nin the [PSI].\u201d The following colloquy then took place:\n\n                DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, I just wanted to make a little\n       record about references in this report to special education and\n       mental health diagnoses by Mr. Newman of schizophrenia and\n       bipolar. Those were things that I was not aware of at the time of his\n       plea, but, nonetheless, I exercised a reasonable professional\n       judgment.\n                The reason that those were concerning to me when I saw\n       them in the report was two things that I would want to speak with him\n       about would be whether to request a competency evaluation or\n       whether to possibly advance a defense of diminished responsibility\n       at trial. I think that I exercised reasonable professional judgment in\n       dealing with those issues, because except with respect to the\n       competency evaluation, although I didn\u2019t know that Mr. Newman had\n       received special education services, I was very aware that he\n       limited\u2014that he was obviously, the product of a poor school. And in\n       talking with him about his case, I looked very closely at how he would\n       process information and make decisions.\n                We talked about, in this case, obviously, he has a lot of bad\n       options. We talked about some of the things that were very\n       complicated. We talked about the registry and special sentences\n       and how that information would affect him, potentially, for his whole\n       life if he was convicted as charged. During those conversations,\n       which were really complex, Mr. Newman was able to appropriately\n       process the information, weigh it, and make what I thought was the\n       best decision. So that raised absolutely no concerns for me\n       whatsoever about his competency.\n                And a second piece of information that was relevant to me in\n       exercising professional judgment on those grounds was when we got\n       the DNA test results back I was able to discuss that with Mr.\n       Newman, and I felt like he was really able to appreciate how having\n\f                                        4\n\n\n      those results changed the strength of the State\u2019s case, making trial\n      a much worse option for him to pursue.\n             Those are just a few of the examples of why I would not have\n      moved for a competency evaluation in this case. And for the same\n      reasons, I would say that I wouldn\u2019t have advanced, and I don\u2019t think\n      Mr. Newman would have wanted me to advance, a diminished\n      responsibility defense at trial.\n             We made our decision to plead guilty recognizing that it was\n      the best option for Mr. Newman amongst a whole bunch of really bad\n      options. And I don\u2019t think anything about that information that I\u2014that\n      I learned from the PSI would change that or would change Mr.\n      Newman\u2019s desire to continue with this guilty plea. Thank you.\n             COURT: All right.\n             Mr. Newman, you heard the statement of [defense counsel].\n      Do you understand what he was talking about?\n             NEWMAN: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor.\n             COURT: Do you have any comments or do you have any\n      disagreement with anything that he said?\n             NEWMAN: No.\n             COURT: Okay. I need an answer out loud.\n             NEWMAN: No.\n             COURT: Okay. We had a lengthy discussion during the plea\n      hearing, and it appeared to me during that hearing that you were\n      processing everything well and understood everything well during\n      the hearing; is that correct?\n             NEWMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n      The district court proceeded and imposed Newman\u2019s sentence. Newman\n\nappealed.\n\nII.   Good Cause to Appeal\n\n      Preliminarily, the State argues that the court \u201cshould dismiss the appeal\u201d\n\nbecause \u201cNewman has no right of appeal from his guilty plea\u201d under Iowa Code\n\nsection 814.6 (Supp. 2019), his conviction was not for a class \u201cA\u201d felony, and he\n\n\u201chas not alleged or established \u2018good cause\u2019 as to why the appeal should be\n\npermitted to proceed.\u201d1 Iowa Code section 814.6(1)(a)(3) provides: \u201cRight of\n\n\n1 Because the district court entered Newman\u2019s judgment of conviction and\nsentence after July 1, 2019, the statutory amendment to section 814.6 restricting\nappeals from guilty pleas is applicable to his appeal.\n\f                                         5\n\n\nappeal is granted the defendant from [a] final judgment of sentence, except . . . [a]\n\nconviction where the defendant has pled guilty,\u201d unless \u201cthe defendant establishes\n\ngood cause.\u201d \u201cGood cause\u201d means a \u201clegally sufficient reason.\u201d State v. Tucker,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">959 N.W.2d 140</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (Iowa 2021) (quoting State v. Damme, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">944 N.W.2d 98</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104\n\n(Iowa 2020)). \u201cA legally sufficient reason to appeal as a matter of right is a reason\n\nthat, at a minimum, would allow a court to provide some relief on direct appeal.\u201d\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n       Newman has not addressed the good-cause issue with respect to his claim\n\nof incompetence at the time of his guilty plea.

Accordingly, we find Newman has good cause to proceed with this\n\nappeal.2\n\nIII.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       Newman first contends his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\n\nthat he be \u201cexamined for competency\u201d or use his \u201cmental health state to assert a\n\ndiminished capacity defense.\u201d The State again responds that recent statutory\n\namendments preclude consideration of this claim. See Iowa Code \u00a7 814.7 (stating\n\nan ineffective-assistance-of-counsel \u201cclaim shall not be decided on direct appeal\n\n\n2 The State filed a motion to dismiss premised upon the same grounds\u2014that\nNewman failed to show good cause\u2014and the motion was ordered to be submitted\nwith this appeal. For the reasons provided, we find it unnecessary to further\naddress the motion.\n\f                                          6\n\n\nfrom the criminal proceedings\u201d).       On this point, we agree with the State.\n\nAccordingly, we do not address the merits of Newman\u2019s claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in this direct appeal.\n\nIV.    Competency\n\n       Newman\u2019s second issue is directed to whether the district court erred in\n\nfailing to order a competency hearing.3 According to Newman, \u201cBased on the\n\ninformation in the transcript[] of the plea, sentencing and the PSI Report,[4] there is\n\na basis for determining that [he] may not have been competent to stand trial and\n\nshould have been given a competency hearing and subsequent examination.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Newman contends the court failed to make further inquiry into his\n\ncompetency after it \u201chad access to [the] PSI report which stated that [he] suffered\n\nfrom bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia and had special education in school.\u201d\n\n       \u201cUnder the United States Constitution, the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas declared that the conviction of an incompetent defendant violates due\n\nprocess.\u201d State v.

However, after consideration of\n\nthe appropriate factors, we conclude there is insufficient evidence to meet even\n\nthe \u201clow threshold\u201d noted in Einfeldt, and we decline to determine the district court\n\ncommitted legal error in failing to order a competency hearing pursuant to Iowa\n\nCode section 812.3 on the record before us. Cf. id. at 782. Although the PSI\n\nprovided information regarding Newman\u2019s past diagnoses of several mental-health\n\nissues, we note that the PSI also stated Newman was taking his medication while\n\nin custody. We are not privy to know whether medications were taken, as Newman\n\nstated during the guilty plea proceeding that he was not on any medication. We\n\nacknowledge the district court may have been well advised to inquire at the\n\nsentencing hearing concerning Newman\u2019s use of any medications.\n\n       Notwithstanding, we find it significant that defense counsel informed the\n\ncourt that he had no concern about Newman\u2019s mental health based on their\n\ninteractions. Newman concedes, \u201cThe Trial Court is to give great weight based on\n\nthe statements of trail [sic] counsel regarding their client\u2019s competency.\u201d Here,\n\ndefense counsel spoke at length at sentencing and noted no difficulties in\n\ncommunications with Newman. Defense counsel also noted a lack of any irrational\n\ncomments or behavior by Newman during the guilty plea proceeding and other\n\nattorney-client discussions, and the fact that Newman appeared to understand and\n\nproperly respond to the court\u2019s colloquy and other statements.

Therefore, grounds for termination exist pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 232.116(1)(h). On our de novo review, we conclude the father did not carry\n\nhis burden to show the father-child bond was such that termination of his parental\n\nrights would be detrimental to the child; rather, termination of parental rights and\n\nadoption will best provide for the child\u2019s safety; long-term nurturing and growth;\n\nand physical, mental, and emotional condition and needs. We therefore affirm.\n\n       I. Background Facts.\n\n       The child tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine at birth and\n\nwas in the mother\u2019s custody and care for only four days before voluntarily being\n\nplaced in foster care. The department of human services (DHS) became involved.\n\nThe mother reported the father was not taking his prescribed mental-health\n\nmedication and expressed fear of him because he was abusive. DHS helped the\n\nmother move to a domestic-violence shelter. However, after less than two weeks,\n\n\n\n\n1 The mother\u2019s rights were also terminated. She did not appeal.\n2 At the time of the termination hearing, D.M. had been out of parental custody for\ntwenty-five months. The statutory period is \u201cat least six months of the last twelve\nmonths, or for the last six consecutive months and any trial period at home has\nbeen less than thirty days.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(1)(h)(3) (2021).\n\f                                          3\n\n\nthe mother left the shelter, and DHS did not hear from her for several weeks. The\n\nfather was arrested on assault charges.\n\n       On April 10, the State filed a CINA petition. A May 7 hearing on the petition\n\nwas continued because the father was hospitalized after a suicide attempt.\n\n       The child was adjudicated CINA on June 4, 2019. Pending the disposition\n\nhearing, the father was ordered to participate in Family Safety, Risk, and\n\nPermanency (FSRP) services; complete mental-health and substance-abuse\n\nevaluations and follow through with recommended treatment; and sign all\n\nnecessary releases requested by DHS and service providers. On June 18, the\n\ncourt entered an ex parte removal order, placing the child in DHS\u2019s custody and\n\nfinding in part:\n\n       [The mother] and [father] have been provided visitation with the\n       children supervised by FSRP. The parents have been cooperative\n       at visitation but are not consistent with their attendance to the visits.\n       Both parents have not confirmed visits timely or have been late to\n       visits on more than one occasion. Both parents agreed to complete\n       substance abuse evaluations. Those evaluations have not yet been\n       completed. [The father] has reported completed drug testing through\n       probation office. [He] was hospitalized for concerns with self-harm\n       and his overall mental health. Since hospitalization [DHS] has not\n       had any contact with [the father] and FSRP expresses that they\n       struggle in making contact with [him].\n\n       The father obtained a mental-health assessment on July 26. The father has\n\nissues of domestic violence, anger control, and self-reported long histories of\n\nsubstance use (marijuana) and multiple significant mental-health diagnoses. The\n\nevaluator recommended the father obtain a psychiatric evaluation and participate\n\nin ongoing individual therapy to deal with severe depression, anxiety, and\n\ndevelopment of appropriate communication skills.\n\f                                         4\n\n\n       On September 10, a dispositional order was filed, which required the father\n\nto comply with services as requested by DHS or providers, cooperate with all\n\nservices as directed in the case permanency plan, obtain a substance-abuse\n\nevaluation and follow through with any recommended treatment, cooperate with\n\nsubstance-abuse aftercare or support programs, cooperate and participate in\n\nrandom drug testing, obtain a mental-health evaluation and follow through with\n\nrecommended treatment, obtain and maintain safe appropriate housing, and\n\nmaintain employment. The court ordered funding for family counseling, mental-\n\nhealth and substance-abuse evaluations and treatment, and drug testing.\n\n       The father attended a counseling session on August 2. However, he did\n\nnot attend an August 19 session because he was again in jail. His next scheduled\n\nappointment was for September 6, but he did not show. He was discharged from\n\ncounseling due to lack of attendance. For the remainder of 2019, the father\u2019s\n\nparticipation in services was minimal and his visits with the child were sporadic.\n\n       A February 25, 2020 report to the court prior to a CINA review hearing noted\n\nthe father had been arrested in mid-January, had not been in contact with DHS,\n\nand had not been provided visits while in jail. When a worker visited the father in\n\njail, she reported he had not been taking his prescribed mental-health medication\n\nwhile incarcerated. The father reported he would be released soon.\n\n       In March, the juvenile court filed a CINA review order continuing the father\u2019s\n\nrequirements he comply and cooperate with DHS services, obtain a substance-\n\nabuse evaluation and follow through with recommendations, cooperate with\n\nrandom drug testing, obtain a mental-health evaluation and follow through with\n\f                                          5\n\n\nrecommended services, obtain housing, obtain and maintain employment\n\nexpectations, cooperate with visitation, and cooperate with paternity testing.\n\n       The father was released from jail in March and contacted DHS to resume\n\nvisits with D.M. However, he did not attend a scheduled meeting with DHS service\n\nworkers.\n\n       An April 14 FSRP report observed:\n\n               Cognitive: [The father] is not aligned with the needs of [the\n       child]. [The father] does not possess adequate knowledge to fulfill\n       his caregiving responsibilities. [He] is not reality oriented. [The\n       father] stated he did not attend interactions with [the child] for fear\n       that he would be arrested.\n               Behavioral: [The father] is not physically able to provide care\n       to [the child] at this time due to being incarcerated. [The father] does\n       not demonstrate impulse control as he has continued to engage in\n       illegal activities. [The father] does not set aside his needs for [the\n       child].\n               Emotional: [The father] displays concern for [the child]. [The\n       father] does express love toward [the child]. [The father] is not\n       bonded to [the child] due to his limited contact with him.\n\n       In a June 2 DHS report to the court in anticipation of a permanency hearing,\n\nthe DHS worker indicated she had reached the father via phone call on April 10,\n\nexplained that visits could not be face-to-face due to COVID-19 and would be by\n\nvideo, and shared with the father he needed to follow through with paternity testing\n\nand psychiatric testing. Further attempts to contact the father were unsuccessful.\n\nThe worker recommended the permanency goal be changed to termination of\n\nparental rights and the father \u201ccomplete a comprehensive and thorough psychiatric\n\nevaluation with approved court ordered funding and follow through with the\n\nrecommendations.\u201d\n\f                                        6\n\n\n      In an addendum to her earlier report, the DHS worker noted the father\u2019s\n\npaternity had been confirmed. The worker also noted she had met with the father\n\non June 18:\n\n      At that time it was addressed that he needed to complete psychiatric\n      testing with Pat Ewing. [The father] reported that he was currently\n      participating in counseling at Counseling Associates and received\n      medication management through his primary care provider. [The\n      father] was asked that he attend drug testing along with paternity\n      testing. [The father] agreed that he would be able to make\n      arrangements for drug testing if given a call the day of testing but\n      shared if he had to leave the county then he would need approval\n      from his [probation officer (PO)]. This worker let him know that\n      worker would speak with his PO for approval for this. Arrangements\n      were also made for visitation between [the father] and [the child]. It\n      was agreed [the father] would have one visit weekly and if he could\n      show consistency in these visits they would be increased. [FSRP\n      provider] scheduled a visit with [the child] and [the father] for the\n      following week.\n              [The father] was attempted to be reached by phone and then\n      sent a text message on [July 8] that he needed to attend drug testing\n      [July 10]. [The father] was informed that worker had spoken with his\n      PO and that he would be able to leave the county for this. [The\n      father] texted on [July 9] sharing that he needed more of a heads up\n      for testing as he was busy and would not be able to make it. This\n      worker explained through text that it is random drug testing and he\n      was given [two] days advanced notice. [The father] did not attend\n      this testing or respond to workers message.\n              [The father] was sent for drug testing again on [July 17]. He\n      did attend this and hair stat testing was completed. Hair stat test\n      results were received on [August 5] and these were positive for THC.\n      In prior conversations with [the father] he had maintained that he has\n      been sober since last year.\n\n      Further, the report noted the DHS worker had contacted Counseling\n\nAssociates\u2014the father was not involved in counseling between November 2019\n\nand May 2020, was seen once in June, and did not show in July. Pat Ewing was\n\nalso contacted and reported receiving a message from the father weeks before\n\nabout scheduling a psychiatric evaluation. However, Ewing\u2019s attempts to reach\n\nthe father to do set the appointment were unsuccessful. With respect to visits, the\n\f                                         7\n\n\naddendum noted the father was inconsistent with visits and the child was hesitant\n\nto go to the father.\n\n       After a September permanency review hearing, the court found:\n\n               That since the time of the last hearing, there has been a\n       continued lack of progress in regards to completion and participation\n       in court-ordered services by both the parents. Very limited contact\n       with [the father] and he has not been involved or communicated with\n       the worker in regards to making arrangement for services and\n       visitation.\n\nHowever, the mother had made some progress and the court granted an additional\n\nsix months \u201cat which time the court shall hold a hearing to consider modification of\n\nits permanency order.\u201d\n\n       In a January 20, 2021 progress report by FSRP (now known as Family-\n\nCentered Services or FCS), the worker noted the child was well-bonded with the\n\nfoster family and the father was \u201ctrying to get a medical card for THC still\u201d and\n\n\u201cwaiting for funding for his mental health evaluation.\u201d3 The father indicated he had\n\n\u201cvarious mental health diagnoses,\u201d and reported \u201cthe only issue regarding his\n\nportion of the case was the THC.\u201d\n\n       A February 14, progress report states, in part:\n\n       [The father] has reported that he does not use illegal substances\n       except THC. He said that he is in the process of trying to get a\n       medical marijuana card. He takes daily medication. Evaluations\n       have not been done yet by [the father]. He is in the process of getting\n       his birth certificate for more stable employment.\n\n       At a March 9 permanency review hearing, the State indicated an intent to\n\nfile a petition to terminate parental rights. The parties agreed to combine the\n\n\n\n3It is unclear why the earlier court orders were not sufficient to ensure funding was\navailable.\n\f                                           8\n\n\npermanency-review and termination hearings, which would be scheduled after the\n\ntermination petition was filed.\n\n         FCS filed its April 14 progress report, stating, \u201c[The father] reports that he\n\nhas not set up his evaluations set up yet. Options were discussed for options for\n\npsychiatrists. He reports that he will set them up. He reports no use of illegal\n\nsubstances and that he is working regularly.\u201d Visits between father and child were\n\nfully supervised once a week for two hours, having recently been extended by one-\n\nhalf hour.\n\n         On April 27, DHS submitted a report to court for purposes of the combined\n\nhearings, noting the father had obtained housing on March 9 and was more\n\nconsistent with visits. However, the father had not followed through with routine\n\ncounseling over the course of the case, still had not obtained a psychiatric\n\nevaluation, and was not taking his prescribed mental-health medications.\n\nMoreover, although a March 2021 substance-abuse evaluation did not recommend\n\ntreatment, it was because the father \u201cmade it clear he did not intend on stopping\n\nhis use of marijuana and that he was in hopes of obtaining a medical marijuana\n\ncard.\u201d\n\n         During the combined permanency and termination hearing held on April 27,\n\nevidence was presented the father had been in jail several times (each stay\n\nranging from a week to three months). The court found the father had made some\n\n\u201climited progress\u201d since the March 9 hearing, however, the court noted that to\n\nreturn the child to the father would likely subject the child to adjudicatory harm;\n\n\u201cThe child\u2019s father . . . is habitually in and out of incarceration and cannot care for\n\nthe child while incarcerated. With the exception of approximately the last month,\n\f                                         9\n\n\n[the father] participates very minimally in services and there remain serious\n\nconcerns regarding his future drug use and mental health.\u201d The court observed\n\nthe father\u2019s frequent stays in jail \u201ccreat[e] a hectic and unstable environment that\n\nwould not allow for proper or safe care of the child.\u201d The court concluded,\n\n       While the court applauds [the father\u2019s] very recent efforts, they are\n       simply too little too late and are not enough to show a stable and\n       consistent ability to properly care and provide for the mental,\n       emotional, physical, and developmental needs of the child. He has\n       not sufficiently addressed his mental health needs nor sufficiently\n       addressed his substance abuse needs.\n\n       The court noted there was a \u201cconnection\u201d between father and child but the\n\nchild had a \u201cvery strong bond with his current foster parents,\u201d with whom he had\n\nbeen placed for seventeen months. The court found the foster parents were willing\n\nto adopt the child and provide a permanent home where the child\u2019s physical,\n\ndevelopmental, psychological, and emotional needs would be met. Thus, the\n\nchild\u2019s best interests would be served by terminating parental rights.\n\n       The father appeals.\n\n       II. Scope and Standard of Review.\n\n       Review of all termination proceedings is de novo. In re P.L., 778 N.W.2d\n\n33, 40 (Iowa 2010). Under de novo review, \u201c[w]e review both the facts and the law\n\nand adjudicate rights anew on the issues properly presented.\u201d In re A.T., 799\n\nN.W.2d 148, 150\u201351 (Iowa Ct. App. 2011). \u201cWe give weight to the juvenile court\u2019s\n\nfindings, but are not bound by them. Our paramount concern is the child\u2019s best\n\ninterests.\u201d Id. at 151.\n\n       III. Discussion.\n\f                                          10\n\n\n        The father concedes all but the fourth element of Iowa Code section\n\n232.116(1)(h) are established.4 He argues there is not clear and convincing\n\nevidence the child could not be returned to him at the time of the termination\n\nhearing because he had a house DHS found suitable for a child, he was employed,\n\nthere were no concerns mentioned by caseworkers about his parenting ability\n\nduring visits, and there is no evidence his mental health affects his ability to parent.\n\nHe also notes he had a clean drug screen in the spring of 2021 and his substance-\n\nabuse evaluation recommended no treatment.\n\n        Like the district court, we applaud the father\u2019s very recent efforts toward\n\nhousing and job stability. However, we are concerned those efforts did not begin\n\nuntil March 2021 when the child has been out of parental custody since March\n\n2019.    See In re C.B., 611 N.W.2d 489, 495 (Iowa 2000) (\u201cInsight for the\n\ndetermination of the child\u2019s long-range best interests can be gleaned from\n\n\u2018evidence of the parent\u2019s past performance for that performance may be indicative\n\nof the quality of the future care that parent is capable of providing.\u2019\u201d (citation\n\nomitted)). The father has still not adequately addressed his domestic-violence and\n\n\n4 Section 232.116(1)(h) allows the court to terminate parental rights if all of the\nfollowing have occurred:\n                (1) The child is three years of age or younger.\n                (2) The child has been adjudicated a [CINA] pursuant to\n        section 232.96.\n                (3) The child has been removed from the physical custody of\n        the child\u2019s parents for at least six months of the last twelve months,\n        or for the last six consecutive months and any trial period at home\n        has been less than thirty days.\n                (4) There is clear and convincing evidence that the child\n        cannot be returned to the custody of the child\u2019s parents . . . at the\n        present time.\n\u201c[A]t the present time\u201d means at the time of the termination hearing. See In re\nA.M., 843 N.W.2d 100, 111 (Iowa 2014).\n\f                                          11\n\n\nmental-health issues. He has not obtained a psychiatric evaluation\u2014which was\n\nrecommended multiple times since July 2019. The father has been court-ordered\n\nto follow such recommendations since the child was adjudicated a CINA. The\n\nfather minimizes these concerns, but we cannot. He reported to the mental-health\n\nevaluator that he was negatively affected by domestic violence and child abuse in\n\nhis childhood home. He noted he suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which\n\ninduces flashbacks. He reported feelings of anxiety and depression and has been\n\nhospitalized because he was suicidal. He is prescribed medications to address\n\nthese concerns and was urged to participate in ongoing individual therapy. He has\n\nnot followed through with those recommendations and self-medicates with\n\nmarijuana.\n\n       We are not persuaded he can provide a child\u2014or himself\u2014emotional or\n\nphysical stability and security. He also minimizes the effect his several stays in jail\n\nhave had on his child\u2019s life. Even if two of the charges were dismissed after a time,\n\nhe has been convicted of domestic-abuse assault, and his absences while\n\navoiding arrest and in jail have necessarily kept him unavailable for services,\n\nunable to parent, and missing the opportunity for parent-child bonding.           The\n\nfather\u2019s ability to attend to a child for two hours once a week while fully supervised\n\ndoes not carry much weight in the balance. \u201cParenting cannot be turned off and\n\non like a spigot. It must be constant, responsible, and reliable.\u201d In re T.J.O., 527\n\nN.W.2d 417, 422 (Iowa Ct. App. 1994). We conclude there is clear and convincing\n\nevidence the child could not be safely returned to the father\u2019s care at the time of\n\nthe termination hearing.\n\f                                          12\n\n\n       The father next asserts termination is not appropriate due to the closeness\n\nof his bond with the child. Iowa Code section 232.116(3)(c) allows the juvenile\n\ncourt to avoid termination if \u201c[t]here is clear and convincing evidence that the\n\ntermination would be detrimental to the child at the time due to the closeness of\n\nthe parent-child relationship.\u201d We note the application of the statutory exception\n\nto termination is \u201cpermissive, not mandatory.\u201d A.M., 843 N.W.2d at 113. The\n\njuvenile court found there was a \u201cconnection\u201d between father and child but a\n\n\u201cstrong bond\u201d between child and foster parents. We find the evidence of the\n\nfather\u2019s connection insufficient to show \u201ctermination would be detrimental to the\n\nchild . . . due to the closeness of the parent-child relationship\u201d See In re A.S., 906\n\nN.W.2d 467, 476 (Iowa 2018) (noting the parent resisting termination bears the\n\nburden to establish an exception to termination).\n\n       Finally, the father asserts termination is not in the child\u2019s best interests. This\n\nchild has been out of parental custody for all but four days of the child\u2019s life and for\n\nfar more than the statutory period. The statutory period has been far exceeded\n\nhere, and we must view the situation with a sense of urgency. See C.B., 611\n\nN.W.2d at 495.\n\n       Giving \u201cprimary consideration to the child\u2019s safety, to the best placement for\n\nfurthering the long-term nurturing and growth of the child, and to the physical,\n\nmental, and emotional condition and needs of the child,\u201d see Iowa Code\n\n\u00a7 232.116(2), the child has been integrated in a pre-adoptive and suitable foster\n\nhome. \u201cIt is well-settled law that we cannot deprive a child of permanency after\n\nthe State has proved a ground for termination under section 232.116(1) by hoping\n\nsomeday a parent will learn to be a parent and be able to provide a stable home\n\f                                          13\n\nfor the child.\u201d In re A.B., 815 N.W.2d 764, 777 (Iowa 2012) (citation omitted). We\n\nconclude termination of the father\u2019s rights is in the child\u2019s best interests.

Therefore, grounds for termination exist pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 232.116(1)(h). On our de novo review, we conclude the father did not carry\n\nhis burden to show the father-child bond was such that termination of his parental\n\nrights would be detrimental to the child; rather, termination of parental rights and\n\nadoption will best provide for the child\u2019s safety; long-term nurturing and growth;\n\nand physical, mental, and emotional condition and needs. We therefore affirm.\n\n       I. Background Facts.\n\n       The child tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine at birth and\n\nwas in the mother\u2019s custody and care for only four days before voluntarily being\n\nplaced in foster care. The department of human services (DHS) became involved.\n\nThe mother reported the father was not taking his prescribed mental-health\n\nmedication and expressed fear of him because he was abusive. DHS helped the\n\nmother move to a domestic-violence shelter. However, after less than two weeks,\n\n\n\n\n1 The mother\u2019s rights were also terminated. She did not appeal.\n2 At the time of the termination hearing, D.M. had been out of parental custody for\ntwenty-five months. The statutory period is \u201cat least six months of the last twelve\nmonths, or for the last six consecutive months and any trial period at home has\nbeen less than thirty days.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(1)(h)(3) (2021).\n\f                                          3\n\n\nthe mother left the shelter, and DHS did not hear from her for several weeks. The\n\nfather was arrested on assault charges.\n\n       On April 10, the State filed a CINA petition. A May 7 hearing on the petition\n\nwas continued because the father was hospitalized after a suicide attempt.\n\n       The child was adjudicated CINA on June 4, 2019. Pending the disposition\n\nhearing, the father was ordered to participate in Family Safety, Risk, and\n\nPermanency (FSRP) services; complete mental-health and substance-abuse\n\nevaluations and follow through with recommended treatment; and sign all\n\nnecessary releases requested by DHS and service providers. On June 18, the\n\ncourt entered an ex parte removal order, placing the child in DHS\u2019s custody and\n\nfinding in part:\n\n       [The mother] and [father] have been provided visitation with the\n       children supervised by FSRP. The parents have been cooperative\n       at visitation but are not consistent with their attendance to the visits.\n       Both parents have not confirmed visits timely or have been late to\n       visits on more than one occasion. Both parents agreed to complete\n       substance abuse evaluations. Those evaluations have not yet been\n       completed. [The father] has reported completed drug testing through\n       probation office. [He] was hospitalized for concerns with self-harm\n       and his overall mental health. Since hospitalization [DHS] has not\n       had any contact with [the father] and FSRP expresses that they\n       struggle in making contact with [him].\n\n       The father obtained a mental-health assessment on July 26. The father has\n\nissues of domestic violence, anger control, and self-reported long histories of\n\nsubstance use (marijuana) and multiple significant mental-health diagnoses. The\n\nevaluator recommended the father obtain a psychiatric evaluation and participate\n\nin ongoing individual therapy to deal with severe depression, anxiety, and\n\ndevelopment of appropriate communication skills.\n\f                                         4\n\n\n       On September 10, a dispositional order was filed, which required the father\n\nto comply with services as requested by DHS or providers, cooperate with all\n\nservices as directed in the case permanency plan, obtain a substance-abuse\n\nevaluation and follow through with any recommended treatment, cooperate with\n\nsubstance-abuse aftercare or support programs, cooperate and participate in\n\nrandom drug testing, obtain a mental-health evaluation and follow through with\n\nrecommended treatment, obtain and maintain safe appropriate housing, and\n\nmaintain employment. The court ordered funding for family counseling, mental-\n\nhealth and substance-abuse evaluations and treatment, and drug testing.\n\n       The father attended a counseling session on August 2. However, he did\n\nnot attend an August 19 session because he was again in jail. His next scheduled\n\nappointment was for September 6, but he did not show. He was discharged from\n\ncounseling due to lack of attendance. For the remainder of 2019, the father\u2019s\n\nparticipation in services was minimal and his visits with the child were sporadic.\n\n       A February 25, 2020 report to the court prior to a CINA review hearing noted\n\nthe father had been arrested in mid-January, had not been in contact with DHS,\n\nand had not been provided visits while in jail. When a worker visited the father in\n\njail, she reported he had not been taking his prescribed mental-health medication\n\nwhile incarcerated. The father reported he would be released soon.\n\n       In March, the juvenile court filed a CINA review order continuing the father\u2019s\n\nrequirements he comply and cooperate with DHS services, obtain a substance-\n\nabuse evaluation and follow through with recommendations, cooperate with\n\nrandom drug testing, obtain a mental-health evaluation and follow through with\n\f                                          5\n\n\nrecommended services, obtain housing, obtain and maintain employment\n\nexpectations, cooperate with visitation, and cooperate with paternity testing.\n\n       The father was released from jail in March and contacted DHS to resume\n\nvisits with D.M. However, he did not attend a scheduled meeting with DHS service\n\nworkers.\n\n       An April 14 FSRP report observed:\n\n               Cognitive: [The father] is not aligned with the needs of [the\n       child]. [The father] does not possess adequate knowledge to fulfill\n       his caregiving responsibilities. [He] is not reality oriented. [The\n       father] stated he did not attend interactions with [the child] for fear\n       that he would be arrested.\n               Behavioral: [The father] is not physically able to provide care\n       to [the child] at this time due to being incarcerated. [The father] does\n       not demonstrate impulse control as he has continued to engage in\n       illegal activities. [The father] does not set aside his needs for [the\n       child].\n               Emotional: [The father] displays concern for [the child]. [The\n       father] does express love toward [the child]. [The father] is not\n       bonded to [the child] due to his limited contact with him.\n\n       In a June 2 DHS report to the court in anticipation of a permanency hearing,\n\nthe DHS worker indicated she had reached the father via phone call on April 10,\n\nexplained that visits could not be face-to-face due to COVID-19 and would be by\n\nvideo, and shared with the father he needed to follow through with paternity testing\n\nand psychiatric testing. Further attempts to contact the father were unsuccessful.\n\nThe worker recommended the permanency goal be changed to termination of\n\nparental rights and the father \u201ccomplete a comprehensive and thorough psychiatric\n\nevaluation with approved court ordered funding and follow through with the\n\nrecommendations.\u201d\n\f                                        6\n\n\n      In an addendum to her earlier report, the DHS worker noted the father\u2019s\n\npaternity had been confirmed. The worker also noted she had met with the father\n\non June 18:\n\n      At that time it was addressed that he needed to complete psychiatric\n      testing with Pat Ewing. [The father] reported that he was currently\n      participating in counseling at Counseling Associates and received\n      medication management through his primary care provider. [The\n      father] was asked that he attend drug testing along with paternity\n      testing. [The father] agreed that he would be able to make\n      arrangements for drug testing if given a call the day of testing but\n      shared if he had to leave the county then he would need approval\n      from his [probation officer (PO)]. This worker let him know that\n      worker would speak with his PO for approval for this. Arrangements\n      were also made for visitation between [the father] and [the child]. It\n      was agreed [the father] would have one visit weekly and if he could\n      show consistency in these visits they would be increased. [FSRP\n      provider] scheduled a visit with [the child] and [the father] for the\n      following week.\n              [The father] was attempted to be reached by phone and then\n      sent a text message on [July 8] that he needed to attend drug testing\n      [July 10]. [The father] was informed that worker had spoken with his\n      PO and that he would be able to leave the county for this. [The\n      father] texted on [July 9] sharing that he needed more of a heads up\n      for testing as he was busy and would not be able to make it. This\n      worker explained through text that it is random drug testing and he\n      was given [two] days advanced notice. [The father] did not attend\n      this testing or respond to workers message.\n              [The father] was sent for drug testing again on [July 17]. He\n      did attend this and hair stat testing was completed. Hair stat test\n      results were received on [August 5] and these were positive for THC.\n      In prior conversations with [the father] he had maintained that he has\n      been sober since last year.\n\n      Further, the report noted the DHS worker had contacted Counseling\n\nAssociates\u2014the father was not involved in counseling between November 2019\n\nand May 2020, was seen once in June, and did not show in July. Pat Ewing was\n\nalso contacted and reported receiving a message from the father weeks before\n\nabout scheduling a psychiatric evaluation. However, Ewing\u2019s attempts to reach\n\nthe father to do set the appointment were unsuccessful. With respect to visits, the\n\f                                         7\n\n\naddendum noted the father was inconsistent with visits and the child was hesitant\n\nto go to the father.\n\n       After a September permanency review hearing, the court found:\n\n               That since the time of the last hearing, there has been a\n       continued lack of progress in regards to completion and participation\n       in court-ordered services by both the parents. Very limited contact\n       with [the father] and he has not been involved or communicated with\n       the worker in regards to making arrangement for services and\n       visitation.\n\nHowever, the mother had made some progress and the court granted an additional\n\nsix months \u201cat which time the court shall hold a hearing to consider modification of\n\nits permanency order.\u201d\n\n       In a January 20, 2021 progress report by FSRP (now known as Family-\n\nCentered Services or FCS), the worker noted the child was well-bonded with the\n\nfoster family and the father was \u201ctrying to get a medical card for THC still\u201d and\n\n\u201cwaiting for funding for his mental health evaluation.\u201d3 The father indicated he had\n\n\u201cvarious mental health diagnoses,\u201d and reported \u201cthe only issue regarding his\n\nportion of the case was the THC.\u201d\n\n       A February 14, progress report states, in part:\n\n       [The father] has reported that he does not use illegal substances\n       except THC. He said that he is in the process of trying to get a\n       medical marijuana card. He takes daily medication. Evaluations\n       have not been done yet by [the father]. He is in the process of getting\n       his birth certificate for more stable employment.\n\n       At a March 9 permanency review hearing, the State indicated an intent to\n\nfile a petition to terminate parental rights. The parties agreed to combine the\n\n\n\n3It is unclear why the earlier court orders were not sufficient to ensure funding was\navailable.\n\f                                           8\n\n\npermanency-review and termination hearings, which would be scheduled after the\n\ntermination petition was filed.\n\n         FCS filed its April 14 progress report, stating, \u201c[The father] reports that he\n\nhas not set up his evaluations set up yet. Options were discussed for options for\n\npsychiatrists. He reports that he will set them up. He reports no use of illegal\n\nsubstances and that he is working regularly.\u201d Visits between father and child were\n\nfully supervised once a week for two hours, having recently been extended by one-\n\nhalf hour.\n\n         On April 27, DHS submitted a report to court for purposes of the combined\n\nhearings, noting the father had obtained housing on March 9 and was more\n\nconsistent with visits. However, the father had not followed through with routine\n\ncounseling over the course of the case, still had not obtained a psychiatric\n\nevaluation, and was not taking his prescribed mental-health medications.\n\nMoreover, although a March 2021 substance-abuse evaluation did not recommend\n\ntreatment, it was because the father \u201cmade it clear he did not intend on stopping\n\nhis use of marijuana and that he was in hopes of obtaining a medical marijuana\n\ncard.\u201d\n\n         During the combined permanency and termination hearing held on April 27,\n\nevidence was presented the father had been in jail several times (each stay\n\nranging from a week to three months). The court found the father had made some\n\n\u201climited progress\u201d since the March 9 hearing, however, the court noted that to\n\nreturn the child to the father would likely subject the child to adjudicatory harm;\n\n\u201cThe child\u2019s father . . . is habitually in and out of incarceration and cannot care for\n\nthe child while incarcerated. With the exception of approximately the last month,\n\f                                         9\n\n\n[the father] participates very minimally in services and there remain serious\n\nconcerns regarding his future drug use and mental health.\u201d The court observed\n\nthe father\u2019s frequent stays in jail \u201ccreat[e] a hectic and unstable environment that\n\nwould not allow for proper or safe care of the child.\u201d The court concluded,\n\n       While the court applauds [the father\u2019s] very recent efforts, they are\n       simply too little too late and are not enough to show a stable and\n       consistent ability to properly care and provide for the mental,\n       emotional, physical, and developmental needs of the child. He has\n       not sufficiently addressed his mental health needs nor sufficiently\n       addressed his substance abuse needs.\n\n       The court noted there was a \u201cconnection\u201d between father and child but the\n\nchild had a \u201cvery strong bond with his current foster parents,\u201d with whom he had\n\nbeen placed for seventeen months. The court found the foster parents were willing\n\nto adopt the child and provide a permanent home where the child\u2019s physical,\n\ndevelopmental, psychological, and emotional needs would be met. Thus, the\n\nchild\u2019s best interests would be served by terminating parental rights.\n\n       The father appeals.\n\n       II. Scope and Standard of Review.\n\n       Review of all termination proceedings is de novo. In re P.L., 778 N.W.2d\n\n33, 40 (Iowa 2010). Under de novo review, \u201c[w]e review both the facts and the law\n\nand adjudicate rights anew on the issues properly presented.\u201d In re A.T., 799\n\nN.W.2d 148, 150\u201351 (Iowa Ct. App. 2011). \u201cWe give weight to the juvenile court\u2019s\n\nfindings, but are not bound by them. Our paramount concern is the child\u2019s best\n\ninterests.\u201d Id. at 151.\n\n       III. Discussion.\n\f                                          10\n\n\n        The father concedes all but the fourth element of Iowa Code section\n\n232.116(1)(h) are established.4 He argues there is not clear and convincing\n\nevidence the child could not be returned to him at the time of the termination\n\nhearing because he had a house DHS found suitable for a child, he was employed,\n\nthere were no concerns mentioned by caseworkers about his parenting ability\n\nduring visits, and there is no evidence his mental health affects his ability to parent.\n\nHe also notes he had a clean drug screen in the spring of 2021 and his substance-\n\nabuse evaluation recommended no treatment.\n\n        Like the district court, we applaud the father\u2019s very recent efforts toward\n\nhousing and job stability. However, we are concerned those efforts did not begin\n\nuntil March 2021 when the child has been out of parental custody since March\n\n2019.    See In re C.B., 611 N.W.2d 489, 495 (Iowa 2000) (\u201cInsight for the\n\ndetermination of the child\u2019s long-range best interests can be gleaned from\n\n\u2018evidence of the parent\u2019s past performance for that performance may be indicative\n\nof the quality of the future care that parent is capable of providing.\u2019\u201d (citation\n\nomitted)). The father has still not adequately addressed his domestic-violence and\n\n\n4 Section 232.116(1)(h) allows the court to terminate parental rights if all of the\nfollowing have occurred:\n                (1) The child is three years of age or younger.\n                (2) The child has been adjudicated a [CINA] pursuant to\n        section 232.96.\n                (3) The child has been removed from the physical custody of\n        the child\u2019s parents for at least six months of the last twelve months,\n        or for the last six consecutive months and any trial period at home\n        has been less than thirty days.\n                (4) There is clear and convincing evidence that the child\n        cannot be returned to the custody of the child\u2019s parents . . . at the\n        present time.\n\u201c[A]t the present time\u201d means at the time of the termination hearing. See In re\nA.M., 843 N.W.2d 100, 111 (Iowa 2014).\n\f                                          11\n\n\nmental-health issues. He has not obtained a psychiatric evaluation\u2014which was\n\nrecommended multiple times since July 2019. The father has been court-ordered\n\nto follow such recommendations since the child was adjudicated a CINA. The\n\nfather minimizes these concerns, but we cannot. He reported to the mental-health\n\nevaluator that he was negatively affected by domestic violence and child abuse in\n\nhis childhood home. He noted he suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which\n\ninduces flashbacks. He reported feelings of anxiety and depression and has been\n\nhospitalized because he was suicidal. He is prescribed medications to address\n\nthese concerns and was urged to participate in ongoing individual therapy. He has\n\nnot followed through with those recommendations and self-medicates with\n\nmarijuana.\n\n       We are not persuaded he can provide a child\u2014or himself\u2014emotional or\n\nphysical stability and security. He also minimizes the effect his several stays in jail\n\nhave had on his child\u2019s life. Even if two of the charges were dismissed after a time,\n\nhe has been convicted of domestic-abuse assault, and his absences while\n\navoiding arrest and in jail have necessarily kept him unavailable for services,\n\nunable to parent, and missing the opportunity for parent-child bonding.           The\n\nfather\u2019s ability to attend to a child for two hours once a week while fully supervised\n\ndoes not carry much weight in the balance. \u201cParenting cannot be turned off and\n\non like a spigot. It must be constant, responsible, and reliable.\u201d In re T.J.O., 527\n\nN.W.2d 417, 422 (Iowa Ct. App. 1994). We conclude there is clear and convincing\n\nevidence the child could not be safely returned to the father\u2019s care at the time of\n\nthe termination hearing.\n\f                                          12\n\n\n       The father next asserts termination is not appropriate due to the closeness\n\nof his bond with the child. Iowa Code section 232.116(3)(c) allows the juvenile\n\ncourt to avoid termination if \u201c[t]here is clear and convincing evidence that the\n\ntermination would be detrimental to the child at the time due to the closeness of\n\nthe parent-child relationship.\u201d We note the application of the statutory exception\n\nto termination is \u201cpermissive, not mandatory.\u201d A.M., 843 N.W.2d at 113. The\n\njuvenile court found there was a \u201cconnection\u201d between father and child but a\n\n\u201cstrong bond\u201d between child and foster parents. We find the evidence of the\n\nfather\u2019s connection insufficient to show \u201ctermination would be detrimental to the\n\nchild . . . due to the closeness of the parent-child relationship\u201d See In re A.S., 906\n\nN.W.2d 467, 476 (Iowa 2018) (noting the parent resisting termination bears the\n\nburden to establish an exception to termination).\n\n       Finally, the father asserts termination is not in the child\u2019s best interests. This\n\nchild has been out of parental custody for all but four days of the child\u2019s life and for\n\nfar more than the statutory period. The statutory period has been far exceeded\n\nhere, and we must view the situation with a sense of urgency. See C.B., 611\n\nN.W.2d at 495.\n\n       Giving \u201cprimary consideration to the child\u2019s safety, to the best placement for\n\nfurthering the long-term nurturing and growth of the child, and to the physical,\n\nmental, and emotional condition and needs of the child,\u201d see Iowa Code\n\n\u00a7 232.116(2), the child has been integrated in a pre-adoptive and suitable foster\n\nhome. \u201cIt is well-settled law that we cannot deprive a child of permanency after\n\nthe State has proved a ground for termination under section 232.116(1) by hoping\n\nsomeday a parent will learn to be a parent and be able to provide a stable home\n\f                                          13\n\nfor the child.\u201d In re A.B., 815 N.W.2d 764, 777 (Iowa 2012) (citation omitted).

Therefore, grounds for termination exist pursuant to Iowa Code\n\nsection 232.116(1)(h). On our de novo review, we conclude the father did not carry\n\nhis burden to show the father-child bond was such that termination of his parental\n\nrights would be detrimental to the child; rather, termination of parental rights and\n\nadoption will best provide for the child\u2019s safety; long-term nurturing and growth;\n\nand physical, mental, and emotional condition and needs. We therefore affirm.\n\n       I. Background Facts.\n\n       The child tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine at birth and\n\nwas in the mother\u2019s custody and care for only four days before voluntarily being\n\nplaced in foster care. The department of human services (DHS) became involved.\n\nThe mother reported the father was not taking his prescribed mental-health\n\nmedication and expressed fear of him because he was abusive. DHS helped the\n\nmother move to a domestic-violence shelter. However, after less than two weeks,\n\n\n\n\n1 The mother\u2019s rights were also terminated. She did not appeal.\n2 At the time of the termination hearing, D.M. had been out of parental custody for\ntwenty-five months. The statutory period is \u201cat least six months of the last twelve\nmonths, or for the last six consecutive months and any trial period at home has\nbeen less than thirty days.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(1)(h)(3) (2021).\n\f                                          3\n\n\nthe mother left the shelter, and DHS did not hear from her for several weeks. The\n\nfather was arrested on assault charges.\n\n       On April 10, the State filed a CINA petition. A May 7 hearing on the petition\n\nwas continued because the father was hospitalized after a suicide attempt.\n\n       The child was adjudicated CINA on June 4, 2019. Pending the disposition\n\nhearing, the father was ordered to participate in Family Safety, Risk, and\n\nPermanency (FSRP) services; complete mental-health and substance-abuse\n\nevaluations and follow through with recommended treatment; and sign all\n\nnecessary releases requested by DHS and service providers. On June 18, the\n\ncourt entered an ex parte removal order, placing the child in DHS\u2019s custody and\n\nfinding in part:\n\n       [The mother] and [father] have been provided visitation with the\n       children supervised by FSRP. The parents have been cooperative\n       at visitation but are not consistent with their attendance to the visits.\n       Both parents have not confirmed visits timely or have been late to\n       visits on more than one occasion. Both parents agreed to complete\n       substance abuse evaluations. Those evaluations have not yet been\n       completed. [The father] has reported completed drug testing through\n       probation office. [He] was hospitalized for concerns with self-harm\n       and his overall mental health. Since hospitalization [DHS] has not\n       had any contact with [the father] and FSRP expresses that they\n       struggle in making contact with [him].\n\n       The father obtained a mental-health assessment on July 26. The father has\n\nissues of domestic violence, anger control, and self-reported long histories of\n\nsubstance use (marijuana) and multiple significant mental-health diagnoses. The\n\nevaluator recommended the father obtain a psychiatric evaluation and participate\n\nin ongoing individual therapy to deal with severe depression, anxiety, and\n\ndevelopment of appropriate communication skills.\n\f                                         4\n\n\n       On September 10, a dispositional order was filed, which required the father\n\nto comply with services as requested by DHS or providers, cooperate with all\n\nservices as directed in the case permanency plan, obtain a substance-abuse\n\nevaluation and follow through with any recommended treatment, cooperate with\n\nsubstance-abuse aftercare or support programs, cooperate and participate in\n\nrandom drug testing, obtain a mental-health evaluation and follow through with\n\nrecommended treatment, obtain and maintain safe appropriate housing, and\n\nmaintain employment. The court ordered funding for family counseling, mental-\n\nhealth and substance-abuse evaluations and treatment, and drug testing.\n\n       The father attended a counseling session on August 2. However, he did\n\nnot attend an August 19 session because he was again in jail. His next scheduled\n\nappointment was for September 6, but he did not show. He was discharged from\n\ncounseling due to lack of attendance. For the remainder of 2019, the father\u2019s\n\nparticipation in services was minimal and his visits with the child were sporadic.\n\n       A February 25, 2020 report to the court prior to a CINA review hearing noted\n\nthe father had been arrested in mid-January, had not been in contact with DHS,\n\nand had not been provided visits while in jail. When a worker visited the father in\n\njail, she reported he had not been taking his prescribed mental-health medication\n\nwhile incarcerated. The father reported he would be released soon.\n\n       In March, the juvenile court filed a CINA review order continuing the father\u2019s\n\nrequirements he comply and cooperate with DHS services, obtain a substance-\n\nabuse evaluation and follow through with recommendations, cooperate with\n\nrandom drug testing, obtain a mental-health evaluation and follow through with\n\f                                          5\n\n\nrecommended services, obtain housing, obtain and maintain employment\n\nexpectations, cooperate with visitation, and cooperate with paternity testing.\n\n       The father was released from jail in March and contacted DHS to resume\n\nvisits with D.M. However, he did not attend a scheduled meeting with DHS service\n\nworkers.\n\n       An April 14 FSRP report observed:\n\n               Cognitive: [The father] is not aligned with the needs of [the\n       child]. [The father] does not possess adequate knowledge to fulfill\n       his caregiving responsibilities. [He] is not reality oriented. [The\n       father] stated he did not attend interactions with [the child] for fear\n       that he would be arrested.\n               Behavioral: [The father] is not physically able to provide care\n       to [the child] at this time due to being incarcerated. [The father] does\n       not demonstrate impulse control as he has continued to engage in\n       illegal activities. [The father] does not set aside his needs for [the\n       child].\n               Emotional: [The father] displays concern for [the child]. [The\n       father] does express love toward [the child]. [The father] is not\n       bonded to [the child] due to his limited contact with him.\n\n       In a June 2 DHS report to the court in anticipation of a permanency hearing,\n\nthe DHS worker indicated she had reached the father via phone call on April 10,\n\nexplained that visits could not be face-to-face due to COVID-19 and would be by\n\nvideo, and shared with the father he needed to follow through with paternity testing\n\nand psychiatric testing. Further attempts to contact the father were unsuccessful.\n\nThe worker recommended the permanency goal be changed to termination of\n\nparental rights and the father \u201ccomplete a comprehensive and thorough psychiatric\n\nevaluation with approved court ordered funding and follow through with the\n\nrecommendations.\u201d\n\f                                        6\n\n\n      In an addendum to her earlier report, the DHS worker noted the father\u2019s\n\npaternity had been confirmed. The worker also noted she had met with the father\n\non June 18:\n\n      At that time it was addressed that he needed to complete psychiatric\n      testing with Pat Ewing. [The father] reported that he was currently\n      participating in counseling at Counseling Associates and received\n      medication management through his primary care provider. [The\n      father] was asked that he attend drug testing along with paternity\n      testing. [The father] agreed that he would be able to make\n      arrangements for drug testing if given a call the day of testing but\n      shared if he had to leave the county then he would need approval\n      from his [probation officer (PO)]. This worker let him know that\n      worker would speak with his PO for approval for this. Arrangements\n      were also made for visitation between [the father] and [the child]. It\n      was agreed [the father] would have one visit weekly and if he could\n      show consistency in these visits they would be increased. [FSRP\n      provider] scheduled a visit with [the child] and [the father] for the\n      following week.\n              [The father] was attempted to be reached by phone and then\n      sent a text message on [July 8] that he needed to attend drug testing\n      [July 10]. [The father] was informed that worker had spoken with his\n      PO and that he would be able to leave the county for this. [The\n      father] texted on [July 9] sharing that he needed more of a heads up\n      for testing as he was busy and would not be able to make it. This\n      worker explained through text that it is random drug testing and he\n      was given [two] days advanced notice. [The father] did not attend\n      this testing or respond to workers message.\n              [The father] was sent for drug testing again on [July 17]. He\n      did attend this and hair stat testing was completed. Hair stat test\n      results were received on [August 5] and these were positive for THC.\n      In prior conversations with [the father] he had maintained that he has\n      been sober since last year.\n\n      Further, the report noted the DHS worker had contacted Counseling\n\nAssociates\u2014the father was not involved in counseling between November 2019\n\nand May 2020, was seen once in June, and did not show in July. Pat Ewing was\n\nalso contacted and reported receiving a message from the father weeks before\n\nabout scheduling a psychiatric evaluation. However, Ewing\u2019s attempts to reach\n\nthe father to do set the appointment were unsuccessful. With respect to visits, the\n\f                                         7\n\n\naddendum noted the father was inconsistent with visits and the child was hesitant\n\nto go to the father.\n\n       After a September permanency review hearing, the court found:\n\n               That since the time of the last hearing, there has been a\n       continued lack of progress in regards to completion and participation\n       in court-ordered services by both the parents. Very limited contact\n       with [the father] and he has not been involved or communicated with\n       the worker in regards to making arrangement for services and\n       visitation.\n\nHowever, the mother had made some progress and the court granted an additional\n\nsix months \u201cat which time the court shall hold a hearing to consider modification of\n\nits permanency order.\u201d\n\n       In a January 20, 2021 progress report by FSRP (now known as Family-\n\nCentered Services or FCS), the worker noted the child was well-bonded with the\n\nfoster family and the father was \u201ctrying to get a medical card for THC still\u201d and\n\n\u201cwaiting for funding for his mental health evaluation.\u201d3 The father indicated he had\n\n\u201cvarious mental health diagnoses,\u201d and reported \u201cthe only issue regarding his\n\nportion of the case was the THC.\u201d\n\n       A February 14, progress report states, in part:\n\n       [The father] has reported that he does not use illegal substances\n       except THC. He said that he is in the process of trying to get a\n       medical marijuana card. He takes daily medication. Evaluations\n       have not been done yet by [the father]. He is in the process of getting\n       his birth certificate for more stable employment.\n\n       At a March 9 permanency review hearing, the State indicated an intent to\n\nfile a petition to terminate parental rights. The parties agreed to combine the\n\n\n\n3It is unclear why the earlier court orders were not sufficient to ensure funding was\navailable.\n\f                                           8\n\n\npermanency-review and termination hearings, which would be scheduled after the\n\ntermination petition was filed.\n\n         FCS filed its April 14 progress report, stating, \u201c[The father] reports that he\n\nhas not set up his evaluations set up yet. Options were discussed for options for\n\npsychiatrists. He reports that he will set them up. He reports no use of illegal\n\nsubstances and that he is working regularly.\u201d Visits between father and child were\n\nfully supervised once a week for two hours, having recently been extended by one-\n\nhalf hour.\n\n         On April 27, DHS submitted a report to court for purposes of the combined\n\nhearings, noting the father had obtained housing on March 9 and was more\n\nconsistent with visits. However, the father had not followed through with routine\n\ncounseling over the course of the case, still had not obtained a psychiatric\n\nevaluation, and was not taking his prescribed mental-health medications.\n\nMoreover, although a March 2021 substance-abuse evaluation did not recommend\n\ntreatment, it was because the father \u201cmade it clear he did not intend on stopping\n\nhis use of marijuana and that he was in hopes of obtaining a medical marijuana\n\ncard.\u201d\n\n         During the combined permanency and termination hearing held on April 27,\n\nevidence was presented the father had been in jail several times (each stay\n\nranging from a week to three months). The court found the father had made some\n\n\u201climited progress\u201d since the March 9 hearing, however, the court noted that to\n\nreturn the child to the father would likely subject the child to adjudicatory harm;\n\n\u201cThe child\u2019s father . . . is habitually in and out of incarceration and cannot care for\n\nthe child while incarcerated. With the exception of approximately the last month,\n\f                                         9\n\n\n[the father] participates very minimally in services and there remain serious\n\nconcerns regarding his future drug use and mental health.\u201d The court observed\n\nthe father\u2019s frequent stays in jail \u201ccreat[e] a hectic and unstable environment that\n\nwould not allow for proper or safe care of the child.\u201d The court concluded,\n\n       While the court applauds [the father\u2019s] very recent efforts, they are\n       simply too little too late and are not enough to show a stable and\n       consistent ability to properly care and provide for the mental,\n       emotional, physical, and developmental needs of the child. He has\n       not sufficiently addressed his mental health needs nor sufficiently\n       addressed his substance abuse needs.\n\n       The court noted there was a \u201cconnection\u201d between father and child but the\n\nchild had a \u201cvery strong bond with his current foster parents,\u201d with whom he had\n\nbeen placed for seventeen months. The court found the foster parents were willing\n\nto adopt the child and provide a permanent home where the child\u2019s physical,\n\ndevelopmental, psychological, and emotional needs would be met. Thus, the\n\nchild\u2019s best interests would be served by terminating parental rights.\n\n       The father appeals.\n\n       II.

Discussion.\n\f                                          10\n\n\n        The father concedes all but the fourth element of Iowa Code section\n\n232.116(1)(h) are established.4 He argues there is not clear and convincing\n\nevidence the child could not be returned to him at the time of the termination\n\nhearing because he had a house DHS found suitable for a child, he was employed,\n\nthere were no concerns mentioned by caseworkers about his parenting ability\n\nduring visits, and there is no evidence his mental health affects his ability to parent.\n\nHe also notes he had a clean drug screen in the spring of 2021 and his substance-\n\nabuse evaluation recommended no treatment.\n\n        Like the district court, we applaud the father\u2019s very recent efforts toward\n\nhousing and job stability. However, we are concerned those efforts did not begin\n\nuntil March 2021 when the child has been out of parental custody since March\n\n2019.    See In re C.B., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2168880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2168880/in-re-cb/\">611 N.W.2d 489</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (Iowa 2000) (\u201cInsight for the\n\ndetermination of the child\u2019s long-range best interests can be gleaned from\n\n\u2018evidence of the parent\u2019s past performance for that performance may be indicative\n\nof the quality of the future care that parent is capable of providing.\u2019\u201d (citation\n\nomitted)).

He has not obtained a psychiatric evaluation\u2014which was\n\nrecommended multiple times since July 2019. The father has been court-ordered\n\nto follow such recommendations since the child was adjudicated a CINA. The\n\nfather minimizes these concerns, but we cannot. He reported to the mental-health\n\nevaluator that he was negatively affected by domestic violence and child abuse in\n\nhis childhood home. He noted he suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which\n\ninduces flashbacks. He reported feelings of anxiety and depression and has been\n\nhospitalized because he was suicidal. He is prescribed medications to address\n\nthese concerns and was urged to participate in ongoing individual therapy. He has\n\nnot followed through with those recommendations and self-medicates with\n\nmarijuana.\n\n       We are not persuaded he can provide a child\u2014or himself\u2014emotional or\n\nphysical stability and security. He also minimizes the effect his several stays in jail\n\nhave had on his child\u2019s life. Even if two of the charges were dismissed after a time,\n\nhe has been convicted of domestic-abuse assault, and his absences while\n\navoiding arrest and in jail have necessarily kept him unavailable for services,\n\nunable to parent, and missing the opportunity for parent-child bonding.           The\n\nfather\u2019s ability to attend to a child for two hours once a week while fully supervised\n\ndoes not carry much weight in the balance. \u201cParenting cannot be turned off and\n\non like a spigot.

The employer submitted a First Report of Injury form identifying New Hampshire Insurance Company as its carrier and Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc. as the claim administrator. Claimant's workers' compensation claim was established for injury to his neck, and awards were made at a temporary total disability rate. The claim was subsequently amended to include posttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorder with anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>Thereafter, further proceedings were conducted with respect to the permanency of claimant's condition. Claimant submitted an application for review by the Workers' Compensation Board of a decision of a Workers' Compensation Law Judge (hereinafter WCLJ) that directed claimant demonstrate labor market attachment, which claimant served on Sedgwick but not on New Hampshire Insurance Company. No challenge to the service issue was raised in the rebuttal application. The Board held in abeyance the WCLJ's directive that claimant produce evidence of labor market attachment, pending development of the record and resolution of the degree of disability.</p>\r\n<p>Following further proceedings, the WCLJ, by decision filed March 26, 2020, classified claimant with a permanent partial disability and a 90% loss of wage-earning capacity. Claimant filed an application for Board review of that decision, again serving Sedgwick but not New Hampshire Insurance Company. No rebuttal to that application was filed. By decision filed June 16, 2020, the Board found that claimant did not comply with the requirements of 12 NYCRR 300.13 (b) in that he failed to serve New Hampshire Insurance Company, a party in interest, and exercised its discretion to deny review of the WCLJ's decision. The Board, by decision filed August 17, 2020, denied claimant's subsequent application for reconsideration and/or full Board review. Claimant appeals from both Board decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Claimant contends that the Board erred in denying his application for Board review because New Hampshire Insurance Company and its counsel have held Sedgwick out as the proper entity to be served in this matter. An application for Board review of a WCLJ decision \"shall be filed with the [B]oard within 30 days after the notice of the filing of the [WCLJ] decision\" (12 NYCRR 300.13 [b] [3] [i]) and must \"include proof of service upon all necessary parties of interest\" (12 NYCRR 300.13 [b] [2] [iv]). Necessary parties [*2]of interest are defined as \"claimants, self-insured employers, private insurance carriers, the state insurance fund, special funds, no-fault carriers per [Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 142], or any surety, including but not limited to the uninsured employer's fund, and the liquidation bureau\" (12 NYCRR 300.13 [a] [4]). The regulation further provides that the \"[f]ailure to properly serve a necessary party shall be deemed defective service and the application may be rejected by the Board\" (12 NYCRR 300.13 [b] [2] [iv]).</p>\r\n<p>The application for Board review was served on Sedgwick and counsel for New Hampshire Insurance Company, but not on New Hampshire Insurance Company itself. From the initial stages of this matter, Sedgwick was clearly identified as the administrator handling the claim on behalf of New Hampshire Insurance Company. An administrator, however, \"does not stand in the shoes of the carrier or constitute a necessary party of interest\" (<i>Matter of Morgan v DR2 &amp; Co. LLC</i>, 189 AD3d 1828, 1830 [2020]). It is the carrier itself that is the real party of interest (<i>see Matter of Wilson v Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron</i>, 2 AD3d 1004, 1005 [2003]). Although the record reflects that forms throughout this matter listed Sedgwick as the carrier or the entity to which notice should be sent, \"this does not obviate the regulatory requirement that the carrier be served with the application for Board review\" (<i>Matter of Morgan v DR2 &amp; Co. LLC</i>, 189 AD3d at 1830). There is no dispute that the application for Board review was not served on New Hampshire Insurance Company. As claimant did not comply with the regulatory service requirements (<i>see</i> 12 NYCRR 300.13 [a] [4]; [b] [2] [iv]), we find no abuse of discretion in the Board denying review of the WCLJ decision (<i>see Matter of Morgan v DR2 &amp; Co. LLC</i>, at 1830-1831).</p>\r\n<p>Further, we discern no basis upon which to conclude that the Board abused its discretion or acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in denying claimant's request for reconsideration and/or full Board review (<i>see Matter of You Cai Zhang v Tony's Marble &amp; Granite Supply Corp.</i>, 95 AD3d 1510, 1511 [2012]). To the extent that claimant requests that the Board's decisions be reversed and his application for Board review be considered in the interest of justice, we note that it is within the power and jurisdiction of the Board, not this Court, to \"make such modification or change with respect to former findings, awards, decisions or orders relating thereto, as in its opinion may be just\" (Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 123; <i>see</i> 12 NYCRR 300.14 [a] [3]).</p>\r\n<p>Garry, P.J., Egan Jr., Pritzker and Colangelo, JJ., concur.</p>\r\n<p>ORDERED that the decisions are affirmed, without costs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<div>\r\n\r\nMatter of Barry v Verizon N.Y.

Because the record shows L.C.\u2019s safety and\n\nemotional needs are best served by ending her legal tie to William, we affirm.2\n\n        Methamphetamine use by her parents and domestic violence perpetrated\n\nby William led to the voluntary removal of L.C. from her home in June 2019.3 The\n\nState charged the parents with child endangerment and drug possession.\n\nAuthorities extradited William to Nebraska, where he had an outstanding warrant.\n\nAs a result, he was incarcerated for several months at the start of the child-welfare\n\ncase.\n\n        This was not L.C.\u2019s first removal. Nebraska social services placed L.C.\n\noutside her parents\u2019 care for over two years. The issues in that case were the\n\nsame: drug abuse and domestic violence. William faced a felony assault charge\n\nfor severely beating Dixie. L.C. also reported seeing her parents strike each other.\n\nWilliam did not participate in services to address the concerns arising in Nebraska.\n\n\n\n1 Originally, the State also petitioned for the termination of the rights of L.C.\u2019s\nmother, Dixie. But because Dixie had shown significant progress toward\nreunification by the hearing date, the State dismissed the petition against her.\n2 We review de novo the record and the juvenile court\u2019s application of the best-\n\ninterest factors in section 232.116(2). In re P.L., 778 N.W.2d 33, 40 (Iowa 2010)\n(\u201cAlthough the court has to use its best judgment in applying the factors contained\nin the statute, this does not mean we review its decision for an abuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d).\n3 L.C. has been in the same foster home since her removal from parental care.\n\f                                          3\n\n\nEven when reunification occurred between L.C. and Dixie, Nebraska authorities\n\nstill did not consider William to be a safe parent.\n\n        That situation never changed. William\u2019s incarceration and ongoing drug\n\nabuse prevented reunification with L.C. He did complete an inpatient substance-\n\nabuse treatment program in March 2020. Then, because of COVID-19 restrictions,\n\nhis outpatient treatment was by virtual appointments. By the time his provider\n\nstarted offering in-person appointments that summer, William had left the state.\n\nHe moved back to Nebraska and then to Idaho\u2014missing all visitation with L.C.\n\n        The State petitioned for termination of his parental rights in December.\n\nWhen William returned to Iowa in January 2021, he obtained a new substance-\n\nabuse evaluation. He admitted injecting methamphetamine daily, as well as heroin\n\nand marijuana use. Although William re-engaged in treatment, he did not sign a\n\nrelease so that DHS could track his progress.\n\n        William\u2019s commitment to mental-health treatment was also underwhelming.\n\nWilliam reports diagnoses of borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder.        But he engaged in minimal medication\n\nmanagement and did not pursue the recommended therapy.\n\n        In February 2021, William filed a written consent to termination of his\n\nparental rights, asserting, \u201cI am unable to safely care for L.C. at this time or in the\n\nreasonably foreseeable future.\u201d But before the April 2021 termination hearing,\n\nWilliam withdrew his consent. After that hearing, the juvenile court terminated\n\nWilliam\u2019s parental rights, citing Iowa Code section 232.116(1), paragraphs (d), (e),\n\n(f), (k), and (l).\n\f                                            4\n\n\n       The court provided this insightful summary of the reasons for termination:\n\n       William\u2019s relationship with [L.C.] has remained extremely limited, his\n       parenting abilities have not improved significantly in almost two\n       years, and his visits with [L.C.] have not been productive as they\n       have not improved the parent-child relationship between them.\n       Allowing William to remain a part of [L.C.\u2019s] life would be a significant\n       and serious disruption to her life, and would interfere with the plan to\n       reunify [L.C.] with her mother, Dixie.            William\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s\n       relationship is toxic and filled with violent episodes, and the success\n       of the permanency goal of placement of [L.C.] with Dixie would be\n       significantly impaired by maintaining William\u2019s parental rights and his\n       involvement in that placement process.\n\n       William\u2019s petition on appeal does not challenge the statutory grounds. So\n\nwe need not address that step in the termination process. See P.L., 778 N.W.2d\n\nat 40 (describing the three-step process for termination of parental rights). The\n\nonly question is whether termination is in L.C.\u2019s best interests.\n\n       In making that best-interests determination, we \u201cgive primary consideration\n\nto the child\u2019s safety, to the best placement for furthering the long-term nurturing\n\nand growth of the child, and to the physical, mental, and emotional condition and\n\nneeds of the child.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(2); P.L., 778 N.W.2d at 40. That statute\n\nallows us to consider whether a parent\u2019s ability to provide for the needs of the child\n\nis affected by his \u201cmental condition.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(2)(a). And, for a child\n\nplaced in foster care, we may consider \u201cwhether the child has become integrated\n\ninto the foster family to the extent that the child\u2019s familial identity is with the foster\n\nfamily.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(2)(b). In considering integration into a foster family,\n\nwe review both (1) \u201cthe length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory\n\nenvironment and the desirability of maintaining that environment and continuity for\n\nthe child\u201d and (2) \u201cthe reasonable preference of the child, if the court determines\n\f                                          5\n\nthat the child has sufficient capacity to express a reasonable preference.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 232.116(2)(b)(1), (2).\n\n       William argues termination was not in L.C.\u2019s best interests because they\n\nshare a close bond. He asserts the juvenile court relied too heavily on testimony\n\nfrom the case worker in finding a \u201cminimal\u201d parent-child bond. He contends the\n\nworker was \u201cunqualified to make reliable and informed bonding assessments.\u201d\n\nWilliam also contends the court should have considered \u201cthe long-term financial\n\nconsequences\u201d that termination of his rights would have on L.C.\n\n       We disagree with William\u2019s view of the facts, as well as his application of\n\nthe best-interests factors. First, the juvenile court appropriately deferred to the\n\nexpertise of the social worker on the bonding issue. See generally In re A.M., 843\n\nN.W.2d 100, 111 (Iowa 2014) (crediting caseworker\u2019s opinion); In re D.W., 791\n\nN.W.2d 100, 707 (Iowa 2010). Second, the parent-child bond may play a role in\n\nthe best-interests determination, but it is not the only consideration.\n\n       The primary consideration is L.C.\u2019s safety, which cannot be ensured in\n\nWilliam\u2019s care. See In re J.E., 723 N.W.2d 793, 802 (Iowa 2006) (Cady, J.,\n\nconcurring specially) (identifying safety and the need for a permanent home as the\n\n\u201cdefining elements\u201d in the best-interests determination). William has not engaged\n\nin the services necessary to address his parenting deficiencies caused by\n\nsubstance abuse and domestic violence. His unaddressed mental-health issues\n\nalso affect his ability to provide for L.C.\u2019s needs. See Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(2)(a).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the record shows L.C. is comfortable with her foster care family, and\n\nhas also voiced a desire to reunite with Dixie. By contrast, L.C. told the social\n\nworker she enjoyed her visits with William but did not express a desire to return to\n\f                                            6\n\n\nhis custody. Finally, we decline to consider William\u2019s argument that termination is\n\nnot in L.C.\u2019s best interests based on the potential for financial support.

Because the record shows L.C.\u2019s safety and\n\nemotional needs are best served by ending her legal tie to William, we affirm.2\n\n        Methamphetamine use by her parents and domestic violence perpetrated\n\nby William led to the voluntary removal of L.C. from her home in June 2019.3 The\n\nState charged the parents with child endangerment and drug possession.\n\nAuthorities extradited William to Nebraska, where he had an outstanding warrant.\n\nAs a result, he was incarcerated for several months at the start of the child-welfare\n\ncase.\n\n        This was not L.C.\u2019s first removal. Nebraska social services placed L.C.\n\noutside her parents\u2019 care for over two years. The issues in that case were the\n\nsame: drug abuse and domestic violence. William faced a felony assault charge\n\nfor severely beating Dixie. L.C. also reported seeing her parents strike each other.\n\nWilliam did not participate in services to address the concerns arising in Nebraska.\n\n\n\n1 Originally, the State also petitioned for the termination of the rights of L.C.\u2019s\nmother, Dixie. But because Dixie had shown significant progress toward\nreunification by the hearing date, the State dismissed the petition against her.\n2 We review de novo the record and the juvenile court\u2019s application of the best-\n\ninterest factors in section 232.116(2). In re P.L., 778 N.W.2d 33, 40 (Iowa 2010)\n(\u201cAlthough the court has to use its best judgment in applying the factors contained\nin the statute, this does not mean we review its decision for an abuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d).\n3 L.C. has been in the same foster home since her removal from parental care.\n\f                                          3\n\n\nEven when reunification occurred between L.C. and Dixie, Nebraska authorities\n\nstill did not consider William to be a safe parent.\n\n        That situation never changed. William\u2019s incarceration and ongoing drug\n\nabuse prevented reunification with L.C. He did complete an inpatient substance-\n\nabuse treatment program in March 2020. Then, because of COVID-19 restrictions,\n\nhis outpatient treatment was by virtual appointments. By the time his provider\n\nstarted offering in-person appointments that summer, William had left the state.\n\nHe moved back to Nebraska and then to Idaho\u2014missing all visitation with L.C.\n\n        The State petitioned for termination of his parental rights in December.\n\nWhen William returned to Iowa in January 2021, he obtained a new substance-\n\nabuse evaluation. He admitted injecting methamphetamine daily, as well as heroin\n\nand marijuana use. Although William re-engaged in treatment, he did not sign a\n\nrelease so that DHS could track his progress.\n\n        William\u2019s commitment to mental-health treatment was also underwhelming.\n\nWilliam reports diagnoses of borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder.        But he engaged in minimal medication\n\nmanagement and did not pursue the recommended therapy.\n\n        In February 2021, William filed a written consent to termination of his\n\nparental rights, asserting, \u201cI am unable to safely care for L.C. at this time or in the\n\nreasonably foreseeable future.\u201d But before the April 2021 termination hearing,\n\nWilliam withdrew his consent. After that hearing, the juvenile court terminated\n\nWilliam\u2019s parental rights, citing Iowa Code section 232.116(1), paragraphs (d), (e),\n\n(f), (k), and (l).\n\f                                            4\n\n\n       The court provided this insightful summary of the reasons for termination:\n\n       William\u2019s relationship with [L.C.] has remained extremely limited, his\n       parenting abilities have not improved significantly in almost two\n       years, and his visits with [L.C.] have not been productive as they\n       have not improved the parent-child relationship between them.\n       Allowing William to remain a part of [L.C.\u2019s] life would be a significant\n       and serious disruption to her life, and would interfere with the plan to\n       reunify [L.C.] with her mother, Dixie.            William\u2019s and Dixie\u2019s\n       relationship is toxic and filled with violent episodes, and the success\n       of the permanency goal of placement of [L.C.] with Dixie would be\n       significantly impaired by maintaining William\u2019s parental rights and his\n       involvement in that placement process.\n\n       William\u2019s petition on appeal does not challenge the statutory grounds.

See generally In re A.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">843\n\nN.W.2d 100</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (Iowa 2014) (crediting caseworker\u2019s opinion); In re D.W., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">791\n\nN.W.2d 100</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707 (Iowa 2010). Second, the parent-child bond may play a role in\n\nthe best-interests determination, but it is not the only consideration.\n\n       The primary consideration is L.C.\u2019s safety, which cannot be ensured in\n\nWilliam\u2019s care. See In re J.E., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1930851\"><a href=\"/opinion/1930851/in-re-je/\">723 N.W.2d 793</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (Iowa 2006) (Cady, J.,\n\nconcurring specially) (identifying safety and the need for a permanent home as the\n\n\u201cdefining elements\u201d in the best-interests determination). William has not engaged\n\nin the services necessary to address his parenting deficiencies caused by\n\nsubstance abuse and domestic violence. His unaddressed mental-health issues\n\nalso affect his ability to provide for L.C.\u2019s needs. See Iowa Code \u00a7 232.116(2)(a).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the record shows L.C. is comfortable with her foster care family, and\n\nhas also voiced a desire to reunite with Dixie.

INTRODUCTION\n\n     1.       At 15,1 Defendant Kiristen Mays-Robinson stands accused of two\n\ncounts of Robbery First Degree, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of\n\na Felony (PFDCF), Possession, Purchase, Own or Control of a Firearm by a\n\nProhibited Juvenile, Possession of a Weapon with a Removed, Obliterate or Altered\n\nSerial Number, Receiving a Stolen Firearm, Conspiracy Second Degree, and\n\nReceiving Stolen Property Over $1,500.2 It is alleged she committed these offenses\n\nwhen she was 14. She seeks to transfer her charges to Family Court under 10 Del.\n\nC. \u00a7 1011. A reverse amenability hearing was held on August 17, 2021. Upon\n\nconsideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, oral argument, and the record in this case,\n\nDefendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer Charges to Family Court is GRANTED.\n\n                 II.     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 3\n\n     2.       On November 19, 2020, New Castle County Police responded to a\n\nrobbery that had occurred in the area of Lighthouse Road and Haines Avenue in\n\nWilmington. At approximately 5:50 p.m., Norman Seltzer (Victim) had parked his\n\nvehicle in that area. While sitting in his car, Victim observed a black Toyota Prius\n\nenter the intersection, turn around and head in his direction.\n\n\n\n1\n  Defendant\u2019s date of birth is November 28, 2005.\n2\n  Indictment, True Bill Filed No. 41, State of Delaware v. Kiristen Mays-Robinson, Crim. ID No.\n2011008832, D.I. 2 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 26, 2021).\n3\n  This recitation is based upon oral argument and evidence presented at the reverse amenability\nhearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer on August 17, 2021.\n                                               2\n\f     3.     Victim exited his vehicle as the Toyota Prius approached him and\n\nnoticed a black female wearing a surgical mask driving the Prius. The Prius stopped\n\nand he then saw a second black female exit the vehicle from the rear passenger seat.\n\nThat female approached him, pointed a silver handgun, and demanded the keys to\n\nhis car.\n\n     4.     Upon command, Victim dropped his keys, wallet, phone and laptop bag\n\ncontaining a laptop and fled behind a nearby car, and then observed the suspects\n\nretrieved the same. Victim reported the incident to Delaware State Police.\n\n     5.     Soon thereafter, State Police observe a Toyota Prius parked at a gas\n\nstation on Philadelphia Pike in Claymont Delaware. The vehicle had been reported\n\nstolen to police two days prior on November 17. Police stopped the vehicle, and\n\nthree individuals fled from the car. Two of them were eventually located and\n\narrested, including Defendant and Ericka Miller (Miller.)\n\n     6.     During a search incident to arrest, Victim\u2019s cell phone is found in\n\nDefendant\u2019s pocket and a black and silver Smith & Wesson .40 caliber handgun with\n\nan extended magazine and obliterated serial number is found inside the vehicle. The\n\nhandgun was later determined to have been stolen.\n\n     7.     During a post-miranda interview, Defendant admitted to intentionally\n\nrobbing Victim. Defendant also stated she was aware of the handgun in the vehicle,\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fbut claimed she did not possess it, although she did admit to having possessed it\n\npreviously. Defendant also admitted to knowing that the Toyota Prius was stolen.\n\n     8.       Police also conducted a post-miranda interview with Miller who told\n\npolice they had planned to rob Victim and that it was Defendant who used the\n\nhandgun during the robbery.\n\n                             III.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     9.       The reverse amenability process is meant to identify juveniles charges\n\nas adults who are amenable to the rehabilitative process of the Family Court. 4 If the\n\njuvenile files a motion to transfer the adult charges, this Court must hold a reverse\n\namenability hearing and weigh the four factors set forth in 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1011(b).5\n\nThe Court may consider evidence of: (1) \u201c[t]he nature of the present offense and the\n\nextent and nature of the defendant\u2019s prior record, if any;\u201d 6 (2) \u201c[t]he nature of past\n\ntreatment and rehabilitative efforts and the nature of the defendant\u2019s response\n\nthereto, if any;\u201d7 (3) \u201c[w]hether the interests of society and the defendant would be\n\nbest served by trial in the Family Court or in the Superior Court[;]\u201d 8 and (4) any\n\n\u201cother factors which, in the judgment of the Court are deemed relevant.\u201d 9\n\n\n4\n  See generally 10 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1010-11; see also Hughes v. State, 653 A.2d 241, 249 (Del. 1994)\n(quoting Marine v. State, 624 A.2d 1181, 1184 (Del. 1993); Marine v. State, 607 A.2d 1185,\n1209 (Del. 1992)).\n5\n  See, e.g., State v. Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *5-7 (Del. Super. Mar. 31, 2014).\n6\n  10 Del. C. \u00a7 1011(b)(1).\n7\n  Id. at \u00a7 1011(b)(2).\n8\n  Id. at \u00a7 1011(b)(3).\n9\n  Id. at \u00a7 1011(b).\n                                               4\n\f                                    IV.    DISCUSSION\n\n     A. Fair Likelihood of Conviction\n\n      10.     Before weighing the \u00a7 1011(b) factors, \u201cthis Court must preliminarily\n\ndetermine whether the State has made out a prima facie case against the juvenile.\u201d10\n\nThe Court considers \u201cwhether there is a fair likelihood that [the defendant] will be\n\nconvicted of the crimes charged.\u201d11 Furthermore, \u201c[a] real probability must exist\n\nthat a reasonable jury could convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that the\n\nevidence adduced at the reverse amenability hearing stands unrebutted by the\n\ndefendant at trial.\u201d12 Since Defendant was 14 at the time of the alleged offenses, the\n\nCourt need not consider the applicability of 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1447A(f) as to the firearm\n\ncharges.\n\n      11.     As noted at the Reverse Amenability hearing on August 17, as to the\n\nRobbery First Degree and accompanying charges, at this juncture, a reasonable jury\n\ncould convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that State\u2019s evidence stood\n\nunrebutted. Defendant admitted she intended to and did rob Victim along with\n\nMiller. Defendant was aware the .40 caliber handgun was in the vehicle, and while\n\nshe denies using it, Miller told police that it was Defendant who used and displayed\n\nthe gun during the robbery. Defendant also admitted to possessing the firearm in the\n\n\n10\n   Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *5 (citing Marine v. State, 624 A.2d 1181, 1185 (Del. 1993)).\n11\n   Id.\n12\n   Id.\n                                              5\n\fpast. Further, Defendant was also aware and admitted that the Toyota Prius she was\n\nin was a stolen vehicle. After reviewing the totality of the evidence presented, there\n\nis a fair likelihood that Defendant would be convicted of the charged offenses. For\n\nthese reasons and those stated on the record, the State has established its prima facia\n\ncase with a fair likelihood of conviction at trial.\n\n     B. Weighing \u00a7 1011(b)\u2019s Four Factors\n\n      12.      The purpose of \u201cdetermining a juveniles amenability is to place a\n\njudicial check on the prosecutorial charging of juveniles.\u201d13 However, 10 Del. C. \u00a7\n\n1010 states that when a juvenile is charged with the crime of Robbery First Degree\n\nwhere such offense involves the display of what appears to be a deadly weapon,\n\namong others, a child shall be proceeded against as an adult.14 Therefore, \u201csince a\n\njuvenile charged with a designated felony in the Superior Court has lost the benefit\n\nof Family Court adjudication by statutory pronouncement, there is a presumption\n\nthat need exists for adult discipline and legal restraint. Hence, the burden is upon\n\nthe juvenile to demonstrate to the contrary.\u201d15 In considering whether the factors\n\nweigh in favor of transfer, Defendant meets her burden.\n\n\n13\n   Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *4 (citing State v. Anderson, 697 A.2d 379, 383 (Del. 1997)).\n14\n   See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1010(a)(1).\n15\n   Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *4 (quoting Anderson, 385 A.2d at 740) (internal quotations\nomitted); see also State v. Mayhall, 659 A.2d 790, 795 (Del. Super. 1995) (\u201cI also take into\nconsideration the fact that by including second degree murder in those offenses where original\njurisdiction has been conferred on the Superior Court under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1010 the legislature has\ncreated a rebuttable presumption that juveniles charged with that crime should be tried as adults\nand the burden of proof rests with each defendant to rebut that presumption.\u201d).\n                                                6\n\f          1. Section 1011(b) Factor One: Nature of Present Offense and the Extent\n             and Nature of Defendant\u2019s Prior Record\n\n        13.      The first \u00a7 1011(b) factor is two pronged. 16 The charges against\n\nDefendant are violent and serious and weigh against transfer. The second prong also\n\nweighs against transfer. Defendant has previously been adjudicated delinquent for\n\ncharges of Conspiracy, Burglary, and Assault. Defendant then was later adjudicated\n\ndelinquent for violating the conditions of her probation and she picked up charges\n\nfor Receiving Stolen Property soon after. For these reasons, both prongs weigh\n\nagainst transfer.\n\n          2. Section 1011(b) Factor Two: Nature of Past Treatment and\n             Defendant\u2019s Response\n\n        14.      Defendant has never been placed in a Level IV or V facility, but she\n\nhas received services from YRS in the past. Defendant has been placed on GPS\n\nmonitoring on multiple occasions with inconsistent results when it comes to\n\nfollowing guidelines set forth by her probation officer. Defendant was also placed\n\non Pre-Trial Services between October 2019 and July 2020 but was arrested multiple\n\ntimes during that span.\n\n        15.      Defendant was sentenced in July 2020 to community supervision with\n\na YRS probation officer. During that time Defendant received multiple assessments\n\nwhich placed her at low to moderate risks for reoffending. The assessments noted\n\n\n16\n     See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1011(b)(1).\n                                            7\n\fthat Defendant was in most need of treatment for Relationships, Mental Health,\n\nEmployment and Family & Social Support.\n\n     16.        Defendant has spent time in non-secure detention facilities including\n\nVision Quest RAD where overall she did well. While at RAD, Defendant had\n\npositive behaviors and was completing schoolwork. Following her arrest for these\n\ncharges, Defendant has been detained at the New Castle County Detention Center\n\nwhere she has maintained a positive attitude and achieved (lost and regained) gold\n\nshirt status.\n\n     17.        Laura Cooney-Koss, Psy.D. testified on behalf of Defendant. Dr.\n\nCooney-Koss opined that Defendant had been \u201cprofoundly impacted by her history\n\nof sexual abuse\u201d for which she had never been treated. 17 Dr. Cooney-Koss also\n\nstated that Defendant qualified for several psychiatric diagnoses, including\n\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, Attention\n\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Cannabis and\n\nTobacco Use Disorder, and Specific Learning Disorder. 18\n\n     18.        Dr. Cooney-Koss opined it \u201cis imperative that [Defendant] receive\n\nindividual mental health treatment, with a specific focus on her trauma history.\u201d19\n\nDr. Cooney-Koss also noted that while Defendant has received some intervention\n\n\n17\n   Psychological Evaluation by Laura Cooney-Koss, Psy.D., at 20 (June 2, 2021).\n18\n   Id. at 20-21.\n19\n   Id. at 21.\n                                              8\n\ffrom YRS, none of them have been therapeutic interventions which she believes are\n\nmost critical to address Defendant\u2019s needs.\n\n        19.      YRS testified for the State. However, YRS concurred with Dr. Cooney-\n\nKoss that the Department of Services for Children, Youth & their Families\n\n(DSCYF,) and specifically, YRS, could continue to provide services to Defendant\n\nthrough the Family Court. Both Dr. Cooney-Koss and YRS representative, Gabrielle\n\nCasarino, testified and submitted their respective reports supporting their positions\n\nthat Defendant is amenable to the services of Family Court. Therefore, this factor\n\nweighs in favor of transfer.\n\n          3. Section 1011(b) Factor Three: Interest of Society and Defendant\n\n        20.      Defendant has not been placed in a Level IV or Level V Family Court\n\nfacility. It appears that Defendant has done well in a structured environment and\n\nYRS has indicated that it can provide future services to Defendant. Moreover, this\n\nCourt notes that Defendant has had open files with not only YRS but her family has\n\nhad open cases from 2005 since her birth.20 Cases were subsequently open during\n\nDefendant\u2019s lifetime through DFS but Prevention and Behavioral Health Services\n\n(PBH), as well.21         Per Dr. Cooney-Koss, Defendant requires a high level of\n\ninterventions that can best be provided through multi-disciplinary approaches. The\n\n\n\n20\n     DYRS Reverse Amenability Report by Gabrielle Casarino, at 1 (July 26. 2021).\n21\n     See generally, id. at 1-3.\n                                                9\n\fState did not provide any evidence to suggest that the same needs could be met in\n\nthe adult system. Therefore, it is in Defendant\u2019s best interest as well as society\u2019s to\n\nemploy such services and allow her an opportunity to take advantage of what may\n\nbe of benefit to her through Family Court.22\n\n                                      V.     CONCLUSION\n\n       Under \u00a7 1011(b), the Court finds that the factors weigh in favor of transfer.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer Charges to Family\n\nCourt is GRANTED.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED\n\n                                                     /s/ Vivian L.

At 15,1 Defendant Kiristen Mays-Robinson stands accused of two\n\ncounts of Robbery First Degree, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of\n\na Felony (PFDCF), Possession, Purchase, Own or Control of a Firearm by a\n\nProhibited Juvenile, Possession of a Weapon with a Removed, Obliterate or Altered\n\nSerial Number, Receiving a Stolen Firearm, Conspiracy Second Degree, and\n\nReceiving Stolen Property Over $1,500.2 It is alleged she committed these offenses\n\nwhen she was 14. She seeks to transfer her charges to Family Court under 10 Del.\n\nC. \u00a7 1011. A reverse amenability hearing was held on August 17, 2021. Upon\n\nconsideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, oral argument, and the record in this case,\n\nDefendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer Charges to Family Court is GRANTED.\n\n                 II.     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 3\n\n     2.       On November 19, 2020, New Castle County Police responded to a\n\nrobbery that had occurred in the area of Lighthouse Road and Haines Avenue in\n\nWilmington. At approximately 5:50 p.m., Norman Seltzer (Victim) had parked his\n\nvehicle in that area. While sitting in his car, Victim observed a black Toyota Prius\n\nenter the intersection, turn around and head in his direction.\n\n\n\n1\n  Defendant\u2019s date of birth is November 28, 2005.\n2\n  Indictment, True Bill Filed No. 41, State of Delaware v. Kiristen Mays-Robinson, Crim. ID No.\n2011008832, D.I. 2 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 26, 2021).\n3\n  This recitation is based upon oral argument and evidence presented at the reverse amenability\nhearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer on August 17, 2021.\n                                               2\n\f     3.     Victim exited his vehicle as the Toyota Prius approached him and\n\nnoticed a black female wearing a surgical mask driving the Prius. The Prius stopped\n\nand he then saw a second black female exit the vehicle from the rear passenger seat.\n\nThat female approached him, pointed a silver handgun, and demanded the keys to\n\nhis car.\n\n     4.     Upon command, Victim dropped his keys, wallet, phone and laptop bag\n\ncontaining a laptop and fled behind a nearby car, and then observed the suspects\n\nretrieved the same. Victim reported the incident to Delaware State Police.\n\n     5.     Soon thereafter, State Police observe a Toyota Prius parked at a gas\n\nstation on Philadelphia Pike in Claymont Delaware. The vehicle had been reported\n\nstolen to police two days prior on November 17. Police stopped the vehicle, and\n\nthree individuals fled from the car. Two of them were eventually located and\n\narrested, including Defendant and Ericka Miller (Miller.)\n\n     6.     During a search incident to arrest, Victim\u2019s cell phone is found in\n\nDefendant\u2019s pocket and a black and silver Smith & Wesson .40 caliber handgun with\n\nan extended magazine and obliterated serial number is found inside the vehicle. The\n\nhandgun was later determined to have been stolen.\n\n     7.     During a post-miranda interview, Defendant admitted to intentionally\n\nrobbing Victim. Defendant also stated she was aware of the handgun in the vehicle,\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fbut claimed she did not possess it, although she did admit to having possessed it\n\npreviously. Defendant also admitted to knowing that the Toyota Prius was stolen.\n\n     8.       Police also conducted a post-miranda interview with Miller who told\n\npolice they had planned to rob Victim and that it was Defendant who used the\n\nhandgun during the robbery.\n\n                             III.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     9.       The reverse amenability process is meant to identify juveniles charges\n\nas adults who are amenable to the rehabilitative process of the Family Court. 4 If the\n\njuvenile files a motion to transfer the adult charges, this Court must hold a reverse\n\namenability hearing and weigh the four factors set forth in 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1011(b).5\n\nThe Court may consider evidence of: (1) \u201c[t]he nature of the present offense and the\n\nextent and nature of the defendant\u2019s prior record, if any;\u201d 6 (2) \u201c[t]he nature of past\n\ntreatment and rehabilitative efforts and the nature of the defendant\u2019s response\n\nthereto, if any;\u201d7 (3) \u201c[w]hether the interests of society and the defendant would be\n\nbest served by trial in the Family Court or in the Superior Court[;]\u201d 8 and (4) any\n\n\u201cother factors which, in the judgment of the Court are deemed relevant.\u201d 9\n\n\n4\n  See generally 10 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1010-11; see also Hughes v. State, 653 A.2d 241, 249 (Del. 1994)\n(quoting Marine v. State, 624 A.2d 1181, 1184 (Del. 1993); Marine v. State, 607 A.2d 1185,\n1209 (Del. 1992)).\n5\n  See, e.g., State v. Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *5-7 (Del. Super. Mar. 31, 2014).\n6\n  10 Del.

DISCUSSION\n\n     A. Fair Likelihood of Conviction\n\n      10.     Before weighing the \u00a7 1011(b) factors, \u201cthis Court must preliminarily\n\ndetermine whether the State has made out a prima facie case against the juvenile.\u201d10\n\nThe Court considers \u201cwhether there is a fair likelihood that [the defendant] will be\n\nconvicted of the crimes charged.\u201d11 Furthermore, \u201c[a] real probability must exist\n\nthat a reasonable jury could convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that the\n\nevidence adduced at the reverse amenability hearing stands unrebutted by the\n\ndefendant at trial.\u201d12 Since Defendant was 14 at the time of the alleged offenses, the\n\nCourt need not consider the applicability of 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1447A(f) as to the firearm\n\ncharges.\n\n      11.     As noted at the Reverse Amenability hearing on August 17, as to the\n\nRobbery First Degree and accompanying charges, at this juncture, a reasonable jury\n\ncould convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that State\u2019s evidence stood\n\nunrebutted. Defendant admitted she intended to and did rob Victim along with\n\nMiller. Defendant was aware the .40 caliber handgun was in the vehicle, and while\n\nshe denies using it, Miller told police that it was Defendant who used and displayed\n\nthe gun during the robbery. Defendant also admitted to possessing the firearm in the\n\n\n10\n   Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *5 (citing Marine v. State, 624 A.2d 1181, 1185 (Del. 1993)).\n11\n   Id.\n12\n   Id.\n                                              5\n\fpast. Further, Defendant was also aware and admitted that the Toyota Prius she was\n\nin was a stolen vehicle. After reviewing the totality of the evidence presented, there\n\nis a fair likelihood that Defendant would be convicted of the charged offenses. For\n\nthese reasons and those stated on the record, the State has established its prima facia\n\ncase with a fair likelihood of conviction at trial.\n\n     B. Weighing \u00a7 1011(b)\u2019s Four Factors\n\n      12.      The purpose of \u201cdetermining a juveniles amenability is to place a\n\njudicial check on the prosecutorial charging of juveniles.\u201d13 However, 10 Del. C. \u00a7\n\n1010 states that when a juvenile is charged with the crime of Robbery First Degree\n\nwhere such offense involves the display of what appears to be a deadly weapon,\n\namong others, a child shall be proceeded against as an adult.14 Therefore, \u201csince a\n\njuvenile charged with a designated felony in the Superior Court has lost the benefit\n\nof Family Court adjudication by statutory pronouncement, there is a presumption\n\nthat need exists for adult discipline and legal restraint. Hence, the burden is upon\n\nthe juvenile to demonstrate to the contrary.\u201d15 In considering whether the factors\n\nweigh in favor of transfer, Defendant meets her burden.\n\n\n13\n   Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *4 (citing State v. Anderson, 697 A.2d 379, 383 (Del. 1997)).\n14\n   See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1010(a)(1).\n15\n   Harper, 2014 WL 1303012, at *4 (quoting Anderson, 385 A.2d at 740) (internal quotations\nomitted); see also State v. Mayhall, 659 A.2d 790, 795 (Del. Super. 1995) (\u201cI also take into\nconsideration the fact that by including second degree murder in those offenses where original\njurisdiction has been conferred on the Superior Court under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1010 the legislature has\ncreated a rebuttable presumption that juveniles charged with that crime should be tried as adults\nand the burden of proof rests with each defendant to rebut that presumption.\u201d).\n                                                6\n\f          1. Section 1011(b) Factor One: Nature of Present Offense and the Extent\n             and Nature of Defendant\u2019s Prior Record\n\n        13.      The first \u00a7 1011(b) factor is two pronged. 16 The charges against\n\nDefendant are violent and serious and weigh against transfer. The second prong also\n\nweighs against transfer. Defendant has previously been adjudicated delinquent for\n\ncharges of Conspiracy, Burglary, and Assault. Defendant then was later adjudicated\n\ndelinquent for violating the conditions of her probation and she picked up charges\n\nfor Receiving Stolen Property soon after. For these reasons, both prongs weigh\n\nagainst transfer.\n\n          2. Section 1011(b) Factor Two: Nature of Past Treatment and\n             Defendant\u2019s Response\n\n        14.      Defendant has never been placed in a Level IV or V facility, but she\n\nhas received services from YRS in the past. Defendant has been placed on GPS\n\nmonitoring on multiple occasions with inconsistent results when it comes to\n\nfollowing guidelines set forth by her probation officer. Defendant was also placed\n\non Pre-Trial Services between October 2019 and July 2020 but was arrested multiple\n\ntimes during that span.\n\n        15.      Defendant was sentenced in July 2020 to community supervision with\n\na YRS probation officer. During that time Defendant received multiple assessments\n\nwhich placed her at low to moderate risks for reoffending. The assessments noted\n\n\n16\n     See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1011(b)(1).\n                                            7\n\fthat Defendant was in most need of treatment for Relationships, Mental Health,\n\nEmployment and Family & Social Support.\n\n     16.        Defendant has spent time in non-secure detention facilities including\n\nVision Quest RAD where overall she did well. While at RAD, Defendant had\n\npositive behaviors and was completing schoolwork. Following her arrest for these\n\ncharges, Defendant has been detained at the New Castle County Detention Center\n\nwhere she has maintained a positive attitude and achieved (lost and regained) gold\n\nshirt status.\n\n     17.        Laura Cooney-Koss, Psy.D. testified on behalf of Defendant. Dr.\n\nCooney-Koss opined that Defendant had been \u201cprofoundly impacted by her history\n\nof sexual abuse\u201d for which she had never been treated. 17 Dr. Cooney-Koss also\n\nstated that Defendant qualified for several psychiatric diagnoses, including\n\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, Attention\n\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Cannabis and\n\nTobacco Use Disorder, and Specific Learning Disorder. 18\n\n     18.        Dr. Cooney-Koss opined it \u201cis imperative that [Defendant] receive\n\nindividual mental health treatment, with a specific focus on her trauma history.\u201d19\n\nDr. Cooney-Koss also noted that while Defendant has received some intervention\n\n\n17\n   Psychological Evaluation by Laura Cooney-Koss, Psy.D., at 20 (June 2, 2021).\n18\n   Id. at 20-21.\n19\n   Id. at 21.\n                                              8\n\ffrom YRS, none of them have been therapeutic interventions which she believes are\n\nmost critical to address Defendant\u2019s needs.\n\n        19.      YRS testified for the State. However, YRS concurred with Dr. Cooney-\n\nKoss that the Department of Services for Children, Youth & their Families\n\n(DSCYF,) and specifically, YRS, could continue to provide services to Defendant\n\nthrough the Family Court. Both Dr. Cooney-Koss and YRS representative, Gabrielle\n\nCasarino, testified and submitted their respective reports supporting their positions\n\nthat Defendant is amenable to the services of Family Court. Therefore, this factor\n\nweighs in favor of transfer.\n\n          3. Section 1011(b) Factor Three: Interest of Society and Defendant\n\n        20.      Defendant has not been placed in a Level IV or Level V Family Court\n\nfacility. It appears that Defendant has done well in a structured environment and\n\nYRS has indicated that it can provide future services to Defendant. Moreover, this\n\nCourt notes that Defendant has had open files with not only YRS but her family has\n\nhad open cases from 2005 since her birth.20 Cases were subsequently open during\n\nDefendant\u2019s lifetime through DFS but Prevention and Behavioral Health Services\n\n(PBH), as well.21         Per Dr. Cooney-Koss, Defendant requires a high level of\n\ninterventions that can best be provided through multi-disciplinary approaches. The\n\n\n\n20\n     DYRS Reverse Amenability Report by Gabrielle Casarino, at 1 (July 26. 2021).\n21\n     See generally, id. at 1-3.\n                                                9\n\fState did not provide any evidence to suggest that the same needs could be met in\n\nthe adult system. Therefore, it is in Defendant\u2019s best interest as well as society\u2019s to\n\nemploy such services and allow her an opportunity to take advantage of what may\n\nbe of benefit to her through Family Court.22\n\n                                      V.     CONCLUSION\n\n       Under \u00a7 1011(b), the Court finds that the factors weigh in favor of transfer.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer Charges to Family\n\nCourt is GRANTED.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED\n\n                                                     /s/ Vivian L.

DISCUSSION\n\n     A. Fair Likelihood of Conviction\n\n      10.     Before weighing the \u00a7 1011(b) factors, \u201cthis Court must preliminarily\n\ndetermine whether the State has made out a prima facie case against the juvenile.\u201d10\n\nThe Court considers \u201cwhether there is a fair likelihood that [the defendant] will be\n\nconvicted of the crimes charged.\u201d11 Furthermore, \u201c[a] real probability must exist\n\nthat a reasonable jury could convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that the\n\nevidence adduced at the reverse amenability hearing stands unrebutted by the\n\ndefendant at trial.\u201d12 Since Defendant was 14 at the time of the alleged offenses, the\n\nCourt need not consider the applicability of 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1447A(f) as to the firearm\n\ncharges.\n\n      11.     As noted at the Reverse Amenability hearing on August 17, as to the\n\nRobbery First Degree and accompanying charges, at this juncture, a reasonable jury\n\ncould convict on the totality of the evidence assuming that State\u2019s evidence stood\n\nunrebutted. Defendant admitted she intended to and did rob Victim along with\n\nMiller. Defendant was aware the .40 caliber handgun was in the vehicle, and while\n\nshe denies using it, Miller told police that it was Defendant who used and displayed\n\nthe gun during the robbery. Defendant also admitted to possessing the firearm in the\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">10\n   Harper, 2014</span><pre class=\"inline\"> WL 1303012, at *5 (citing Marine v.

Further, Defendant was also aware and admitted that the Toyota Prius she was\n\nin was a stolen vehicle. After reviewing the totality of the evidence presented, there\n\nis a fair likelihood that Defendant would be convicted of the charged offenses. For\n\nthese reasons and those stated on the record, the State has established its prima facia\n\ncase with a fair likelihood of conviction at trial.\n\n     B. Weighing \u00a7 1011(b)\u2019s Four Factors\n\n      12.      The purpose of \u201cdetermining a juveniles amenability is to place a\n\njudicial check on the prosecutorial charging of juveniles.\u201d13 However, 10 Del. C. \u00a7\n\n1010 states that when a juvenile is charged with the crime of Robbery First Degree\n\nwhere such offense involves the display of what appears to be a deadly weapon,\n\namong others, a child shall be proceeded against as an adult.14 Therefore, \u201csince a\n\njuvenile charged with a designated felony in the Superior Court has lost the benefit\n\nof Family Court adjudication by statutory pronouncement, there is a presumption\n\nthat need exists for adult discipline and legal restraint. Hence, the burden is upon\n\nthe juvenile to demonstrate to the contrary.\u201d15 In considering whether the factors\n\nweigh in favor of transfer, Defendant meets her burden.\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">13\n   Harper, 2014</span><pre class=\"inline\"> WL 1303012, at *4 (citing State v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">697 A.2d 379</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383 (Del. 1997)).\n14\n   See 10 Del.

Super. 1995) (\u201cI also take into\nconsideration the fact that by including second degree murder in those offenses where original\njurisdiction has been conferred on the Superior Court under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1010 the legislature has\ncreated a rebuttable presumption that juveniles charged with that crime should be tried as adults\nand the burden of proof rests with each defendant to rebut that presumption.\u201d).\n                                                6\n\f          1. Section 1011(b) Factor One: Nature of Present Offense and the Extent\n             and Nature of Defendant\u2019s Prior Record\n\n        13.      The first \u00a7 1011(b) factor is two pronged. 16 The charges against\n\nDefendant are violent and serious and weigh against transfer. The second prong also\n\nweighs against transfer. Defendant has previously been adjudicated delinquent for\n\ncharges of Conspiracy, Burglary, and Assault. Defendant then was later adjudicated\n\ndelinquent for violating the conditions of her probation and she picked up charges\n\nfor Receiving Stolen Property soon after. For these reasons, both prongs weigh\n\nagainst transfer.\n\n          2. Section 1011(b) Factor Two: Nature of Past Treatment and\n             Defendant\u2019s Response\n\n        14.      Defendant has never been placed in a Level IV or V facility, but she\n\nhas received services from YRS in the past. Defendant has been placed on GPS\n\nmonitoring on multiple occasions with inconsistent results when it comes to\n\nfollowing guidelines set forth by her probation officer. Defendant was also placed\n\non Pre-Trial Services between October 2019 and July 2020 but was arrested multiple\n\ntimes during that span.\n\n        15.      Defendant was sentenced in July 2020 to community supervision with\n\na YRS probation officer. During that time Defendant received multiple assessments\n\nwhich placed her at low to moderate risks for reoffending. The assessments noted\n\n\n16\n     See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1011(b)(1).\n                                            7\n\fthat Defendant was in most need of treatment for Relationships, Mental Health,\n\nEmployment and Family & Social Support.\n\n     16.        Defendant has spent time in non-secure detention facilities including\n\nVision Quest RAD where overall she did well. While at RAD, Defendant had\n\npositive behaviors and was completing schoolwork. Following her arrest for these\n\ncharges, Defendant has been detained at the New Castle County Detention Center\n\nwhere she has maintained a positive attitude and achieved (lost and regained) gold\n\nshirt status.\n\n     17.        Laura Cooney-Koss, Psy.D. testified on behalf of Defendant. Dr.\n\nCooney-Koss opined that Defendant had been \u201cprofoundly impacted by her history\n\nof sexual abuse\u201d for which she had never been treated. 17 Dr. Cooney-Koss also\n\nstated that Defendant qualified for several psychiatric diagnoses, including\n\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, Attention\n\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Cannabis and\n\nTobacco Use Disorder, and Specific Learning Disorder. 18\n\n     18.        Dr. Cooney-Koss opined it \u201cis imperative that [Defendant] receive\n\nindividual mental health treatment, with a specific focus on her trauma history.\u201d19\n\nDr. Cooney-Koss also noted that while Defendant has received some intervention\n\n\n17\n   Psychological Evaluation by Laura Cooney-Koss, Psy.D., at 20 (June 2, 2021).\n18\n   Id. at 20-21.\n19\n   Id. at 21.\n                                              8\n\ffrom YRS, none of them have been therapeutic interventions which she believes are\n\nmost critical to address Defendant\u2019s needs.\n\n        19.      YRS testified for the State. However, YRS concurred with Dr. Cooney-\n\nKoss that the Department of Services for Children, Youth & their Families\n\n(DSCYF,) and specifically, YRS, could continue to provide services to Defendant\n\nthrough the Family Court. Both Dr. Cooney-Koss and YRS representative, Gabrielle\n\nCasarino, testified and submitted their respective reports supporting their positions\n\nthat Defendant is amenable to the services of Family Court. Therefore, this factor\n\nweighs in favor of transfer.\n\n          3. Section 1011(b) Factor Three: Interest of Society and Defendant\n\n        20.      Defendant has not been placed in a Level IV or Level V Family Court\n\nfacility. It appears that Defendant has done well in a structured environment and\n\nYRS has indicated that it can provide future services to Defendant. Moreover, this\n\nCourt notes that Defendant has had open files with not only YRS but her family has\n\nhad open cases from 2005 since her birth.20 Cases were subsequently open during\n\nDefendant\u2019s lifetime through DFS but Prevention and Behavioral Health Services\n\n(PBH), as well.21         Per Dr. Cooney-Koss, Defendant requires a high level of\n\ninterventions that can best be provided through multi-disciplinary approaches. The\n\n\n\n20\n     DYRS Reverse Amenability Report by Gabrielle Casarino, at 1 (July 26. 2021).\n21\n     See generally, id. at 1-3.\n                                                9\n\fState did not provide any evidence to suggest that the same needs could be met in\n\nthe adult system. Therefore, it is in Defendant\u2019s best interest as well as society\u2019s to\n\nemploy such services and allow her an opportunity to take advantage of what may\n\nbe of benefit to her through Family Court.22\n\n                                      V.     CONCLUSION\n\n       Under \u00a7 1011(b), the Court finds that the factors weigh in favor of transfer.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Transfer Charges to Family\n\nCourt is GRANTED.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED\n\n                                                     /s/ Vivian L.

MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n TARANTO, Circuit Judge.\n     The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded vet-\n eran Geraldo Ortiz benefits for a service-connected disabil-\n ity based on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acting\n pursuant to a regulatory change that lightened his previ-\n ous evidentiary burden. The dispute before us concerns the\n starting date for the benefits awarded, i.e., the effective\n date of the award. We conclude that the regulatory change\n that enabled Mr. Ortiz to obtain the benefits was a \u201cliber-\n alizing\u201d one, entitling Mr. Ortiz to the earlier effective date,\n and hence the larger award, that he seeks.\n     Mr. Ortiz had first claimed service-connected disability\n benefits based on PTSD, under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110, in 1997.\n But VA denied the claim because Mr. Ortiz did not provide\n corroborating evidence, as required by the PTSD regula-\n tion, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f), that the events identified as lead-\n ing to his PTSD occurred in his military service. That\n decision became final. Years later, in 2010, the Secretary\n of Veterans Affairs amended \u00a7 3.304(f) by adding what is\n now subsection (f)(3) to state an exception to the corrobo-\n rating-evidence requirement in circumstances like those of\n Mr. Ortiz. On May 22, 2012, more than a year after the\n regulatory change took effect, Mr. Ortiz moved to reopen\n his claim, invoking the newly lightened proof requirement.\n Within months, VA reopened his claim and granted the\n claim, rating him 100 percent disabled and making the\n benefits effective as of May 22, 2012, the date VA received\n the request to reopen.\n     Mr. Ortiz contended that the effective date should have\n been one year earlier (May 22, 2011). For that contention,\n he relied on 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a), which implements 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) and provides that when compensation \u201cis\n awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a\n liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the\n Secretary\u2019s direction\u201d and the \u201cclaim [for compensation] is\n reviewed at the request of the claimant more than 1 year\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 3    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                         3\n\n\n\n after the effective date of the law or VA issue,\u201d the effective\n date is \u201c1 year prior to the date of receipt of such request.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a)(3). Mr. Ortiz argued that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3)\n was a \u201cliberalizing\u201d law or VA issue, entitling him to the\n extra year of benefits. The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals and\n then the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans\n Court) rejected his request for an earlier effective date.\n While accepting that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim was granted \u201cpursu-\n ant to\u201d \u00a7 3.304(f)(3), they concluded that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) was\n not a \u201cliberalizing\u201d measure.\n     We reverse.       We conclude that the addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) in 2010 was \u201cliberalizing\u201d under \u00a7 3.114(a). It\n is sufficient to come within \u00a7 3.114(a)\u2019s \u201cliberalizing\u201d cate-\n gory that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) reduced a veteran\u2019s affirmative bur-\n den of production to establish an element of entitlement to\n compensation. In these circumstances, the correct effective\n date for Mr. Ortiz\u2019s benefits is May 22, 2011, rather than\n May 22, 2012. 1\n                               I\n                               A\n     The precedents that the parties principally debate are\n Spencer v. Brown, 17 F.3d 368 (Fed. Cir. 1994), and Routen\n v. West, 142 F.3d 1434 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In those decisions,\n this court did not directly interpret and apply the effective-\n date \u201cliberalizing\u201d regulation at issue here, 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 3.114(a), to answer an effective-date question, as no such\n question was presented. Rather, the court relied on 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a) to draw an infer-\n ence about a circumstance in which a new original claim is\n not barred by the otherwise-governing statutory finality\n\n\n     1   Unless noted otherwise, all citations are to provi-\n sions as they existed before the Veterans Appeals Improve-\n ment and Modernization Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115\u201355,\n 131 Stat. 1105, and the regulations implementing that Act.\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 4    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n protections that attach to rejection of an earlier claim. It\n is useful, therefore, to begin with a summary of the statu-\n tory and regulatory provisions that provide a general rule\n of finality for claim-rejecting VA decisions but allow for ex-\n ceptions, including the exception recognized in Spencer and\n Routen.\n     Statutes and regulations governing veterans benefits\n expressly state general rules of finality for VA decisions.\n That is so for a decision by a VA regional office (or agency\n of original jurisdiction) unless timely appealed to the\n Board. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(c) (\u201cIf no notice of disagree-\n ment is filed in accordance with this chapter within the\n prescribed period, the action or determination shall become\n final and the claim will not thereafter be reopened or al-\n lowed, except as may otherwise be provided by regulations\n not inconsistent with this title.\u201d); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 20.1104,\n 3.104(a), 3.2600. And it is also so for a Board decision un-\n less timely appealed to the Veterans Court. See 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7104(b) (\u201cExcept as provided in section 5108 of this title,\n when a claim is disallowed by the Board, the claim may not\n thereafter be reopened and allowed and a claim based upon\n the same factual basis may not be considered.\u201d); 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 20.1100.\n      As the above-quoted statutes make clear, however, ex-\n ceptions are authorized. One exception, not invoked in the\n present case, is for \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d in the\n original decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(a), 7111; see also 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1400. A decision reversing or revising the ear-\n lier decision on that basis \u201chas the same effect as if the de-\n cision had been made on the date of the prior decision,\u201d 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A, 7111, so the effective date of an award of\n benefits previously \u201cdenied due to clear and unmistakable\n error\u201d is as early as \u201cthe veteran\u2019s filing of the original\n claim,\u201d Sears v. Principi, 349 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir.\n 2003); see also 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(k). A second exception,\n which was invoked in the present case, is for \u201creopening\u201d\n based on \u201cnew and material evidence.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108;\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 5    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

See Sears,\n 349 F.3d at 1331; 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(q)\u2013(r). 3\n     This court concluded in Spencer that, in Routen\u2019s\n words, there is also a \u201cthird\u201d path around an otherwise-fi-\n nal claim rejection\u2014namely, a new original claim\u2014if cer-\n tain statutory or agency-adopted changes have been made\n since the earlier rejection. Routen, 142 F.3d at 1438, 1442.\n The court in Spencer quoted with approval the Veterans\n Court\u2019s reasoning:\n     When a provision of law or regulation creates a new\n     basis of entitlement to benefits, as through liberal-\n     ization of the requirements for entitlement to a\n     benefit, an applicant\u2019s claim of entitlement under\n     such law or regulation is a claim separate and dis-\n     tinct from a claim previously and finally denied\n\n\n     2    Section 5108 now is titled \u201cSupplemental claims,\u201d\n uses the term \u201creadjudicate\u201d rather than \u201creopen,\u201d and re-\n quires \u201cnew and relevant\u201d instead of \u201cnew and material\u201d ev-\n idence. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108(a) (\u201cIn General.\u2014If new and\n relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a\n supplemental claim, the Secretary shall readjudicate the\n claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of rec-\n ord.\u201d); see also 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(a) (implementing \u00a7 5108).\n     3    A regulation provides for different effective-date\n treatment in defined circumstances when a claim is reo-\n pened and reconsidered based on \u201crelevant official service\n department records that existed and had not been associ-\n ated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(c)(1). In that situation, an award may\n have an effective date as early as \u201cthe date VA received the\n previously decided claim.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3.156(c)(3); see also Blub-\n augh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014);\n Loyd v. Shulkin, 682 F. App\u2019x 906, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 6    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n     prior to the liberalizing law or regulation. The ap-\n     plicant\u2019s later claim, asserting rights which did not\n     exist at the time of the prior claim, is necessarily a\n     different claim.\n Spencer, 17 F.3d at 372 (quoting Spencer v. Brown, 4 Vet.\n App. 283, 288\u201389 (1993) (Spencer CAVC); alteration and\n internal quotation marks omitted). This court agreed with\n the Veterans Court that the finality protection of \u00a7 7104(b)\n \u201c\u2018does not preclude de novo adjudication of a claim, on es-\n sentially the same facts as a previously and finally denied\n claim, where an intervening and substantive change in law\n or regulation created a new basis for entitlement to a ben-\n efit.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Spencer CAVC, 4 Vet. App. at 289).\n      In ruling that the statute allows a new original claim\n based on certain changes of law, notwithstanding the oth-\n erwise-prescribed finality of an earlier claim\u2019s rejection,\n this court and the Veterans Court in Spencer, as well as\n this court in Routen, relied on what they found to be a nec-\n essary implication of a statutory effective-date provision,\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g), implemented by 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a).\n Routen, 142 F.3d at 1441 (relying on statute and regula-\n tion); Spencer, 17 F.3d at 371 (relying on statute); Spencer\n CAVC, 4 Vet. App. at 287\u201389 (relying on statute and regu-\n lation). The decisions in those cases do not directly apply\n those provisions, which merely prescribe an effective date\n for certain awards of compensation; there was no effective-\n date issue in those cases because there were no awards in\n those cases at all. Rather, the courts in those cases dis-\n cerned in the effective-date statute (and regulation) an im-\n plied presupposition that a new original claim must\n sometimes be available, modifying the otherwise-applica-\n ble statutory (and regulatory) guarantees of finality of an\n earlier decision. The court in Routen itself stressed that\n very difference\u2014between direct application of the effective-\n date provisions (which was not at issue) and the scope of\n an implied statutory modification to allow a new original\n claim (which was). See 142 F.3d at 1441.\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 7    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

Addressing a change-of-law situation, it provides\n that, \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of section 5101\u201d (concern-\n ing \u201cclaims and forms\u201d),\n     where compensation . . . is awarded or increased\n     pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the ef-\n     fective date of such award or increase shall be fixed\n     in accordance with the facts found but shall not be\n     earlier than the effective date of the Act or admin-\n     istrative issue. In no event shall such award or in-\n     crease be retroactive for more than one year from\n     the date of application therefor or the date of ad-\n     ministrative determination of entitlement, which-\n     ever is earlier.\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g). The language is not limited to recon-\n sideration of a claim, but reaches an original claim. And it\n applies not just where \u201ccompensation . . . is awarded\u201d\n (where no compensation had previously been awarded) but\n also where \u201ccompensation . . . is . . . increased\u201d (where, for\n example, a rating is increased).\n     A regulation, also dating back to 1962, implements that\n statutory subsection. Under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114, titled\n \u201cChange of law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue,\u201d\n subsection (a) provides:\n     (a) Effective date of award. Where . . . compensa-\n     tion . . . is awarded or increased pursuant to a lib-\n     eralizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved\n     by the Secretary or by the Secretary\u2019s direction, the\n     effective date of such award or increase shall be\n     fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 8    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n     not be earlier than the effective date of the act or\n     administrative issue. Where . . . compensation . . .\n     is awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing\n     law or VA issue which became effective on or after\n     the date of its enactment or issuance, in order for a\n     claimant to be eligible for a retroactive payment\n     under the provisions of this paragraph the evidence\n     must show that the claimant met all eligibility cri-\n     teria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date\n     of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such\n     eligibility existed continuously from that date to\n     the date of claim or administrative determination\n     of entitlement. The provisions of this paragraph\n     are applicable to original and reopened claims as\n     well as claims for increase.\n         (1) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of\n         VA within 1 year from the effective date of\n         the law or VA issue, or at the request of a\n         claimant received within 1 year from that\n         date, benefits may be authorized from the\n         effective date of the law or VA issue.\n         (2) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of\n         VA more than 1 year after the effective date\n         of the law or VA issue, benefits may be au-\n         thorized for a period of 1 year prior to the\n         date of administrative determination of en-\n         titlement.\n         (3) If a claim is reviewed at the request of\n         the claimant more than 1 year after the ef-\n         fective date of the law or VA issue, benefits\n         may be authorized for a period of 1 year\n         prior to the date of receipt of such request.\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 9    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

The regulation expressly applies to\n \u201coriginal and reopened claims as well as claims for in-\n crease.\u201d Id. 4\n     There is dispute about what the consequences are for\n the effective date of an award when, on a claim that has\n been reopened, the award is made \u201cpursuant to\u201d a \u201cliberal-\n izing\u201d change. In that situation, the award\u2019s effective date\n may not be earlier than the effective date of the underlying\n change, but it may be as early as one year before the re-\n quest based on the change was made. See McCay v. Brown,\n 106 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The issue in this case\n is whether \u00a7 3.114(a) applies to a particular regulatory\n change.\n                               C\n      Mr. Ortiz served during the Vietnam era, a \u201cperiod of\n war,\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(f), within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1110, which provides for compensation for service-con-\n nected disability\u2014specifically, \u201c[f]or disability resulting\n from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line\n of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered\n or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military,\n naval, or air service, during a period of war\u201d\u2014subject to\n exceptions that do not apply here. It is undisputed before\n us that, having earlier denied Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim for disabil-\n ity benefits based on PTSD, VA reopened Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim\n for such benefits and granted the claim in 2012 and that\n VA did so pursuant to the 2010 addition of what is now\n subsection (f)(3) to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304. There is no dispute\n about the propriety of the reopening or the grant. The only\n question presented concerns the proper effective date un-\n der 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a), and the only issue in dispute about\n\n\n\n     4  Amended to implement the statutory changes from\n the Modernization Act, the regulation now reads \u201coriginal\n and supplemental claims as well as claims for increase.\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 10    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n the applicability of \u00a7 3.114(a) is whether the 2010 adoption\n of what is now \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) was a \u201cliberalizing\u201d change un-\n der \u00a7 3.114(a). The proper resolution depends on the regu-\n lations governing PTSD-based claims for service-connected\n disability benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110.\n      To secure benefits under \u00a7 1110 (or under \u00a7 1131,\n which governs peacetime service), a veteran generally\n must \u201csatisfy a three-element test: (1) the existence of a\n present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation\n of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between\n the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or\n aggravated during service\u2014the so-called \u2018nexus\u2019 require-\n ment.\u201d Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir.\n 2013). Congress prescribed in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a) that the\n Secretary must provide, in regulations governing service\n connection, for consideration of various facts and types of\n evidence. For \u201cany veteran who engaged in combat with\n the enemy in active service,\u201d Congress added, in \u00a7 1154(b),\n that \u201cthe Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of ser-\n vice-connection . . . satisfactory lay or other evidence of ser-\n vice incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease, if\n consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships\n of such service . . . .

After Mr. Ortiz\u2019s original claim was finally\n decided, but a couple of years before Mr. Ortiz moved to\n reopen his claim, the Secretary further implemented 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 1154 and promulgated an additional exception\u2014\n what is now 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f)(3)\u2014to the general require-\n ments for a claim of entitlement based on PTSD.

We decide the issue\n without applying the deference doctrine of Auer v. Robbins,\n 519 U.S. 452 (1997), as clarified in Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S.\n Ct. 2400 (2019). Although we doubt that the doctrine\n would apply to the question presented, we need not decide\n the doctrine\u2019s applicability, or whether our answer to the\n legal question is a matter of unambiguous meaning (mak-\n ing the doctrine immaterial), because the Secretary does\n not invoke the doctrine.

This general meaning was common at the\n time of \u00a7 3.114(a)\u2019s promulgation and the 2010 amendment\n to \u00a7 3.304, and it remains common now. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s\n Third New International Dictionary 1303 (1961) (\u201cto make\n less strict or rigorous\u201d); The American College Dictionary\n 702 (1962) (\u201cto make or become more liberal,\u201d i.e., \u201cnot\n strict or rigorous\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary 727\n (2d College ed. 1982) (similar); Oxford English Dictionary\n (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cto free from narrowness\u201d and \u201c[t]o remove\n restrictions on\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary of the\n English Language 1036\u201337 (3d ed. 1992) (\u201cTo make liberal\n or more liberal,\u201d i.e., \u201c[n]ot strict\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n 1057 (10th ed. 2009) (\u201cTo make a system, laws, policies, or\n moral attitudes less strict, censorious, and rhadaman-\n thine.\u201d); Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (\u201cto free\n from narrowness or strictness; to relax\u201d); see also, e.g., S.\n Rep.

Before the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3), the legal standard governing a claim of PTSD-\n based disability in Mr. Ortiz\u2019s circumstances required cor-\n roborating evidence, beyond the veteran\u2019s own testimony,\n to confirm the in-service occurrence of the asserted\n stressor. The 2010 change eliminated that requirement of\n the affirmative case for veterans like Mr. Ortiz. The re-\n quirements for affirmatively showing entitlement, in short,\n became less strict. See Sanchez-Navarro, 774 F.3d at 1384\n (Section \u201c3.304(f)(3) applies a more relaxed standard\u201d than\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 16    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 16                                       ORTIZ   v.

For good reason: Be-\n fore the change, Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim was rejected, whereas af-\n ter the change, it was granted undisputedly because of the\n elimination of a concrete component of what he was previ-\n ously required to show in his affirmative case for entitle-\n ment to an award.\n      In fact, the 2010 change is a prototypical example of a\n \u201cliberalizing\u201d change resulting in an \u201caward.\u201d Cf. McBoyle\n v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.) (rely-\n ing on the idea of a \u201cpicture\u201d \u201cevoke[d] in the common\n mind\u201d). The term \u201cliberalizing\u201d when used with \u201claw\u201d and\n \u201cVA issue\u201d in the context of a \u201cclaim\u201d most naturally covers\n a relaxation of a claimant\u2019s affirmative burden. That is ex-\n actly what the 2010 change does. A veteran generally has\n the affirmative burden of production to establish the ele-\n ments of a claim of entitlement (though VA has a duty to\n assist). See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise pro-\n vided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present\n and support a claim for benefits under laws administered\n by the Secretary.\u201d); id. \u00a7 5103A (duty to assist); 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 3.159 (implementing \u00a7 5103A). The 2010 amendment\n changed concrete components of what VA must consider\n \u201csufficient proof,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b), to establish an ele-\n ment of entitlement, so it relaxed the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n responsibility in presenting and supporting a claim for ben-\n efits.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 17     Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                        17\n\n\n\n      This meaning fits the context of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g)\n and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a). Those provisions provide up to\n one extra year of benefits when an award has been made\n or increased pursuant to a qualifying \u201c[c]hange of law or\n [VA] issue\u201d (\u00a7 3.114(a) title)\u2014allowing veterans a brief ex-\n tra period to become aware and to take advantage of a\n change that newly entitles them to an award or an increase\n of compensation. The ordinary meaning of \u201cliberalizing\u201d is\n not in any way out of place in that context. When Congress\n enacted the provision now codified as \u00a7 5110(g), the con-\n gressional committees, using the language of \u201cliberalizing,\u201d\n explained: \u201cClaimants who have no knowledge of the bene-\n fits or are not identified by [VA] . . . may be penalized by\n not filing promptly.\u201d S. Rep. No. 87-2041, at 6; H. Rep. No.\n 87-2123 at 6 (same). Applying the term\u2019s ordinary meaning\n mitigates the delay penalty.\n                               B\n      The Secretary nevertheless argues that we should not\n apply the ordinary meaning of \u201cliberalizing\u201d here, resting\n that argument entirely on Spencer and Routen. For two\n independent reasons, however, we reject the argument.\n First, neither Spencer nor Routen actually decided the is-\n sue of what changes suffice to trigger application of the reg-\n ulation (or, for that matter, of the statute) to give a veteran\n the earlier effective date. They decided a different issue:\n what the implications of the statute (and regulation) are\n for the availability of a new original claim that, outside the\n statutory reconsideration paths, avoids the otherwise-ap-\n plicable statutory bar based on a previous final rejection of\n a veteran\u2019s earlier claim. Second, the change in the present\n case materially differs from the particular changes that the\n court in Spencer and Routen held insufficient to allow a\n new original claim. We conclude not only that the two prec-\n edents provide no persuasive basis for rejecting the ordi-\n nary-meaning application of \u201cliberalizing\u201d to cover\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) but also that, even if the formulations used by\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 18    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 18                                       ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n Spencer and Routen are borrowed to define \u201cliberalizing,\u201d\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) qualifies.\n                               1\n      Unlike this case, neither Spencer nor Routen involved\n an effective-date issue, so in neither case did this court di-\n rectly apply 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a) or decide what \u201cliberaliz-\n ing\u201d means in identifying a change of law or VA issue that\n qualifies for the earlier effective date of an award. Indeed,\n unlike this case\u2014where the claim was reopened and there\n is no dispute about the propriety of that reopening (or grant\n of the claim)\u2014neither Spencer nor Routen involved a claim\n that was reopened under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108. The portions of\n both decisions on which the Secretary relies involve only\n whether a new original claim was available because of the\n asserted change of law or regulation.\n     In Spencer, the veteran had filed a claim for benefits\n based on his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. 17 F.3d at 370.\n The regional office denied his claim because he failed to\n provide sufficient evidence that \u201cthe disability was in-\n curred in or aggravated by his service in the military.\u201d Id.\n The regional office\u2019s decision became final. Years later, the\n veteran sought both to reopen his finally decided claim be-\n cause of new and material evidence and to have his claim\n considered as a new original claim because there was an\n \u201cintervening change in law,\u201d namely the passage of the Vet-\n erans\u2019 Judicial Review Act of 1988 (VJRA). Id. at 371\u201373.\n The Board, and then the Veterans Court, determined that\n the veteran\u2019s claim warranted neither reopening nor fresh\n consideration. Id. at 370\u201371.\n     We agreed. As to the denial of reopening for want of\n new and material evidence, we concluded that we lacked\n jurisdiction to address it, for reasons not pertinent to the\n issue now before us in this case. See id. at 373\u201374. The\n veteran\u2019s right to proceed therefore depended on whether\n he had available a new original claim. We adopted the Vet-\n erans Court\u2019s conclusion, as quoted above, that \u00a7 5110(g),\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34     Page: 19    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                      19\n\n\n\n though not directly authorizing a new avenue for reconsid-\n eration of a final decision, implicitly presupposes that\n sometimes a change of law or regulation can support the\n availability of a new original claim; but we recognized that\n such availability requires a modification of the express\n statutory protection of finality, notably that of \u00a7 7104, and\n the limited express statutory provisions for reconsidera-\n tion. Id. at 371\u201372; Spencer CAVC, 4 Vet. App. at 287\u201389.\n It was in harmonizing express statutory commands (final-\n ity, with two limited paths around finality) with an impli-\n cation from another statutory provision directed at another\n issue (effective dates) that we decided that a new original\n claim requires \u201ca new basis of entitlement to a claimed ben-\n efit as the result of an intervening change in law or regula-\n tion.\u201d Spencer, 17 F.3d at 373. And we held that the\n generic VJRA changes on which the veteran relied did not\n meet that standard because they \u201cwere unmistakably pro-\n cedural in nature\u201d and thus did not \u201csubstantively affect[]\n the nature\u201d of the finally decided claim. Id. at 372\u201373.\n     Routen involved a materially identical posture. In that\n case, the veteran\u2019s claim had been denied in a final decision\n before the relevant regulatory change. 142 F.3d at 1436\u2013\n 37. After the regulatory change (concerning the govern-\n ment\u2019s rebuttal burden on in-service aggravation of a\n preexisting injury), the veteran sought to reopen his claim\n based on new and material evidence and to have his claim\n considered de novo as a new original claim. Id. The re-\n gional office declined to reopen the veteran\u2019s claim for new\n and material evidence and did not consider the claim a new\n original claim. Id. The Board and the Veterans Court\n again agreed with the regional office. Id.\n     So did we. As to the denial of reopening, we determined\n that a \u201cpresumption\u201d is not itself new and material evi-\n dence. Id. at 1439\u201341. As to the new-original-claim issue,\n we concluded that the relevant regulatory amendment was\n insufficient to support allowing the claim as a new original\n one. Id. at 1441\u201342. We recognized that the issue was one\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 20    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 20                                       ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n of seeking to harmonize the express statutory finality prin-\n ciple of \u00a7 7104 with an implied presupposition found in\n \u00a7 5110(g) (and its implementing regulation), where neither\n of the two express statutory authorizations for reconsider-\n ation (clear and unmistakable error, and reopening) was\n applicable. Routen, 142 F.3d at 1442 (emphasizing that\n \u201cthe logic of the intervening change rule, if it is to escape\n the bar of \u00a7 7104(b), must be that the intervening change\n in law creates a new cause of action\u201d). And we held that\n changing the government\u2019s rebuttal burden (newly to re-\n quire clear and unmistakable evidence) was a \u201cprocedural\u201d\n one, and made no \u201csubstantive change\u201d in what the veteran\n had to show to be entitled to an award, and thus did not\n support recognition of a new original claim. Id.\n      Spencer and Routen therefore involved only the ques-\n tion of how far express statutory provisions\u2014the statutory\n finality bar, subject to only limited express statutory routes\n for reconsideration\u2014had to be deemed implicitly modified\n by \u00a7 5110(g) and its implementing regulation, which ad-\n dress only the effective date of an award for which the stat-\n ute elsewhere provides express authority. That is not the\n question here. In this case, there is no question of modify-\n ing an express statutory means for reconsideration: It is\n undisputed before us that one of the express means (reo-\n pening based on new and material evidence) was properly\n used. The only question here is the proper application of\n the effective-date prescription (\u00a7 5110(g) as implemented\n by \u00a7 3.114(a)) in a matter that undisputedly fell within an\n express statutory avenue of reconsideration. That question\n did not arise in Spencer and Routen, and unlike the ques-\n tion answered in those cases, the question here does not\n present any facial conflict with other express legal con-\n straints whose modification must be minimized. Routen it-\n self recognized that the questions are distinct. 142 F.3d at\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 21    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

Spencer and Routen do not control the resolution\n of the issue here. And the Secretary has given no sound\n reason that the questions in those cases and the question\n in this case must have the same answer. Relying only on\n Spencer and Routen, which we conclude do not control, the\n Secretary has furnished no reason that interpretation of\n the regulation at issue, \u00a7 3.114, should depart from its or-\n dinary meaning\u2014which makes sense in context and under\n\n\n\n\n     7    The distinction is reinforced by the fact that the\n statute (\u00a7 5110(g)) and the regulation (\u00a7 3.114(a)) include\n changes that result in an \u201cincrease\u201d of an already granted\n award, yet the court in Routen spoke of a \u201cnew cause of ac-\n tion,\u201d 142 F.3d at 1436, 1441\u201342.

See\n 142 F.3d at 1441\u201342 (\u201cThus, if the old law required proof of\n facts A, B, and C, and the new law requires proof of facts\n A, B, and D, a veteran who lost the A, B, C case under the\n old law because he could not establish C would seem free\n to claim under the new law, assuming he can establish A,\n B, and D.\u201d).\n     The Secretary suggests that there is a difference be-\n tween a fact as an element and evidence of such a fact. See\n Secretary Response Br. at 13\u201314. But Spencer and Routen\n do not elaborate such a distinction. Moreover, it remains\n true that the 2010 addition of \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) eliminated a\n crucial component of a veteran\u2019s affirmative case, whether\n the component is called evidence, fact, or an element, and\n that eliminating a corroboration requirement is more sub-\n stantive than procedural and, in a real-world sense, creates\n a new basis of entitlement. Section 3.304(f) itself, quoted\n above, in prescribing the elements of the veteran\u2019s case,\n pays little attention to the distinction between evidence\n and the fact evidenced, including a mix of the two catego-\n ries in its three requirements\u2014\u201cevidence diagnosing\n\n\n elimination of the corroboration requirement, so that the\n veteran\u2019s lay testimony suffices, id., anything other than\n liberalizing.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 24    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 24                                       ORTIZ   v.

See Vet. Aff. Op.\n Gen. Couns. Prec. 26-97 (\u201cBecause this change liberalized\n the evidentiary basis on which entitlement to a benefit\n could be established, it may be considered a substantive\n change providing a new basis for establishing entitlement\n to benefits and, consequently, a liberalizing VA issue for\n purposes of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a).\u201d (emphases added)); cf.\n Vet.

That matters because, notwithstanding\n Spencer and Routen, the Secretary agrees that such a pre-\n sumption is a liberalizing change.

A presumption itself is an \u201c[e]videntiary rule,\u201d which\n effectively \u201csupplies the required evidence\u201d when specified\n \u201cpreconditions are satisfied.\u201d Snyder v.

Section 3.304(f)(3) does the\n same. Presumptions are generally rebuttable on proof that\n meets a specified standard of convincingness. Routen, 142\n F.3d at 1440. Section 3.304(f)(3) states that the govern-\n ment can overcome the exception to the corroboration re-\n quirement when there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence to\n the contrary.\u201d\n     For those reasons, the 2010 addition of \u00a7 3.304(f)(3)\n fairly comes within the key formulations articulated in\n Spencer and Routen if those formulations are borrowed to\n define \u201cliberalizing.\u201d It established a new basis of entitle-\n ment by alleviating the substantive burden of presenting\n specified concrete evidence previously required of the vet-\n eran as part of the affirmative case. Although the court in\n Routen also used the phrase \u201cnew cause of action,\u201d 142 F.3d\n at 1436, 1441\u201342, it did not specify content for that phrase\n apart from the \u201cnew basis of entitlement\u201d and \u201csubstan-\n tive\u201d formulations. In fact, the Secretary argues here that\n those formulations state the standard of Spencer and\n Routen, without separate reference to \u201cnew cause of ac-\n tion.\u201d See Secretary Response Br. at 16 (\u201cAs explained\n above, a \u2018liberalizing law or VA issue\u2019 within the context of\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a) and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) is one that ef-\n fects a substantive change in law or regulation and creates\n a new basis for entitlement to a benefit. Routen, 142 F.3d\n at 1441\u201342; Spencer, 17 F.3d 368.\u201d). We conclude that\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) lies on the qualifying side of the line drawn (in\n answering a different question) in Spencer and Routen.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 26    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 26                                       ORTIZ   v.

The changes ruled on in those cases did not\n eliminate concrete components of the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n case for entitlement to particular benefits.\n      In Spencer, we rejected the contention that a set of gen-\n eral changes made by the VJRA created a new basis of en-\n titlement, concluding that the \u201creforms implemented by\n the VJRA were directed to improving the adjudicative pro-\n cess.\u201d 17 F.3d at 372. The opinion\u2019s focus was on the new\n availability of judicial review, but the court mentioned, as\n well, the provision that \u201c[w]hen there is an approximate\n balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any is-\n sue material to the determination of a matter, the Secre-\n tary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant,\u201d 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b). See Spencer, 17 F.3d at 372. Neither\n \u00a7 5107(b) nor the other measures invoked by the veteran in\n Spencer altered any particular component of the veteran\u2019s\n case. Even \u00a7 5107(b) is an across-the-board standard for\n how persuaded VA must be of whatever particular submis-\n sion the veteran makes. The Secretary here has made no\n argument specifically focused on \u00a7 5107(b), let alone one\n contending that it is relevantly similar to \u00a7 3.304(f)(3).\n     Routen likewise did not involve a concrete relaxation of\n a component of a veteran\u2019s affirmative case. Rather, it in-\n volved a heightening of the government\u2019s rebuttal burden\n in a particular situation. A regulation provided that, when\n a veteran claims disability based on aggravation during\n service of a preexisting injury, see 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (war-\n time service), \u00a7 1131 (peacetime service), all the veteran\n needed to show was a pre-service injury that worsened dur-\n ing service. The government could rebut the presumption\n that it was the service that aggravated the injury by show-\n ing that the worsening was the natural progression of the\n preexisting injury. For wartime veterans, the government\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34     Page: 27    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                      27\n\n\n\n had to make that showing by \u201cclear and unmistakable evi-\n dence,\u201d but for peacetime veterans, the government could\n make the showing by \u201cavailable evidence of a nature gen-\n erally acceptable as competent.\u201d 142 F.3d at 1438 (internal\n quotation marks omitted). The regulatory change at issue\n in Routen was VA\u2019s imposition on the government, for its\n rebuttal case involving aggravation claims of peacetime\n veterans, of the higher degree of persuasiveness (clear and\n unmistakable evidence) already imposed on the govern-\n ment for wartime veterans. Id.\n      It was that regulatory change Routen held not to qual-\n ify. That change did not alter the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n case at all. It altered only the government\u2019s rebuttal case\u2014\n and did so only at the general level of specifying how per-\n suasive the government\u2019s evidence must be, not by altering\n particular components of proof. Those features critically\n differ from the elimination of a proof element of a veteran\u2019s\n affirmative case that was effected by the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3).\n                              C\n      To the extent relevant, VA\u2019s statements in adopting the\n 2010 the Final Rule underscore the conclusion that\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) is liberalizing. In the Final Rule, VA recog-\n nized that the 2010 amendment effectively \u201celiminate[d]\u201d\n an evidentiary \u201crequirement\u201d when the specified precondi-\n tions were met. See 75 Fed.

To be sure, the Final Rule says\n that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) would \u201cfacilitate the timely processing of\n PTSD claims by simplifying the development and research\n procedures that apply to these claims.\u201d 75 Fed.

MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n TARANTO, Circuit Judge.\n     The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded vet-\n eran Geraldo Ortiz benefits for a service-connected disabil-\n ity based on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acting\n pursuant to a regulatory change that lightened his previ-\n ous evidentiary burden. The dispute before us concerns the\n starting date for the benefits awarded, i.e., the effective\n date of the award. We conclude that the regulatory change\n that enabled Mr. Ortiz to obtain the benefits was a \u201cliber-\n alizing\u201d one, entitling Mr. Ortiz to the earlier effective date,\n and hence the larger award, that he seeks.\n     Mr. Ortiz had first claimed service-connected disability\n benefits based on PTSD, under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110, in 1997.\n But VA denied the claim because Mr. Ortiz did not provide\n corroborating evidence, as required by the PTSD regula-\n tion, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f), that the events identified as lead-\n ing to his PTSD occurred in his military service. That\n decision became final. Years later, in 2010, the Secretary\n of Veterans Affairs amended \u00a7 3.304(f) by adding what is\n now subsection (f)(3) to state an exception to the corrobo-\n rating-evidence requirement in circumstances like those of\n Mr. Ortiz. On May 22, 2012, more than a year after the\n regulatory change took effect, Mr. Ortiz moved to reopen\n his claim, invoking the newly lightened proof requirement.\n Within months, VA reopened his claim and granted the\n claim, rating him 100 percent disabled and making the\n benefits effective as of May 22, 2012, the date VA received\n the request to reopen.\n     Mr. Ortiz contended that the effective date should have\n been one year earlier (May 22, 2011). For that contention,\n he relied on 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a), which implements 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) and provides that when compensation \u201cis\n awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a\n liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the\n Secretary\u2019s direction\u201d and the \u201cclaim [for compensation] is\n reviewed at the request of the claimant more than 1 year\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 3    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                         3\n\n\n\n after the effective date of the law or VA issue,\u201d the effective\n date is \u201c1 year prior to the date of receipt of such request.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a)(3). Mr. Ortiz argued that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3)\n was a \u201cliberalizing\u201d law or VA issue, entitling him to the\n extra year of benefits. The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals and\n then the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans\n Court) rejected his request for an earlier effective date.\n While accepting that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim was granted \u201cpursu-\n ant to\u201d \u00a7 3.304(f)(3), they concluded that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) was\n not a \u201cliberalizing\u201d measure.\n     We reverse.       We conclude that the addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) in 2010 was \u201cliberalizing\u201d under \u00a7 3.114(a). It\n is sufficient to come within \u00a7 3.114(a)\u2019s \u201cliberalizing\u201d cate-\n gory that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) reduced a veteran\u2019s affirmative bur-\n den of production to establish an element of entitlement to\n compensation. In these circumstances, the correct effective\n date for Mr. Ortiz\u2019s benefits is May 22, 2011, rather than\n May 22, 2012. 1\n                               I\n                               A\n     The precedents that the parties principally debate are\n Spencer v. Brown, 17 F.3d 368 (Fed. Cir. 1994), and Routen\n v. West, 142 F.3d 1434 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In those decisions,\n this court did not directly interpret and apply the effective-\n date \u201cliberalizing\u201d regulation at issue here, 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 3.114(a), to answer an effective-date question, as no such\n question was presented. Rather, the court relied on 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a) to draw an infer-\n ence about a circumstance in which a new original claim is\n not barred by the otherwise-governing statutory finality\n\n\n     1   Unless noted otherwise, all citations are to provi-\n sions as they existed before the Veterans Appeals Improve-\n ment and Modernization Act of 2017, Pub.

It\n is useful, therefore, to begin with a summary of the statu-\n tory and regulatory provisions that provide a general rule\n of finality for claim-rejecting VA decisions but allow for ex-\n ceptions, including the exception recognized in Spencer and\n Routen.\n     Statutes and regulations governing veterans benefits\n expressly state general rules of finality for VA decisions.\n That is so for a decision by a VA regional office (or agency\n of original jurisdiction) unless timely appealed to the\n Board. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(c) (\u201cIf no notice of disagree-\n ment is filed in accordance with this chapter within the\n prescribed period, the action or determination shall become\n final and the claim will not thereafter be reopened or al-\n lowed, except as may otherwise be provided by regulations\n not inconsistent with this title.\u201d); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 20.1104,\n 3.104(a), 3.2600. And it is also so for a Board decision un-\n less timely appealed to the Veterans Court. See 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7104(b) (\u201cExcept as provided in section 5108 of this title,\n when a claim is disallowed by the Board, the claim may not\n thereafter be reopened and allowed and a claim based upon\n the same factual basis may not be considered.\u201d); 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 20.1100.\n      As the above-quoted statutes make clear, however, ex-\n ceptions are authorized. One exception, not invoked in the\n present case, is for \u201cclear and unmistakable error\u201d in the\n original decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A(a), 7111; see also 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1400. A decision reversing or revising the ear-\n lier decision on that basis \u201chas the same effect as if the de-\n cision had been made on the date of the prior decision,\u201d 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5109A, 7111, so the effective date of an award of\n benefits previously \u201cdenied due to clear and unmistakable\n error\u201d is as early as \u201cthe veteran\u2019s filing of the original\n claim,\u201d Sears v. Principi, 349 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir.\n 2003); see also 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(k). A second exception,\n which was invoked in the present case, is for \u201creopening\u201d\n based on \u201cnew and material evidence.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108;\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 5    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

See Sears,\n 349 F.3d at 1331; 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(q)\u2013(r). 3\n     This court concluded in Spencer that, in Routen\u2019s\n words, there is also a \u201cthird\u201d path around an otherwise-fi-\n nal claim rejection\u2014namely, a new original claim\u2014if cer-\n tain statutory or agency-adopted changes have been made\n since the earlier rejection. Routen, 142 F.3d at 1438, 1442.\n The court in Spencer quoted with approval the Veterans\n Court\u2019s reasoning:\n     When a provision of law or regulation creates a new\n     basis of entitlement to benefits, as through liberal-\n     ization of the requirements for entitlement to a\n     benefit, an applicant\u2019s claim of entitlement under\n     such law or regulation is a claim separate and dis-\n     tinct from a claim previously and finally denied\n\n\n     2    Section 5108 now is titled \u201cSupplemental claims,\u201d\n uses the term \u201creadjudicate\u201d rather than \u201creopen,\u201d and re-\n quires \u201cnew and relevant\u201d instead of \u201cnew and material\u201d ev-\n idence. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108(a) (\u201cIn General.\u2014If new and\n relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a\n supplemental claim, the Secretary shall readjudicate the\n claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of rec-\n ord.\u201d); see also 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(a) (implementing \u00a7 5108).\n     3    A regulation provides for different effective-date\n treatment in defined circumstances when a claim is reo-\n pened and reconsidered based on \u201crelevant official service\n department records that existed and had not been associ-\n ated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(c)(1). In that situation, an award may\n have an effective date as early as \u201cthe date VA received the\n previously decided claim.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3.156(c)(3); see also Blub-\n augh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014);\n Loyd v. Shulkin, 682 F. App\u2019x 906, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 6    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n     prior to the liberalizing law or regulation. The ap-\n     plicant\u2019s later claim, asserting rights which did not\n     exist at the time of the prior claim, is necessarily a\n     different claim.\n Spencer, 17 F.3d at 372 (quoting Spencer v. Brown, 4 Vet.\n App. 283, 288\u201389 (1993) (Spencer CAVC); alteration and\n internal quotation marks omitted). This court agreed with\n the Veterans Court that the finality protection of \u00a7 7104(b)\n \u201c\u2018does not preclude de novo adjudication of a claim, on es-\n sentially the same facts as a previously and finally denied\n claim, where an intervening and substantive change in law\n or regulation created a new basis for entitlement to a ben-\n efit.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Spencer CAVC, 4 Vet. App. at 289).\n      In ruling that the statute allows a new original claim\n based on certain changes of law, notwithstanding the oth-\n erwise-prescribed finality of an earlier claim\u2019s rejection,\n this court and the Veterans Court in Spencer, as well as\n this court in Routen, relied on what they found to be a nec-\n essary implication of a statutory effective-date provision,\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g), implemented by 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a).\n Routen, 142 F.3d at 1441 (relying on statute and regula-\n tion); Spencer, 17 F.3d at 371 (relying on statute); Spencer\n CAVC, 4 Vet. App. at 287\u201389 (relying on statute and regu-\n lation). The decisions in those cases do not directly apply\n those provisions, which merely prescribe an effective date\n for certain awards of compensation; there was no effective-\n date issue in those cases because there were no awards in\n those cases at all. Rather, the courts in those cases dis-\n cerned in the effective-date statute (and regulation) an im-\n plied presupposition that a new original claim must\n sometimes be available, modifying the otherwise-applica-\n ble statutory (and regulatory) guarantees of finality of an\n earlier decision. The court in Routen itself stressed that\n very difference\u2014between direct application of the effective-\n date provisions (which was not at issue) and the scope of\n an implied statutory modification to allow a new original\n claim (which was). See 142 F.3d at 1441.\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 7    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

Addressing a change-of-law situation, it provides\n that, \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of section 5101\u201d (concern-\n ing \u201cclaims and forms\u201d),\n     where compensation . . . is awarded or increased\n     pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the ef-\n     fective date of such award or increase shall be fixed\n     in accordance with the facts found but shall not be\n     earlier than the effective date of the Act or admin-\n     istrative issue. In no event shall such award or in-\n     crease be retroactive for more than one year from\n     the date of application therefor or the date of ad-\n     ministrative determination of entitlement, which-\n     ever is earlier.\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g). The language is not limited to recon-\n sideration of a claim, but reaches an original claim. And it\n applies not just where \u201ccompensation . . . is awarded\u201d\n (where no compensation had previously been awarded) but\n also where \u201ccompensation . . . is . . . increased\u201d (where, for\n example, a rating is increased).\n     A regulation, also dating back to 1962, implements that\n statutory subsection. Under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114, titled\n \u201cChange of law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue,\u201d\n subsection (a) provides:\n     (a) Effective date of award. Where . . . compensa-\n     tion . . . is awarded or increased pursuant to a lib-\n     eralizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved\n     by the Secretary or by the Secretary\u2019s direction, the\n     effective date of such award or increase shall be\n     fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 8    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n     not be earlier than the effective date of the act or\n     administrative issue. Where . . . compensation . . .\n     is awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing\n     law or VA issue which became effective on or after\n     the date of its enactment or issuance, in order for a\n     claimant to be eligible for a retroactive payment\n     under the provisions of this paragraph the evidence\n     must show that the claimant met all eligibility cri-\n     teria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date\n     of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such\n     eligibility existed continuously from that date to\n     the date of claim or administrative determination\n     of entitlement. The provisions of this paragraph\n     are applicable to original and reopened claims as\n     well as claims for increase.\n         (1) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of\n         VA within 1 year from the effective date of\n         the law or VA issue, or at the request of a\n         claimant received within 1 year from that\n         date, benefits may be authorized from the\n         effective date of the law or VA issue.\n         (2) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of\n         VA more than 1 year after the effective date\n         of the law or VA issue, benefits may be au-\n         thorized for a period of 1 year prior to the\n         date of administrative determination of en-\n         titlement.\n         (3) If a claim is reviewed at the request of\n         the claimant more than 1 year after the ef-\n         fective date of the law or VA issue, benefits\n         may be authorized for a period of 1 year\n         prior to the date of receipt of such request.\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 9    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

The regulation expressly applies to\n \u201coriginal and reopened claims as well as claims for in-\n crease.\u201d Id. 4\n     There is dispute about what the consequences are for\n the effective date of an award when, on a claim that has\n been reopened, the award is made \u201cpursuant to\u201d a \u201cliberal-\n izing\u201d change. In that situation, the award\u2019s effective date\n may not be earlier than the effective date of the underlying\n change, but it may be as early as one year before the re-\n quest based on the change was made. See McCay v. Brown,\n 106 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The issue in this case\n is whether \u00a7 3.114(a) applies to a particular regulatory\n change.\n                               C\n      Mr. Ortiz served during the Vietnam era, a \u201cperiod of\n war,\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(f), within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1110, which provides for compensation for service-con-\n nected disability\u2014specifically, \u201c[f]or disability resulting\n from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line\n of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered\n or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military,\n naval, or air service, during a period of war\u201d\u2014subject to\n exceptions that do not apply here. It is undisputed before\n us that, having earlier denied Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim for disabil-\n ity benefits based on PTSD, VA reopened Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim\n for such benefits and granted the claim in 2012 and that\n VA did so pursuant to the 2010 addition of what is now\n subsection (f)(3) to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304. There is no dispute\n about the propriety of the reopening or the grant. The only\n question presented concerns the proper effective date un-\n der 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a), and the only issue in dispute about\n\n\n\n     4  Amended to implement the statutory changes from\n the Modernization Act, the regulation now reads \u201coriginal\n and supplemental claims as well as claims for increase.\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 10    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                        ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n the applicability of \u00a7 3.114(a) is whether the 2010 adoption\n of what is now \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) was a \u201cliberalizing\u201d change un-\n der \u00a7 3.114(a). The proper resolution depends on the regu-\n lations governing PTSD-based claims for service-connected\n disability benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110.\n      To secure benefits under \u00a7 1110 (or under \u00a7 1131,\n which governs peacetime service), a veteran generally\n must \u201csatisfy a three-element test: (1) the existence of a\n present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation\n of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between\n the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or\n aggravated during service\u2014the so-called \u2018nexus\u2019 require-\n ment.\u201d Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir.\n 2013). Congress prescribed in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a) that the\n Secretary must provide, in regulations governing service\n connection, for consideration of various facts and types of\n evidence. For \u201cany veteran who engaged in combat with\n the enemy in active service,\u201d Congress added, in \u00a7 1154(b),\n that \u201cthe Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of ser-\n vice-connection . . . satisfactory lay or other evidence of ser-\n vice incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease, if\n consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships\n of such service . . . .

And VA itself stated\n that it granted the claim \u201cbecause [it] conceded that [Mr.\n Ortiz] experienced fear due to hostile military or terrorist\n activity while serving in Vietnam and because the VA ex-\n aminer related [his] diagnosis of PTSD to that fear,\u201d which\n was now enough because new \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) \u201crelaxed the ev-\n identiary standard for establishing the required in-service\n stressor\u201d for claims based on PTSD. J.A. 40; see also J.A.\n 40 (New \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) \u201celiminated the requirement for cor-\n roborating evidence.\u201d); J.A. 42 (\u201cEasing Standard\u201d).\n                               D\n      The only dispute before us is whether \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) was\n a \u201cliberalizing\u201d change under \u00a7 3.114(a). The regional of-\n fice concluded that it was not. J.A. 40, 103. The Board\n reached the same conclusion, after \u201cacknowledg[ing] that\n the Veteran\u2019s service connection claim for PTSD was ulti-\n mately granted pursuant to an amended PTSD regulation.\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 14   Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 14                                      ORTIZ   v.

The Veterans Court then af-\n firmed: It accepted the Board\u2019s determination that Mr.\n Ortiz\u2019s \u201cclaim was granted based on [the 2010] change in\n VA\u2019s regulations addressing establishing an in-service\n stressor,\u201d but it concluded that it was bound by its Foreman\n precedent.

We have jurisdiction under\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292 to review the Veterans Court\u2019s ruling be-\n cause whether \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) made a \u201cliberalizing\u201d change\n within the meaning of \u00a7 3.114(a) presents a question of law.\n See Spencer, 17 F.3d at 372.\n                              II\n      We conclude that the addition of \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) made a\n \u201cliberalizing\u201d change under \u00a7 3.114(a). We decide the issue\n without applying the deference doctrine of Auer v. Robbins,\n 519 U.S. 452 (1997), as clarified in Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S.\n Ct. 2400 (2019). Although we doubt that the doctrine\n would apply to the question presented, we need not decide\n the doctrine\u2019s applicability, or whether our answer to the\n legal question is a matter of unambiguous meaning (mak-\n ing the doctrine immaterial), because the Secretary does\n not invoke the doctrine.

This general meaning was common at the\n time of \u00a7 3.114(a)\u2019s promulgation and the 2010 amendment\n to \u00a7 3.304, and it remains common now. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s\n Third New International Dictionary 1303 (1961) (\u201cto make\n less strict or rigorous\u201d); The American College Dictionary\n 702 (1962) (\u201cto make or become more liberal,\u201d i.e., \u201cnot\n strict or rigorous\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary 727\n (2d College ed. 1982) (similar); Oxford English Dictionary\n (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cto free from narrowness\u201d and \u201c[t]o remove\n restrictions on\u201d); The American Heritage Dictionary of the\n English Language 1036\u201337 (3d ed. 1992) (\u201cTo make liberal\n or more liberal,\u201d i.e., \u201c[n]ot strict\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n 1057 (10th ed. 2009) (\u201cTo make a system, laws, policies, or\n moral attitudes less strict, censorious, and rhadaman-\n thine.\u201d); Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. 2010) (\u201cto free\n from narrowness or strictness; to relax\u201d); see also, e.g., S.\n Rep.

Before the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3), the legal standard governing a claim of PTSD-\n based disability in Mr. Ortiz\u2019s circumstances required cor-\n roborating evidence, beyond the veteran\u2019s own testimony,\n to confirm the in-service occurrence of the asserted\n stressor. The 2010 change eliminated that requirement of\n the affirmative case for veterans like Mr. Ortiz. The re-\n quirements for affirmatively showing entitlement, in short,\n became less strict. See Sanchez-Navarro, 774 F.3d at 1384\n (Section \u201c3.304(f)(3) applies a more relaxed standard\u201d than\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 16    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 16                                       ORTIZ   v.

For good reason: Be-\n fore the change, Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim was rejected, whereas af-\n ter the change, it was granted undisputedly because of the\n elimination of a concrete component of what he was previ-\n ously required to show in his affirmative case for entitle-\n ment to an award.\n      In fact, the 2010 change is a prototypical example of a\n \u201cliberalizing\u201d change resulting in an \u201caward.\u201d Cf. McBoyle\n v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.) (rely-\n ing on the idea of a \u201cpicture\u201d \u201cevoke[d] in the common\n mind\u201d). The term \u201cliberalizing\u201d when used with \u201claw\u201d and\n \u201cVA issue\u201d in the context of a \u201cclaim\u201d most naturally covers\n a relaxation of a claimant\u2019s affirmative burden. That is ex-\n actly what the 2010 change does. A veteran generally has\n the affirmative burden of production to establish the ele-\n ments of a claim of entitlement (though VA has a duty to\n assist). See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise pro-\n vided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present\n and support a claim for benefits under laws administered\n by the Secretary.\u201d); id. \u00a7 5103A (duty to assist); 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 3.159 (implementing \u00a7 5103A). The 2010 amendment\n changed concrete components of what VA must consider\n \u201csufficient proof,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b), to establish an ele-\n ment of entitlement, so it relaxed the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n responsibility in presenting and supporting a claim for ben-\n efits.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 17     Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                        17\n\n\n\n      This meaning fits the context of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g)\n and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a). Those provisions provide up to\n one extra year of benefits when an award has been made\n or increased pursuant to a qualifying \u201c[c]hange of law or\n [VA] issue\u201d (\u00a7 3.114(a) title)\u2014allowing veterans a brief ex-\n tra period to become aware and to take advantage of a\n change that newly entitles them to an award or an increase\n of compensation. The ordinary meaning of \u201cliberalizing\u201d is\n not in any way out of place in that context. When Congress\n enacted the provision now codified as \u00a7 5110(g), the con-\n gressional committees, using the language of \u201cliberalizing,\u201d\n explained: \u201cClaimants who have no knowledge of the bene-\n fits or are not identified by [VA] . . . may be penalized by\n not filing promptly.\u201d S. Rep. No. 87-2041, at 6; H. Rep. No.\n 87-2123 at 6 (same). Applying the term\u2019s ordinary meaning\n mitigates the delay penalty.\n                               B\n      The Secretary nevertheless argues that we should not\n apply the ordinary meaning of \u201cliberalizing\u201d here, resting\n that argument entirely on Spencer and Routen. For two\n independent reasons, however, we reject the argument.\n First, neither Spencer nor Routen actually decided the is-\n sue of what changes suffice to trigger application of the reg-\n ulation (or, for that matter, of the statute) to give a veteran\n the earlier effective date. They decided a different issue:\n what the implications of the statute (and regulation) are\n for the availability of a new original claim that, outside the\n statutory reconsideration paths, avoids the otherwise-ap-\n plicable statutory bar based on a previous final rejection of\n a veteran\u2019s earlier claim. Second, the change in the present\n case materially differs from the particular changes that the\n court in Spencer and Routen held insufficient to allow a\n new original claim. We conclude not only that the two prec-\n edents provide no persuasive basis for rejecting the ordi-\n nary-meaning application of \u201cliberalizing\u201d to cover\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) but also that, even if the formulations used by\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 18    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 18                                       ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n Spencer and Routen are borrowed to define \u201cliberalizing,\u201d\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) qualifies.\n                               1\n      Unlike this case, neither Spencer nor Routen involved\n an effective-date issue, so in neither case did this court di-\n rectly apply 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a) or decide what \u201cliberaliz-\n ing\u201d means in identifying a change of law or VA issue that\n qualifies for the earlier effective date of an award. Indeed,\n unlike this case\u2014where the claim was reopened and there\n is no dispute about the propriety of that reopening (or grant\n of the claim)\u2014neither Spencer nor Routen involved a claim\n that was reopened under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108. The portions of\n both decisions on which the Secretary relies involve only\n whether a new original claim was available because of the\n asserted change of law or regulation.\n     In Spencer, the veteran had filed a claim for benefits\n based on his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. 17 F.3d at 370.\n The regional office denied his claim because he failed to\n provide sufficient evidence that \u201cthe disability was in-\n curred in or aggravated by his service in the military.\u201d Id.\n The regional office\u2019s decision became final. Years later, the\n veteran sought both to reopen his finally decided claim be-\n cause of new and material evidence and to have his claim\n considered as a new original claim because there was an\n \u201cintervening change in law,\u201d namely the passage of the Vet-\n erans\u2019 Judicial Review Act of 1988 (VJRA). Id. at 371\u201373.\n The Board, and then the Veterans Court, determined that\n the veteran\u2019s claim warranted neither reopening nor fresh\n consideration. Id. at 370\u201371.\n     We agreed. As to the denial of reopening for want of\n new and material evidence, we concluded that we lacked\n jurisdiction to address it, for reasons not pertinent to the\n issue now before us in this case. See id. at 373\u201374. The\n veteran\u2019s right to proceed therefore depended on whether\n he had available a new original claim. We adopted the Vet-\n erans Court\u2019s conclusion, as quoted above, that \u00a7 5110(g),\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34     Page: 19    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                      19\n\n\n\n though not directly authorizing a new avenue for reconsid-\n eration of a final decision, implicitly presupposes that\n sometimes a change of law or regulation can support the\n availability of a new original claim; but we recognized that\n such availability requires a modification of the express\n statutory protection of finality, notably that of \u00a7 7104, and\n the limited express statutory provisions for reconsidera-\n tion. Id. at 371\u201372; Spencer CAVC, 4 Vet. App. at 287\u201389.\n It was in harmonizing express statutory commands (final-\n ity, with two limited paths around finality) with an impli-\n cation from another statutory provision directed at another\n issue (effective dates) that we decided that a new original\n claim requires \u201ca new basis of entitlement to a claimed ben-\n efit as the result of an intervening change in law or regula-\n tion.\u201d Spencer, 17 F.3d at 373. And we held that the\n generic VJRA changes on which the veteran relied did not\n meet that standard because they \u201cwere unmistakably pro-\n cedural in nature\u201d and thus did not \u201csubstantively affect[]\n the nature\u201d of the finally decided claim. Id. at 372\u201373.\n     Routen involved a materially identical posture. In that\n case, the veteran\u2019s claim had been denied in a final decision\n before the relevant regulatory change. 142 F.3d at 1436\u2013\n 37. After the regulatory change (concerning the govern-\n ment\u2019s rebuttal burden on in-service aggravation of a\n preexisting injury), the veteran sought to reopen his claim\n based on new and material evidence and to have his claim\n considered de novo as a new original claim. Id. The re-\n gional office declined to reopen the veteran\u2019s claim for new\n and material evidence and did not consider the claim a new\n original claim. Id. The Board and the Veterans Court\n again agreed with the regional office. Id.\n     So did we. As to the denial of reopening, we determined\n that a \u201cpresumption\u201d is not itself new and material evi-\n dence. Id. at 1439\u201341. As to the new-original-claim issue,\n we concluded that the relevant regulatory amendment was\n insufficient to support allowing the claim as a new original\n one. Id. at 1441\u201342. We recognized that the issue was one\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 20    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 20                                       ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n of seeking to harmonize the express statutory finality prin-\n ciple of \u00a7 7104 with an implied presupposition found in\n \u00a7 5110(g) (and its implementing regulation), where neither\n of the two express statutory authorizations for reconsider-\n ation (clear and unmistakable error, and reopening) was\n applicable. Routen, 142 F.3d at 1442 (emphasizing that\n \u201cthe logic of the intervening change rule, if it is to escape\n the bar of \u00a7 7104(b), must be that the intervening change\n in law creates a new cause of action\u201d). And we held that\n changing the government\u2019s rebuttal burden (newly to re-\n quire clear and unmistakable evidence) was a \u201cprocedural\u201d\n one, and made no \u201csubstantive change\u201d in what the veteran\n had to show to be entitled to an award, and thus did not\n support recognition of a new original claim. Id.\n      Spencer and Routen therefore involved only the ques-\n tion of how far express statutory provisions\u2014the statutory\n finality bar, subject to only limited express statutory routes\n for reconsideration\u2014had to be deemed implicitly modified\n by \u00a7 5110(g) and its implementing regulation, which ad-\n dress only the effective date of an award for which the stat-\n ute elsewhere provides express authority. That is not the\n question here. In this case, there is no question of modify-\n ing an express statutory means for reconsideration: It is\n undisputed before us that one of the express means (reo-\n pening based on new and material evidence) was properly\n used. The only question here is the proper application of\n the effective-date prescription (\u00a7 5110(g) as implemented\n by \u00a7 3.114(a)) in a matter that undisputedly fell within an\n express statutory avenue of reconsideration. That question\n did not arise in Spencer and Routen, and unlike the ques-\n tion answered in those cases, the question here does not\n present any facial conflict with other express legal con-\n straints whose modification must be minimized. Routen it-\n self recognized that the questions are distinct. 142 F.3d at\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 21    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

Spencer and Routen do not control the resolution\n of the issue here. And the Secretary has given no sound\n reason that the questions in those cases and the question\n in this case must have the same answer. Relying only on\n Spencer and Routen, which we conclude do not control, the\n Secretary has furnished no reason that interpretation of\n the regulation at issue, \u00a7 3.114, should depart from its or-\n dinary meaning\u2014which makes sense in context and under\n\n\n\n\n     7    The distinction is reinforced by the fact that the\n statute (\u00a7 5110(g)) and the regulation (\u00a7 3.114(a)) include\n changes that result in an \u201cincrease\u201d of an already granted\n award, yet the court in Routen spoke of a \u201cnew cause of ac-\n tion,\u201d 142 F.3d at 1436, 1441\u201342. Although the court in\n Routen did not give a specific meaning to that phrase dif-\n ferent from the \u201csubstantive,\u201d \u201cnew basis of entitlement\u201d\n language that it (and the court in Spencer) used, that lan-\n guage would be odd as a label for a change (covered by\n \u00a7 5110(g) and \u00a7 3.114(a)) that simply increases amounts of\n compensation, as by providing for a higher rating than the\n one the same facts previously supported. Cf. Vet. Aff. Op.\n Gen. Couns.

After the 2010 ad-\n dition, the \u201ccredible supporting evidence\u201d requirement\u2014a\n requirement of corroboration\u2014no longer applies for those\n in Mr. Ortiz\u2019s position. Specifically, \u201cthe veteran\u2019s lay tes-\n timony\u201d suffices if certain preconditions are met (and the\n government does not provide clear and convincing contrary\n evidence). 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f)(3). 8 The 2010 change thus\n\n\n      8  The provision added in 2010 requires satisfaction\n of certain preconditions, such as confirmation from speci-\n fied psychiatrist or psychologist that \u201cthe claimed stressor\n is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD]\u201d and con-\n sistency of the stressor with the veteran\u2019s service. 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f)(3). The Secretary, which agrees that the\n 2010 provision is less strict than the predecessor version,\n has not shown that these preconditions make the\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34     Page: 23   Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

It is also fairly\n described as more than \u201cprocedural.\u201d Id.; see also Carmell\n v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 544\u201345 (2000) (concluding that an\n elimination of a corroboration requirement went to the\n \u201csufficiency of the evidence . . . for meeting the burden of\n proof\u201d and thus was not a \u201cmode[] of procedure\u201d). In fact,\n the court in Routen suggested that something materially\n similar, if not identical, would meet its own standard. See\n 142 F.3d at 1441\u201342 (\u201cThus, if the old law required proof of\n facts A, B, and C, and the new law requires proof of facts\n A, B, and D, a veteran who lost the A, B, C case under the\n old law because he could not establish C would seem free\n to claim under the new law, assuming he can establish A,\n B, and D.\u201d).\n     The Secretary suggests that there is a difference be-\n tween a fact as an element and evidence of such a fact. See\n Secretary Response Br. at 13\u201314. But Spencer and Routen\n do not elaborate such a distinction. Moreover, it remains\n true that the 2010 addition of \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) eliminated a\n crucial component of a veteran\u2019s affirmative case, whether\n the component is called evidence, fact, or an element, and\n that eliminating a corroboration requirement is more sub-\n stantive than procedural and, in a real-world sense, creates\n a new basis of entitlement. Section 3.304(f) itself, quoted\n above, in prescribing the elements of the veteran\u2019s case,\n pays little attention to the distinction between evidence\n and the fact evidenced, including a mix of the two catego-\n ries in its three requirements\u2014\u201cevidence diagnosing\n\n\n elimination of the corroboration requirement, so that the\n veteran\u2019s lay testimony suffices, id., anything other than\n liberalizing.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 24    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 24                                       ORTIZ   v.

See Vet. Aff. Op.\n Gen. Couns. Prec. 26-97 (\u201cBecause this change liberalized\n the evidentiary basis on which entitlement to a benefit\n could be established, it may be considered a substantive\n change providing a new basis for establishing entitlement\n to benefits and, consequently, a liberalizing VA issue for\n purposes of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a).\u201d (emphases added)); cf.\n Vet. Aff. Op. Gen. Couns. Prec. 9-92 (opining that \u201c[w]here\n an increased rating is occasioned only by revision of criteria\n for rating psychoneurotic disorders which became effective\n February 3, 1988, the increased rating is to be considered\n based on a liberalizing VA issue per 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g)\n and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114,\u201d even though the elements to grant\n the claim remained unchanged).\n     In relevant respects, the 2010 change is akin to a crea-\n tion of a presumption that, when certain preconditions are\n met, a crucial element of a service-connection case is pre-\n sumed proved. That matters because, notwithstanding\n Spencer and Routen, the Secretary agrees that such a pre-\n sumption is a liberalizing change.

Cir. 2002) (accepting that a\n creation of a presumption is liberalizing).\n      Section 3.304(f)(3) is materially similar to a presump-\n tion. A presumption itself is an \u201c[e]videntiary rule,\u201d which\n effectively \u201csupplies the required evidence\u201d when specified\n \u201cpreconditions are satisfied.\u201d Snyder v. McDonough, 1\n F.4th 996, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Routen, 142 F.3d\n at 1440 (\u201cWhen the predicate evidence is established that\n triggers the presumption, the further evidentiary gap is\n filled by the presumption.\u201d). Section 3.304(f)(3) does the\n same. Presumptions are generally rebuttable on proof that\n meets a specified standard of convincingness. Routen, 142\n F.3d at 1440. Section 3.304(f)(3) states that the govern-\n ment can overcome the exception to the corroboration re-\n quirement when there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence to\n the contrary.\u201d\n     For those reasons, the 2010 addition of \u00a7 3.304(f)(3)\n fairly comes within the key formulations articulated in\n Spencer and Routen if those formulations are borrowed to\n define \u201cliberalizing.\u201d It established a new basis of entitle-\n ment by alleviating the substantive burden of presenting\n specified concrete evidence previously required of the vet-\n eran as part of the affirmative case. Although the court in\n Routen also used the phrase \u201cnew cause of action,\u201d 142 F.3d\n at 1436, 1441\u201342, it did not specify content for that phrase\n apart from the \u201cnew basis of entitlement\u201d and \u201csubstan-\n tive\u201d formulations. In fact, the Secretary argues here that\n those formulations state the standard of Spencer and\n Routen, without separate reference to \u201cnew cause of ac-\n tion.\u201d See Secretary Response Br. at 16 (\u201cAs explained\n above, a \u2018liberalizing law or VA issue\u2019 within the context of\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a) and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) is one that ef-\n fects a substantive change in law or regulation and creates\n a new basis for entitlement to a benefit. Routen, 142 F.3d\n at 1441\u201342; Spencer, 17 F.3d 368.\u201d). We conclude that\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) lies on the qualifying side of the line drawn (in\n answering a different question) in Spencer and Routen.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 26    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 26                                       ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n                               b\n     Spencer and Routen, on their facts, also did not involve\n changes like those made by the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3). The changes ruled on in those cases did not\n eliminate concrete components of the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n case for entitlement to particular benefits.\n      In Spencer, we rejected the contention that a set of gen-\n eral changes made by the VJRA created a new basis of en-\n titlement, concluding that the \u201creforms implemented by\n the VJRA were directed to improving the adjudicative pro-\n cess.\u201d 17 F.3d at 372. The opinion\u2019s focus was on the new\n availability of judicial review, but the court mentioned, as\n well, the provision that \u201c[w]hen there is an approximate\n balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any is-\n sue material to the determination of a matter, the Secre-\n tary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant,\u201d 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b). See Spencer, 17 F.3d at 372. Neither\n \u00a7 5107(b) nor the other measures invoked by the veteran in\n Spencer altered any particular component of the veteran\u2019s\n case. Even \u00a7 5107(b) is an across-the-board standard for\n how persuaded VA must be of whatever particular submis-\n sion the veteran makes. The Secretary here has made no\n argument specifically focused on \u00a7 5107(b), let alone one\n contending that it is relevantly similar to \u00a7 3.304(f)(3).\n     Routen likewise did not involve a concrete relaxation of\n a component of a veteran\u2019s affirmative case. Rather, it in-\n volved a heightening of the government\u2019s rebuttal burden\n in a particular situation. A regulation provided that, when\n a veteran claims disability based on aggravation during\n service of a preexisting injury, see 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (war-\n time service), \u00a7 1131 (peacetime service), all the veteran\n needed to show was a pre-service injury that worsened dur-\n ing service. The government could rebut the presumption\n that it was the service that aggravated the injury by show-\n ing that the worsening was the natural progression of the\n preexisting injury. For wartime veterans, the government\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34     Page: 27    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                      27\n\n\n\n had to make that showing by \u201cclear and unmistakable evi-\n dence,\u201d but for peacetime veterans, the government could\n make the showing by \u201cavailable evidence of a nature gen-\n erally acceptable as competent.\u201d 142 F.3d at 1438 (internal\n quotation marks omitted). The regulatory change at issue\n in Routen was VA\u2019s imposition on the government, for its\n rebuttal case involving aggravation claims of peacetime\n veterans, of the higher degree of persuasiveness (clear and\n unmistakable evidence) already imposed on the govern-\n ment for wartime veterans. Id.\n      It was that regulatory change Routen held not to qual-\n ify. That change did not alter the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n case at all. It altered only the government\u2019s rebuttal case\u2014\n and did so only at the general level of specifying how per-\n suasive the government\u2019s evidence must be, not by altering\n particular components of proof. Those features critically\n differ from the elimination of a proof element of a veteran\u2019s\n affirmative case that was effected by the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3).\n                              C\n      To the extent relevant, VA\u2019s statements in adopting the\n 2010 the Final Rule underscore the conclusion that\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) is liberalizing. In the Final Rule, VA recog-\n nized that the 2010 amendment effectively \u201celiminate[d]\u201d\n an evidentiary \u201crequirement\u201d when the specified precondi-\n tions were met. See 75 Fed.

To be sure, the Final Rule says\n that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) would \u201cfacilitate the timely processing of\n PTSD claims by simplifying the development and research\n procedures that apply to these claims.\u201d 75 Fed.

MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n TARANTO, Circuit Judge.\n     The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded vet-\n eran Geraldo Ortiz benefits for a service-connected disabil-\n ity based on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acting\n pursuant to a regulatory change that lightened his previ-\n ous evidentiary burden. The dispute before us concerns the\n starting date for the benefits awarded, i.e., the effective\n date of the award. We conclude that the regulatory change\n that enabled Mr. Ortiz to obtain the benefits was a \u201cliber-\n alizing\u201d one, entitling Mr. Ortiz to the earlier effective date,\n and hence the larger award, that he seeks.\n     Mr. Ortiz had first claimed service-connected disability\n benefits based on PTSD, under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110, in 1997.\n But VA denied the claim because Mr. Ortiz did not provide\n corroborating evidence, as required by the PTSD regula-\n tion, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.304(f), that the events identified as lead-\n ing to his PTSD occurred in his military service. That\n decision became final. Years later, in 2010, the Secretary\n of Veterans Affairs amended \u00a7 3.304(f) by adding what is\n now subsection (f)(3) to state an exception to the corrobo-\n rating-evidence requirement in circumstances like those of\n Mr. Ortiz. On May 22, 2012, more than a year after the\n regulatory change took effect, Mr. Ortiz moved to reopen\n his claim, invoking the newly lightened proof requirement.\n Within months, VA reopened his claim and granted the\n claim, rating him 100 percent disabled and making the\n benefits effective as of May 22, 2012, the date VA received\n the request to reopen.\n     Mr. Ortiz contended that the effective date should have\n been one year earlier (May 22, 2011). For that contention,\n he relied on 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a), which implements 38\n U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g) and provides that when compensation \u201cis\n awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a\n liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the\n Secretary\u2019s direction\u201d and the \u201cclaim [for compensation] is\n reviewed at the request of the claimant more than 1 year\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 3    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                         3\n\n\n\n after the effective date of the law or VA issue,\u201d the effective\n date is \u201c1 year prior to the date of receipt of such request.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a)(3). Mr. Ortiz argued that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3)\n was a \u201cliberalizing\u201d law or VA issue, entitling him to the\n extra year of benefits. The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals and\n then the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans\n Court) rejected his request for an earlier effective date.\n While accepting that Mr. Ortiz\u2019s claim was granted \u201cpursu-\n ant to\u201d \u00a7 3.304(f)(3), they concluded that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) was\n not a \u201cliberalizing\u201d measure.\n     We reverse.       We conclude that the addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) in 2010 was \u201cliberalizing\u201d under \u00a7 3.114(a). It\n is sufficient to come within \u00a7 3.114(a)\u2019s \u201cliberalizing\u201d cate-\n gory that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) reduced a veteran\u2019s affirmative bur-\n den of production to establish an element of entitlement to\n compensation.

Addressing a change-of-law situation, it provides\n that, \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of section 5101\u201d (concern-\n ing \u201cclaims and forms\u201d),\n     where compensation . . . is awarded or increased\n     pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the ef-\n     fective date of such award or increase shall be fixed\n     in accordance with the facts found but shall not be\n     earlier than the effective date of the Act or admin-\n     istrative issue. In no event shall such award or in-\n     crease be retroactive for more than one year from\n     the date of application therefor or the date of ad-\n     ministrative determination of entitlement, which-\n     ever is earlier.\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g). The language is not limited to recon-\n sideration of a claim, but reaches an original claim. And it\n applies not just where \u201ccompensation . . . is awarded\u201d\n (where no compensation had previously been awarded) but\n also where \u201ccompensation . . . is . . . increased\u201d (where, for\n example, a rating is increased).\n     A regulation, also dating back to 1962, implements that\n statutory subsection. Under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114, titled\n \u201cChange of law or Department of Veterans Affairs issue,\u201d\n subsection (a) provides:\n     (a) Effective date of award. Where . . . compensa-\n     tion . . . is awarded or increased pursuant to a lib-\n     eralizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved\n     by the Secretary or by the Secretary\u2019s direction, the\n     effective date of such award or increase shall be\n     fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34      Page: 8    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                        ORTIZ   v.

Where . . . compensation . . .\n     is awarded or increased pursuant to a liberalizing\n     law or VA issue which became effective on or after\n     the date of its enactment or issuance, in order for a\n     claimant to be eligible for a retroactive payment\n     under the provisions of this paragraph the evidence\n     must show that the claimant met all eligibility cri-\n     teria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date\n     of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such\n     eligibility existed continuously from that date to\n     the date of claim or administrative determination\n     of entitlement. The provisions of this paragraph\n     are applicable to original and reopened claims as\n     well as claims for increase.\n         (1) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of\n         VA within 1 year from the effective date of\n         the law or VA issue, or at the request of a\n         claimant received within 1 year from that\n         date, benefits may be authorized from the\n         effective date of the law or VA issue.\n         (2) If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of\n         VA more than 1 year after the effective date\n         of the law or VA issue, benefits may be au-\n         thorized for a period of 1 year prior to the\n         date of administrative determination of en-\n         titlement.\n         (3) If a claim is reviewed at the request of\n         the claimant more than 1 year after the ef-\n         fective date of the law or VA issue, benefits\n         may be authorized for a period of 1 year\n         prior to the date of receipt of such request.\n\fCase: 20-1911     Document: 34     Page: 9    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v.

Before the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3), the legal standard governing a claim of PTSD-\n based disability in Mr. Ortiz\u2019s circumstances required cor-\n roborating evidence, beyond the veteran\u2019s own testimony,\n to confirm the in-service occurrence of the asserted\n stressor. The 2010 change eliminated that requirement of\n the affirmative case for veterans like Mr. Ortiz. The re-\n quirements for affirmatively showing entitlement, in short,\n became less strict.

McBoyle\n v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101695\"><a href=\"/opinion/101695/mcboyle-v-united-states/\">283 U.S. 25</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.) (rely-\n ing on the idea of a \u201cpicture\u201d \u201cevoke[d] in the common\n mind\u201d). The term \u201cliberalizing\u201d when used with \u201claw\u201d and\n \u201cVA issue\u201d in the context of a \u201cclaim\u201d most naturally covers\n a relaxation of a claimant\u2019s affirmative burden. That is ex-\n actly what the 2010 change does. A veteran generally has\n the affirmative burden of production to establish the ele-\n ments of a claim of entitlement (though VA has a duty to\n assist). See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise pro-\n vided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present\n and support a claim for benefits under laws administered\n by the Secretary.\u201d); id. \u00a7 5103A (duty to assist); 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 3.159 (implementing \u00a7 5103A). The 2010 amendment\n changed concrete components of what VA must consider\n \u201csufficient proof,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(b), to establish an ele-\n ment of entitlement, so it relaxed the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n responsibility in presenting and supporting a claim for ben-\n efits.\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 17     Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n ORTIZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                        17\n\n\n\n      This meaning fits the context of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(g)\n and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.114(a). Those provisions provide up to\n one extra year of benefits when an award has been made\n or increased pursuant to a qualifying \u201c[c]hange of law or\n [VA] issue\u201d (\u00a7 3.114(a) title)\u2014allowing veterans a brief ex-\n tra period to become aware and to take advantage of a\n change that newly entitles them to an award or an increase\n of compensation. The ordinary meaning of \u201cliberalizing\u201d is\n not in any way out of place in that context. When Congress\n enacted the provision now codified as \u00a7 5110(g), the con-\n gressional committees, using the language of \u201cliberalizing,\u201d\n explained: \u201cClaimants who have no knowledge of the bene-\n fits or are not identified by [VA] . . . may be penalized by\n not filing promptly.\u201d S. Rep. No. 87-2041, at 6; H. Rep. No.\n 87-2123 at 6 (same). Applying the term\u2019s ordinary meaning\n mitigates the delay penalty.\n                               B\n      The Secretary nevertheless argues that we should not\n apply the ordinary meaning of \u201cliberalizing\u201d here, resting\n that argument entirely on Spencer and Routen. For two\n independent reasons, however, we reject the argument.\n First, neither Spencer nor Routen actually decided the is-\n sue of what changes suffice to trigger application of the reg-\n ulation (or, for that matter, of the statute) to give a veteran\n the earlier effective date. They decided a different issue:\n what the implications of the statute (and regulation) are\n for the availability of a new original claim that, outside the\n statutory reconsideration paths, avoids the otherwise-ap-\n plicable statutory bar based on a previous final rejection of\n a veteran\u2019s earlier claim. Second, the change in the present\n case materially differs from the particular changes that the\n court in Spencer and Routen held insufficient to allow a\n new original claim. We conclude not only that the two prec-\n edents provide no persuasive basis for rejecting the ordi-\n nary-meaning application of \u201cliberalizing\u201d to cover\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) but also that, even if the formulations used by\n\fCase: 20-1911    Document: 34      Page: 18    Filed: 07/28/2021\n\n\n\n\n 18                                       ORTIZ   v.

That change did not alter the veteran\u2019s affirmative\n case at all. It altered only the government\u2019s rebuttal case\u2014\n and did so only at the general level of specifying how per-\n suasive the government\u2019s evidence must be, not by altering\n particular components of proof. Those features critically\n differ from the elimination of a proof element of a veteran\u2019s\n affirmative case that was effected by the 2010 addition of\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3).\n                              C\n      To the extent relevant, VA\u2019s statements in adopting the\n 2010 the Final Rule underscore the conclusion that\n \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) is liberalizing. In the Final Rule, VA recog-\n nized that the 2010 amendment effectively \u201celiminate[d]\u201d\n an evidentiary \u201crequirement\u201d when the specified precondi-\n tions were met. See 75 Fed. Reg. at 39,843 (explaining that\n \u201c[t]his amendment eliminates the requirement for corrobo-\n rating that the claimed in-service stressor occurred if\u201d the\n preconditions are met (emphasis added)); Proposed Rule,\n 74 Fed.

App. at 152. To be sure, the Final Rule says\n that \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) would \u201cfacilitate the timely processing of\n PTSD claims by simplifying the development and research\n procedures that apply to these claims.\u201d 75 Fed.

Reg. at 42,618 (\u201cImproved timeliness, consistent\n decision-making, and equitable resolution of PTSD claims\n are the intended results of the revised regulation.\u201d). But\n those statements do not suggest a procedural character of\n the change actually made: A substantive change can be\n made to achieve process benefits. For example, a presump-\n tion of service connection would improve timeliness and\n consistency of decisionmaking, yet this court and VA have\n determined that a law or VA issue creating such a pre-\n sumption is liberalizing.\n     Finally, VA in the Final Rule asserted that the 2010\n addition of \u00a7 3.304(f)(3) \u201cgoverns procedural matters rather\n than creating a new basis for entitlement to service connec-\n tion for PTSD because it merely relaxes under certain cir-\n cumstances the evidentiary standard for establishing\n occurrence of a stressor.\u201d 75 Fed.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\f       {\u00b6 2} Appellants set forth two assignments of error:\n\n               I. The trial court abused its discretion when it terminated mother\u2019s\n\n       parental rights, when she had rebutted the presumption against termination\n\n       of rights pursuant to RC 2151.414(E)(11) by becoming and remaining\n\n       complaint [sic] with her case plan services, and when time remained on the\n\n       case.\n\n               II. The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that the minor\n\n       child here could not be returned to her father was not clear and convincing\n\n       with [sic] he was compliant with his mental health services; was employed\n\n       and had stable housing; when no concerns for his parenting were expressed\n\n       at trial; and when time remained on the case.\n\n                                        Background\n\n       {\u00b6 3} Appellant, T.F., is the biological mother (\u201cmother\u201d) of six children, fathered\n\nby different men. The youngest of mother\u2019s children is J.F., who was born in May 2019,\n\nand is the subject of the permanent custody award in this appeal. Appellant, Ja.F., is the\n\nbiological father (\u201cfather\u201d) of only J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} In June 2018, LCCS became involved with mother and three of her children\n\n(\u201cthe children\u201d), as they were homeless. Following an investigation, LCCS learned the\n\nchildren: did not have medical care due to mother\u2019s failure to follow up; were not\n\nregularly attending school; and had been physically abused on a daily basis by mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In July 2018, mother and father were married.\n\n\n\n2.\n\f       {\u00b6 6} On September 26, 2018, LCCS filed a complaint and request for emergency\n\nshelter care in Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, case No.\n\nJC18270763, and interim temporary custody of the children was awarded to LCCS. In\n\nDecember 2018, an adjudication hearing was held, after which two children were found\n\nto be dependent and neglected and the third child was found to be dependent, neglected\n\nand abused. Case plan services were offered including housing, mental health treatment,\n\nsubstance abuse treatment, domestic violence classes and parenting classes. Mother\n\nmostly had supervised, Level 1, visits with the children before her visits were suspended,\n\nin late October 2019, due to concerns with mother: slapping one child; behaving\n\ninappropriately with the children; and attempting to manipulate the children\u2019s\n\ndisclosures. After visits were suspended, the children\u2019s behaviors greatly improved, and\n\nthe children all indicated they did not wish to visit with mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} In July 2020, LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody of the children. In\n\nOctober 2020, a trial was held, and on November 6, 2020, the court issued its judgment\n\nentry awarding permanent custody of the children to LCCS. The court found, inter alia:\n\nmother attempted to comply with the case plan requirements, but failed to take advantage\n\nof the services available to her; mother struggled to accept any responsibility for her\n\nactions and the negative impact her actions had on the children; mother did not\n\nacknowledge the role she played in the children\u2019s removal; mother failed to recognize the\n\ntrauma she inflicted on the children; the children have thrived in substitute care; the\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fchildren\u2019s wishes were to remain out of mother\u2019s care; mother failed to remedy the\n\nproblems that caused the children to be placed outside of the home; mother suffers from a\n\nchronic mental or emotional illness so severe that she is unable to parent the children;\n\nmother demonstrated a lack of commitment to the children by her unwillingness to\n\nprovide an adequate permanent home; and the children were abandoned by their fathers.\n\nMother appealed; the judgment was affirmed. See In re S.W., R.W., J.W., 6th Dist. Lucas\n\nNo. L-20-1204, 2021-Ohio-2065.\n\n        {\u00b6 8} While in the midst of the case with the children, mother gave birth to J.F., in\n\nMay 2019. LCCS filed a complaint in dependency and motion for shelter care hearing in\n\nLucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, case No. JC19274734. A\n\nhearing was held, and interim temporary custody of J.F. was awarded to LCCS.\n\n        {\u00b6 9} On July 15, 2019, mother and father were ordered to pay child support of\n\n$80.00 per month for J.F. On January 16, 2020, mother filed a motion to terminate her\n\nchild support, as she claimed she is actively engaged in case plan service and is unable to\n\nwork.\n\n        {\u00b6 10} On May 20, 2020, mother filed a motion for legal custody of J.F. and to\n\ndetermine support and visitation, and father filed a motion to change disposition and for\n\nlegal custody of J.F. On August 12, 2020, a hearing was held and LCCS was granted an\n\nextension of its temporary custody of J.F.\n\n        {\u00b6 11} On September 23, 2020, LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody of\n\nJ.F. On December 2 and 7, 2020, the dispositional hearing was held, on December 10,\n\n\n\n4.\n\f2020, the court announced its decision, finding LCCS\u2019s motion for permanent custody\n\nwell-taken. On December 23, 2020, the court issued its judgment entry. Mother and\n\nfather appealed.\n\n                                 The Dispositional Hearing\n\n         {\u00b6 12} LCCS called several witnesses to testify, including caseworkers and the\n\nguardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d). Stipulated exhibits were admitted. Mother and father\n\ntestified and called two witnesses. The testimony relevant to the appeal is summarized\n\nbelow.\n\n                                          Therapist\n\n         {\u00b6 13} Berdonna Green testified she is a clinical therapist at Harbor Behavioral\n\nHealth (\u201cHarbor\u201d). She started seeing father in December 2019, and father also had\n\nservices at Harbor when he was a teenager. Father was diagnosed with \u201cBipolar I,\u201d and\n\nparticipates in medication therapy and psychotherapy. Green said father reported\n\nexperiencing some improvement with depression and in managing or coping with stress.\n\n         {\u00b6 14} Green was not sure how long father and mother have been married. Father\n\ntold Green that J.F. was not in his care due to the children. Green had heard that father\n\nfelt sabotaged by one child because that child only thinks of himself and what he can get\n\nout of the foster parents.\n\n         {\u00b6 15} Green has seen father for almost a year and he attended about 85 percent of\n\nhis sessions. In order to complete therapy with Harbor, father would have to report that\n\nhe has three to five coping skills to help him manage his bipolar, and report a reduction in\n\n\n\n5.\n\fhis symptoms. Green said father has reported that he has three coping skills. Green\n\nstated father is on the path to managing his bipolar disorder. Green has weekly team\n\nmeetings with the doctors but there is no firm idea of a timeline for father\u2019s therapy.\n\n                                       Charles Allen\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Allen testified he is the community organizer for Empower 1, which takes\n\nhomeless families and houses them. The program works in three-year increments to help\n\nfamilies restructure their lives, through life planning and financial planning. Typically,\n\nthe program helps families who are together, but mother and father were in a\n\nreunification plan with children services, so it was thought the children would be home\n\nwithin a few months; it is now close to two years. Mother and father \u201cpretty much\u201d\n\nengaged in the life services until Covid, and were given space to finish the classes in their\n\nreunification plan. Empower 1 offers parenting courses, but mother and father had\n\nparenting classes with the reunification plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Empower 1 works with families so they can move into permanent\n\nsupportive housing or fair market housing, but mother and father\u2019s income was not\n\nconsistent, as it was difficult for them to maintain steady work. Mother tried to work on\n\nher obtaining her GED, but no classes were offered due to the pandemic, so she looked\n\nfor work.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Allen said it was \u201cvery difficult to * * * walk [father] through steps to\n\nunderstand a lot of different things, even how to get his pay stub or what a pay stub was.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been working with him on those things.\u201d Father\u2019s jobs were through a\n\n\n\n6.\n\ftemporary agency, so Allen did not know if father could not keep a job because of his\n\ndisability or if the jobs were just short-term. Allen thought it would probably take\n\nanother year for mother and father to be ready for fair market value housing, and he\n\nbelieved the route for them would be more subsidized housing.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Mother and father had two initial courses to take with Empower 1, one\n\ncourse was \u201csort of a life management course which is a lot of time management and how\n\nto schedule and put things down and remember when their appointment was,\u201d and they\n\nalso had to attend biweekly meetings. In the beginning \u201cit got a little rough\u201d for them.\n\nAllen believed with the proper wrap-support services and further education, mother and\n\nfather could maintain a child.\n\n                                 Caseworker Emily Costell\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Costell testified she was an ongoing caseworker when she became involved\n\nwith mother and the children in June 2018, as the family was homeless. Mother and\n\nfather were together for a number of years before they married in July 2018. When\n\nmother and the children were staying at a shelter where father was unable to stay, the\n\nagency received calls that mother was \u201cwhooping\u201d her children and they were screaming\n\nand crying.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Case plan services were offered to mother and father, which included dual\n\ndiagnostic assessments, parenting and getting stable housing. Although mother did what\n\nshe had to do to engage in family therapy, the children were not ready to participate in\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\ffamily trauma therapy. When mother and father found housing, they assumed the\n\nchildren would be returned to them even though the other case plan services had not been\n\nimplemented. This conversation occurred almost monthly, as mother and father did not\n\nunderstand why the children were not returned to them.\n\n      {\u00b6 22} In June 2020, mother acknowledged that she may have been too harsh with\n\nthe children, but by August 2020, when Costell stopped working with the family, mother\n\nsaid she never did anything to the children. Costell said father also acknowledged at one\n\npoint that mother might have gone too far, but he does not always acknowledge it and\n\nusually minimizes mother\u2019s behavior and the risk she presents to the children.\n\n      {\u00b6 23} Mother and father have said the children were removed because they were\n\nblack and Costell was white, money-hungry and corrupt. Mother said she had never done\n\nanything to make the children fearful and she has never harmed them.\n\n      {\u00b6 24} Costell testified at the permanent custody hearing for the children. The\n\nissues which caused mother to lose custody were that she physically abused the children\n\nand she had mental health issues. Costell believed mother did not accept responsibility\n\nfor the trauma the children had gone through.\n\n      {\u00b6 25} Regarding J.F., she was deemed to be dependent, and LCCS received\n\ntemporary custody of her on July 9, 2019. Mother had Level 1 visits at the agency two\n\ndays a week with J.F. Costell observed three of mother\u2019s visits with J.F. and never saw\n\nanything inappropriate. However, Costell received a report from a security officer that in\n\nFebruary 2020, mother was focused on doing J.F.\u2019s hair, but J.F. was crying and\n\n\n\n8.\n\fscreaming. If the security officer looked at mother, she would stop, but if the officer\n\nlooked away, mother would continue to try to do J.F.\u2019s hair.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} When visits became virtual, on Google Duo, because of Covid, the foster\n\nmother reported mother missed visits or was late about six times. Father was not\n\nconsistent in visiting J.F., as he has missed visits and was late. Mother and father\u2019s visits\n\nwith J.F. were never suspended.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Regarding housing, Costell said mother and father have housing, through\n\nEmpower 1, and live in a duplex. The duplex is appropriate and there are no concerns.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} As to father, he was referred in September 2019, to a 12-week parenting\n\nprogram, and he successfully completed the classroom portion in July 2020. He did not\n\ncomplete the observations portion, due to scheduling conflicts and Covid. Costell had\n\nconcerns with father\u2019s parenting ability as it appears he does not understand things that\n\nshe explains to him, so she did not know if he had a mental health issue or a cognitive\n\ndelay. Father also disclosed that mother has some anger issues and has been aggressive\n\nwith the children, but then he denies that he has seen any abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Father was referred in July 2018, to Unison for a dual assessment, which he\n\ncompleted in mid-July 2018. He had to be re-referred in January 2019, because he was\n\nnot following through. Then, in September 2019, he wanted to switch providers and go\n\nto Harbor. He was referred to Harbor in October 2019, and had three assessments\n\nscheduled; he cancelled two and was a no-show for the third. He rescheduled another\n\nassessment, which he attended, and he has been compliant with meeting his therapist.\n\n\n\n9.\n\f       {\u00b6 30} Costell does not think father has progressed far enough in his services to\n\nreunify with J.F. as he still has to work on his mental health, and he is still with mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Costell would have concerns if J.F. were returned to mother soon because\n\nJ.F. has special needs and she is unable to protect herself or report abuse or neglect or\n\nremove herself from those situations. J.F. was referred to Help Me Grow in June 2019,\n\nand is still involved with the program. J.F. has sensory and fine motor skill delays, eating\n\nissues and was referred to an eye specialist. Costell did not believe J.F. would be safe\n\nwith mother, and father would not be able to protect J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} Costell stated J.F. has been in the same foster home, but it is not a potential\n\nadoptive placement. Costell testified LCCS is asking for permanent custody of J.F.\n\n                             Caseworker Rhonda Nicholson\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Nicholson testified she is an ongoing caseworker for LCCS and has been\n\non J.F.\u2019s case since August 2020; case plan services for mother and father were already in\n\neffect. At the time of the hearing, mother still had housing, was engaged in mental health\n\nservices and was attending new parenting classes. Mother started out rocky with the new\n\nparenting classes, as she missed orientation and three appointments. The parent educator\n\ndid not want mother to continue, but Nicholson convinced her to give mother another\n\nchance. Mother has been compliant with the weekly classes since October 16, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Since Nicholson was assigned to the case, mother has had Level 1 visits\n\nwith J.F. Mother never missed a visit, was late or inappropriate. But, Nicholson had\n\nconcerns about mother\u2019s visits with J.F. and her ability to parent J.F. Before mother lost\n\n\n\n10.\n\fcustody of the children, it was reported the children were afraid of mother and did not\n\nwant to return home because of the abuse, but mother denied that she had abused them.\n\nAfter mother lost custody, she did not reach out to arrange a final visit with the children.\n\nNicholson contacted mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Father was still engaged with mental health services, he completed\n\nparenting classes in March 2020, and he has housing. Nicholson had concerns with\n\nfather\u2019s ability to parent and protect J.F. because he blames the children for J.F. not being\n\nhome, he feels one child sabotaged the case, he does not believe mother abused or\n\nneglected the children or acted aggressively with them, and he does not appear to have\n\nany concerns with mother\u2019s parenting style.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} With respect to J.F. being placed with a relative, Nicholson testified that on\n\nher way into court for the hearing, father asked her if she had contacted his aunt and\n\nfather said mother\u2019s adult son may be a potential placement. Nicholson did not know\n\nwhat father was talking about regarding his aunt, and although mother mentioned her\n\nadult son to Nicholson during the first home visit, mother said the previous caseworker\n\ndid not approve of her son because he was verbally aggressive with that caseworker.\n\nNicholson spoke with Emily Costell and learned the son and his girlfriend were both very\n\naggressive at the initial staffing, and the girlfriend refused to undergo a criminal\n\nbackground check. Costell\u2019s supervisor said if the couple was not willing to be cleared\n\nthrough the system, the couple could not be considered for placement.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f       {\u00b6 37} Regarding J.F., she is a one year old with developmental delays, she is\n\nnonverbal and very small for her age. J.F. falls a lot, has balance issues, is startled by\n\nloud noises and has feeding and texture issues. J.F. completed physical therapy before\n\nNicholson was involved, and now has weekly occupational therapy sessions, early\n\nintervention services once a month and she sees a GI doctor. The doctor wants J.F. to try\n\nmilk even though she does not like it.\n\n       {\u00b6 38} The foster mother gives J.F. formula because she is concerned J.F. is not\n\ngetting enough nutrition. Nicholson said the foster mother is very attentive to J.F.\u2019s\n\nneeds. Nicholson talked to mother and father about J.F. not liking certain foods and they\n\nsaid she will probably be a vegetarian as she does not like meat.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Nicholson testified that LCCS is asking for permanent custody of J.F.\n\n                                 Maternal Grandmother\n\n       {\u00b6 40} J.F.\u2019s grandmother testified she met J.F. at the hospital when she was born,\n\nand she stayed about three hours. Grandmother has had no interaction with J.F. since that\n\nday. Grandmother was not sure when J.F. was born.\n\n       {\u00b6 41} Grandmother said mother had six children, including J.F. Regarding the\n\nchildren who were removed from mother\u2019s care, grandmother said mother was a very\n\ngood mother to them, very attentive, she made sure they had something to eat and\n\n\u201csomewhere comfortable to lay their head.\u201d Grandmother had not seen the children in\n\ntwo-and-a-half to three years.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 42} Grandmother thought mother had become a better parent and person\n\n\u201cbecause she wasn\u2019t working * * * when she probably had the kids. Now she is working\n\nand * * * [has] somewhere for them to stay and * * * more money to make sure that they\n\ngot something to eat.\u201d Grandmother retired January 31, 2020, and said she is now able\n\nto help mother. Grandmother thought father was \u201cpretty nice, a pretty nice dude. He was\n\npretty kindhearted * * * a mellow dude.\u201d He was very good to mother, \u201c[b]etter man\n\nthan any of her kids\u2019 father been I think.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Grandmother did not know what mother\u2019s address was, but knows where\n\nmother lives. Grandmother did not know what mother did if the children misbehaved\n\nbecause grandmother \u201cwasn\u2019t really around her like that,\u201d but mother probably believed\n\nin whoopings, as mother was whooped as a child.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Grandmother was asked how often she sees mother and she said \u201cnot real\n\noften, but I talk to her all the time. * * * I don\u2019t drive and she don\u2019t drive so * * * it\u2019s not\n\nthat easy for me to just * * * go get her or go see her.\u201d Before LCCS was involved, \u201cI\n\nthink [mother] lived with me before [J.F.] was born and the kids were little. [Mother]\n\nlived with me for a minute. She stayed with me.\u201d Grandmother said mother and the\n\nchildren lived with her for maybe two or three years, then mother \u201cwanted to get out and\n\nget her own. You know, my apartment wasn\u2019t that big. So I let her stay with me * * *\n\nfor the kids and she could get out and get her own place.\u201d Grandmother knew mother\n\nand the children were homeless, but she did not have them live with her as \u201cI didn\u2019t have\n\nenough room for her and the kids to stay with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n13.\n\f                                    Maternal Great Aunt\n\n         {\u00b6 45} Great aunt to J.F. testified she is mother\u2019s aunt and grandmother\u2019s sister.\n\nGreat aunt met J.F. in the hospital after she was born, and has only seen pictures of her\n\nsince.\n\n         {\u00b6 46} Great aunt saw mother with the children about twice a month and mother\u2019s\n\n\u201ckids were everything to her. * * * And I\u2019m the one that took her to the grocery store and\n\nshe would buy all these groceries, and she said, girl, I got to feed my kids.\u201d Great aunt is\n\nthere for mother, if mother needs a ride or money.\n\n         {\u00b6 47} Great aunt said mother has had a hard life, and did the best she could with\n\nwhat she knew and \u201cwith the kids she did a good job.\u201d Great aunt thought mother was \u201ca\n\nvery good parent.\u201d Grandmother lost custody of mother \u201cwhen [mother] was coming up\n\n* * * [then] she eventually got them back.\u201d Mother and grandmother \u201cthey kind of\n\nclashed heads a little bit for a long time.\u201d Mother\u2019s parents did not have a \u201cvery good\n\nhealthy relationship so [mother] didn\u2019t really know too much about healthy relationships\n\nand how to bring up a person -- or a child.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 48} Great aunt did not know mother\u2019s address, but she has been to the house\n\nseveral times. The last time was when \u201cmy brother got back, and she started using my\n\nbrother because he has a bigger truck for hauling her groceries back and forth.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 49} Great aunt has not seen mother parent the children since \u201cthey took them\n\naway from her.\u201d Great aunt said mother did not have the equipment to bring up a child\n\nbecause mother lost her home, she did not have a job, she lost whatever support she had.\n\n\n\n14.\n\fGreat aunt thought the children were taken from mother because she was homeless.\n\nGreat aunt \u201cwas taking them from hotel to hotel to find them somewhere to stay. I was\n\ntaking them to shelters. And when they would kick her out of a shelter, I would go pick\n\nher up and we would find somewhere else.\u201d Great aunt also thought mother did not have\n\nthe children in school because they did not have their shots and they did not have clothes.\n\n       {\u00b6 50} Great aunt said mother now has the equipment to bring up a child as she\n\nhas a home, it is furnished, she has a husband who has a job and tries to take care of her.\n\nMother has more support now than she did then.\n\n       {\u00b6 51} Great aunt was asked if she knew the children were found to be abused and\n\ngreat aunt said \u201cI don\u2019t think it was by [mother].\u201d Great aunt looked shocked and said\n\nshe never saw mother punish the children. Great aunt said if she found out a child was\n\nabused, that would change her opinion about mother\u2019s ability to parent.\n\n       {\u00b6 52} Great aunt thought father \u201cseems to be a very nice young man, hard\n\nworking. Whenever he gets a job, he did the best he could. He didn\u2019t have any\n\ntransportation so I know at one point he was taking a bike going back and forth to work.\u201d\n\n                                          Mother\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Mother testified J.F. is 17 months old, and LCCS immediately took J.F.\n\nafter she was born. Mother was seeing J.F. twice a week for at least a year at the agency\n\nin a room with a security guard. After Covid, mother saw J.F. once a week virtually, in a\n\nvideo chat over the phone. J.F. met the children at visits at the agency before mother\u2019s\n\nvisits with the children were suspended in October 2019.\n\n\n\n15.\n\f         {\u00b6 54} Mother believed her rights to the children were terminated because she was\n\nnot acknowledging that she had done something wrong. Mother said, \u201cI can\n\nacknowledge and do agree on things that I\u2019ve done wrong and made mistakes toward my\n\nother three kids in which I\u2019ve learned through the parenting class that I\u2019m going through\n\nright now not to do and make the same mistakes again.\u201d Mother said she was \u201c[n]ot\n\ngiving them enough attention, not taking them to they doctor appointments. Not\n\nscheduling appointments, and not making sure I had transportation to get them back and\n\nforth to their appointments, and not being able to keep a roof over their head.\u201d Mother\n\nsaid she has learned \u201c[t]o maintain food, to maintain housing and to maintain the needs,\n\ngoing back and forth to the doctors and making sure her appointments are met and\n\nmaking sure that if I cancel an appointment, that I make sure that I stick to the\n\nappointment. And as well that she makes sure that she gets everything that she desires\n\nand needs and wants.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 55} Mother said she made mistakes when she punished the children, as she did\n\nnot know \u201chow to overcome the overwhelming stress that I was going through and\n\ndealing with.\u201d She learned to deal with stress by going outside, jogging, seeing family,\n\nreading, taking a bath, meditating and listening to music. Before, mother asked\n\ngrandmother to \u201ckeep the kids for a couple of days, * * * just to give me a break from my\n\nkids.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 56} Mother was asked if she heard the testimony about her doing J.F.\u2019s hair and\n\nhow it was traumatic for J.F. Mother said she heard the testimony and \u201cI don\u2019t agree on\n\n\n\n16.\n\fthat, to agree or disagree. I totally outright as much as possible disagree with that\n\nbecause I would never just let my daughter just keep continuing crying and not asking her\n\nif she\u2019s okay or give her a hug or kiss. Her [sic] just to say it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just making you\n\nbeautiful or making you pretty so your hair will be done for the day.\u201d Mother thought\n\nJ.F. \u201cwould be fussing and crying, and she * * * just possibly had got up too early that\n\nmorning. And she be too tired to even want to go through me doing her hair.\u201d Mother\n\nconcluded the foster mother had gotten J.F. up too early.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} Mother did not miss visits but was late to visits \u201c[b]ecause of the time of\n\nme coming from the grocery store or coming from another appointment.\u201d Mother does\n\nnot drive, so she walks, bikes or catches the bus. Mother has worked as a home health\n\naide for almost three months, and is getting her GED. Father also works, and the income\n\nthey make allows them to support themselves. Mother said, \u201cwe making so much money\n\nthey took us off of food stamps because we\u2019re no longer getting food stamps. So we\u2019re\n\nstill able to maintain food without having food stamps.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Mother and father have lived at their home for almost two years, and pay\n\n$400 per month in rent. Mother and father also do volunteer work, a class or a meeting\n\nwith Empower 1 as a requirement for living in the house.\n\n       {\u00b6 59} Mother goes to Harbor for her mental health treatment and she has gone\n\nthere on and off since 2011. She was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder,\n\nbipolar and anxiety. To manage her diagnoses, mother takes medication, plays video\n\ngames, cooks and cleans. Mother was asked if she takes her medicine as prescribed and\n\n\n\n17.\n\fshe said \u201c[y]es, I do.\u201d She was asked if she took her medicine every day and she said\n\n\u201c[y]es, I do.\u201d She was then asked if she missed any doses and she replied \u201cI go maybe\n\nonce -- well, every other day because of the fact of -- because of my job. I don\u2019t want to\n\noversleep and be late for my job because it leads me to being late for my job.\u201d Mother\n\nworks four days a week, 8:00 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mother was asked if she has talked to her\n\ndoctor about the medicine and she replied, \u201c[n]ot lately * * * I plan on letting her know if\n\nI can only take it on a day that I don\u2019t have to work and the days that I don\u2019t have to work\n\nto being able to still have the same -- the same effect.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 60} Mother was asked about the parenting program, in which she had been for\n\nthe last two weeks, and she said she has learned \u201cphysical and verbal * * * redirection * *\n\n* [a]nd * * * how to love your child and not be physically harmful toward your child.\u201d\n\nShe thinks these have helped her be a different parent and keep her child safe and\n\nprotected.\n\n       {\u00b6 61} Mother was asked if she heard testimony that she did not always make the\n\nvirtual visits and she said she heard it, but it was not correct. Mother was asked if she\n\nmissed some virtual visits and she responded \u201cI might have missed a couple of them. * *\n\n* [T]he lady, [foster mother] was supposed to be getting in contact with me between 1\n\nand 1:30. She would call me at around 12, 1:30. She called me at 12:30 at another time\n\nor 1 o\u2019clock and then call me at 12:30 another time. So it varied on what time she would\n\ncall. So I never knew what time she was going to call on a general basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\f        {\u00b6 62} Mother wanted the court to know that \u201cI know how to maintain and\n\nestablish clothing for my daughter, maintain food for my daughter, maintain housing and\n\nmake sure that she\u2019s safe and protected. And as well making sure that she has everything\n\nthat she wants and desires and needs.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 63} On cross-examination, mother said since the hearing a month earlier, she is\n\nno longer smoking marijuana. Mother said she is current with her mental health provider\n\nand she remembers telling her counselor that CSB was keeping the children for the\n\nmoney and her son was being coached. Mother said, \u201c[t]he close-knit relationship with\n\nme and my son before CSB had taken them, me and my son had a relationship that any\n\nmother -- or any mother and son would be jealous of our relationship because of the fact\n\nthat we were so close that my kids could come and talk to me. They could come and\n\nlaugh with me. They could come and play with me. We could do anything together that\n\nno other mother and son would possibly think to even do.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 64} Mother said it was traumatic having the children taken away as \u201cmy kids\n\nare so important to me. And doing their hair, getting their clothes clean, taking them to\n\nthe shopping mall, taking them shopping and going out to eat, and doing fun stuff with\n\nthem and traveling with them is something that I had grew up doing -- was traveling with\n\nmy family every year. That\u2019s something I wanted to do with my kids that I can\u2019t do\n\nnow.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 65} Mother was asked about J.F.\u2019s therapies and she said J.F. went to physical\n\ntherapy and goes to occupational therapy \u201cto get her coordinated to be able to stretch her\n\n\n\n19.\n\fmuscles and being able to relax her hands because she was balling up her hands.\u201d When\n\nasked if those therapies were important for J.F.\u2019s well-being, mother said, \u201cI believe they\n\nknow about [J.F.], but I don\u2019t believe that they know all the time of how [J.F.] could\n\npossibly not drink milk at all. That\u2019s the part I\u2019m not understanding why she\u2019s not\n\ndrinking milk. But she is in some form of drinking milk, but it\u2019s not the type of milk that\n\nI\u2019m drinking or her dad is drinking that it would help her bones become stronger so as\n\nshe grows. Her bones will become stronger instead of brittle.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 66} Mother was asked about J.F.\u2019s eyes and mother said, \u201cher left eye she has --\n\nI believe it\u2019s a stigmatism. I don\u2019t know. She told me before it could be, and the doctor\n\ntold her it would be possibly a tumor. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a tumor. I believe it\u2019s a\n\nstigmatism that she possibly have in her eye, and she genetically got from me from my\n\nyoung age that I received a stigmatism in my eye. And she\u2019s not able to get the one eye\n\nto be able to look straight like I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d Mother said she asked the foster\n\nmother about J.F.\u2019s eye treatment, \u201cand it, like, goes in one ear and other the other.\u201d\n\nMother was asked if she recalled saying she did not notice anything wrong with J.F.\u2019s\n\neyes, and she said, \u201cI have pictures where she is not seen with a lazy eye. Her eye is not\n\ncrossing. Her eyes looked at me like I\u2019m looking at you. And plus my husband has --\n\nhe\u2019s a first (sic) so I know -- pretty much know my daughter will be looked after.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 67} Mother said J.F. sees a GI doctor for her stomach \u201c[b]ecause from my\n\nunderstanding * * * she couldn\u2019t stand the taste of textures, or she couldn\u2019t eat meat or\n\nshe just didn\u2019t want to eat meat.\u201d Mother recalled that J.F. had problems tolerating\n\n\n\n20.\n\fformulas. Mother said when J.F. goes home \u201c[i]f [J.F.] she can tolerate milk, there\u2019s a\n\ncertain kind of milk I can give her. I wouldn\u2019t force her to drink milk if she can\u2019t drink\n\nmilk. But if she can drink milk, yes, I will give my daughter milk so, therefore, she will\n\nhave some milk that will strengthen her bones.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 68} Mother said at one time \u201cI did think that she wouldn\u2019t need them other\n\ntherapies, but being that I see that she has special needs, yes, she do need * * * them.\u201d\n\nMother changed her mind \u201cwhen I seen my daughter * * * have a patch over her eye and\n\nunderstanding that. * * * It\u2019s making it strong.\u201d\n\n                                           Father\n\n       {\u00b6 69} Father testified he is married to mother and \u201cI\u2019ve been living with her for a\n\nwhile now, like, what is it, two years.\u201d J.F. is their child and mother \u201chad two older boys,\n\nand they grown now so -- they\u2019re -- you know, they pretty much -- they don\u2019t say too\n\nmuch bad about their mother as much as they don\u2019t really, like, you know try to -- they\n\ndon\u2019t try to -- they don\u2019t really try to say anything bad about their mother last time I\n\nchecked.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 70} Father was asked, \u201c[t]here are three other children?\u201d Father replied, \u201c[y]ou\n\nsaid three other children? No. No. No. There weren\u2019t.\u201d He was then asked \u201cso when\n\n[LCCS] initially got involved with [mother\u2019s] other children, that was before you[?]\u201d He\n\nsaid \u201c[t]hat was the time when we were separated. When we got in -- they said we got in\n\na little proclaimed altercation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n21.\n\f       {\u00b6 71} Regarding his understanding of LCCS\u2019s reasons for removing the children,\n\nfather said, \u201c[w]ell, when it came down to that, I knew very well. And I witnessed a lot\n\nof things that were going on at the time when we were living in shelters. And what they\n\nwere pretty much saying was that somebody pretty much -- somebody that was next door\n\nto us that was, like, a resident at the shelter at that time pretty much said that -- and I\n\nwasn\u2019t there but when I was there, I didn\u2019t see none of the stuff go on.\u201d Father was asked\n\nthe question again, he said, \u201c[w]ell, their concern I feel like they should have did, like,\n\nmore research before they just took them the way I see it.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 72} Father stated LCCS\u2019s allegations were abuse and neglect, but \u201chow can\n\nsomebody neglect somebody if they keeping their eyes on them 24/7? * * * And then\n\nwhen it come down to abuse, when you all say abuse, I understand the mother, you know,\n\nif she choked the child or tried to kill the child or anything like that. But none of that\n\nstuff never happened.\u201d Regarding concerns with physical abuse, father stated, \u201c[t]o be\n\nhonest, she probably disciplined them, but it wasn\u2019t major. It was more like a warning,\n\nlike, don\u2019t do this again like any mother would do. I mean my momma did it.\u201d Father\n\nwas asked what the physical abuse incidents were and he said, \u201c[t]he incidents that pretty\n\nmuch happened -- I am going to be honest. Me and her used to get in arguments, and the\n\nkids used to see that. Yes, we had a rough relationship at one time. Yes, we had a lot of\n\nthings going on. Yes, she probably got too bothered about certain things. She was\n\nprobably stressing and over the edge, but at the same time I always used to work things\n\nout with her and her kids. There were times when I come out my pocket and she\u2019ll come\n\n\n\n22.\n\fout her pocket, and we\u2019ll feed them. There were times when we would just go to\n\nGoodwill because I was budgeting on the checks that I was getting.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 73} Father thought mother was a really good mother, so he cannot say that her\n\none child was abused. Father said he heard the caseworkers\u2019 testimony that he did not\n\nunderstand or believe the allegations or concerns, but he \u201cunderstood everything. But at\n\nthe same time I\u2019ve got to go by the beliefs of the child, and that\u2019s understandable. I can\n\ndo that. But if it\u2019s nothing truthful in that, you all -- you know, you all remember the\n\nsituation to my rights of the constitution. What else can I say?\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 74} Father said he was concerned because he talked to the one child who said\n\nhe lost his virginity and had sex with a 24-year old. \u201cSo it was like at that time I had to\n\nreally, you know, remind myself that this lady ain\u2019t really paying attention like she\u2019s\n\nsupposed to. * * * LCCS, they got to be responsible and accountable for even allowing\n\nthat to happen.\u201d Father raised the concern because he wants the court to know \u201cI think\n\nit\u2019s a lot of re-appealing we are doing with case. Because those ain\u2019t my biological kids,\n\nbut for my concern for her, I just wish, you know, they can change this whole matter and\n\ndo this case over again. You know, to really do their studies on it and really get to know\n\nthe kids more. Because kids going to tell anybody anything. I was once a kid as well.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 75} Father was offered case plan services when LCCS first became involved\n\nwith mother and the children because he was married to her and they lived together. He\n\nsaid, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna to lie, I probably didn\u2019t come to every last one of them * * * Emily\n\nCostell was giving me my stuff last minute. * * * [S]he really didn\u2019t want to put me on\n\n\n\n23.\n\fthe case for real when her kids got tooken (sic) away.\u201d Case plan services continued after\n\nJ.F. was born, with reunification as the goal.\n\n       {\u00b6 76} Father did not always agree with how mother disciplined the children, \u201cshe\n\ngot this thing, you know, with her that kind of creeped me out. When she got, you know,\n\nmad at me when I asked her, you know, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do this, it wasn\u2019t like abuse\n\nor nothing like that. It was just the way she used to get mad at the kids * * * she\u2019ll get --\n\nnot violent with them. She would cuss them out, so I would say, no, don\u2019t do that * * *\n\ndon\u2019t yell at your child.\u201d Father felt like mother would cherish and nourish J.F. because\n\nmother \u201ccame a long way. Just to be honest with you all, * * * she been doing -- you\n\nknow, she was doing fine. Plus she understands well what she did wrong on some things.\n\nBut somebody who put abuse and neglect still doesn\u2019t make it right, putting something on\n\nsomeone knowing it\u2019s not true.\u201d Father said he will protect J.F., as she is his first child.\n\n       {\u00b6 77} Father said visits were going well until one child \u201cmade the allegation that\n\nher mother allegedly smacked her. * * * [H]ow can you smack somebody when there\u2019s\n\nfull of cameras? * * * [H]ow can the mother smack the child * * * It just -- it\u2019s\n\npropaganda.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 78} Father was diagnosed with bipolar during J.F.\u2019s case, and he takes\n\nmedication which keeps him content. Father agreed with his therapist\u2019s report, but he\n\nwas surprised that she had not had a conversation with the doctor and treatment team.\n\nFather thought if the therapist had the conversation and he had successfully completed his\n\nmental health care, that would have impacted how LCCS viewed his progress. Father\n\n\n\n24.\n\fbelieved it would have taken his therapist to say that he had coping skills in order for\n\nLCCS to say he had successfully completed mental health services, but she did not testify\n\nabout that. Father said he would continue his therapy, as he is starting to like it because\n\nhe has someone he can talk to about his problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 79} Father said Rhonda Nicholson told him LCCS\u2019s concerns were \u201cmy wife.\n\nAin\u2019t no -- ain\u2019t nothing regarding me. It\u2019s something that LCCS not appreciating what\n\nmy wife did. All she did was speak her mind about some things, and you see what\n\nhappened.\u201d Father said he did everything that he was supposed to do, \u201c[m]y daughter got\n\nwipes, * * * Pampers, * * * a bed. * * * What is the problem?\u201d Father stated he learned\n\nabout safety measures, how to protect his daughter, and patience.\n\n       {\u00b6 80} Father said there was \u201c[n]o proof\u201d of domestic violence between him and\n\nmother. Regarding housing, father said \u201c[s]ome people say it\u2019s housing assisting, but how\n\nis it house assisting when I pay rent and lights and gas? It\u2019s not for free.\u201d Father believes\n\nhe can maintain housing. He was asked about getting independent housing, and father\n\nsaid, \u201cjust me staying at the place right now, that\u2019s independently done. * * * [Y]es it\u2019s a\n\nprogram, but it teach you how to manage your own well being.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 81} Father is currently employed and is still trying to get his GED. When he\n\ngets paid, the temporary employment agency takes half \u201cplus the state child support is\n\ntaking my money too. Every time I get a job, they take about $80 or maybe like $115.\u201d\n\nFather believes he is in a position to take custody of J.F. As to other services which may\n\nbe needed, father said, \u201cone thing based on what I\u2019m hearing, that she do need special\n\n\n\n25.\n\fneeds for her eye doctor, you know, dental sooner or later. Because she\u2019s getting bigger.\n\nBased on her eating, there\u2019s a good chance she might be vegan.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 82} On cross-examination, father said he had proof that the children were not\n\nabused, but \u201cnot physical evidence.\u201d Father feels railroaded by LCCS because some of\n\nthe allegations made by the children against mother were not true and the children were\n\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d taking advantage of their situation with the foster parents. Father does not\n\nbelieve mother smacked the child during a visit. Father does not like Lucas County\n\nChild Support taking money out of his paycheck \u201c[b]ecause that\u2019s not my baby mama.\n\nThat\u2019s her right there.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 83} Father said his sisters could watch J.F. while he is working. He was asked\n\nwhere his sisters lived and he said, \u201c[o]ne of my sisters -- I ain\u2019t going to lie. To be\n\nhonest, she live in the Greenbelt. And then I have another sister, and she live in the\n\nGreenbelt as well.\u201d Father said a lot of people talk bad about the Greenbelt apartments.\n\n       {\u00b6 84} On further cross-examination, father said when he married mother they\n\nwere homeless. Father admitted he was kicked out of a shelter \u201c[b]ecause of arguing that\n\ntook place.\u201d When the children were removed from mother\u2019s care, father was on the case\n\nplan, but the caseworker would not let father visit the children. Father heard one child\n\nwas deemed to be an abused child, but \u201cwhen you all said that my wife had burnt him --\n\nwell, somebody said it. Somebody said that they had checked a burnt mark on his back\n\nsaying that, I guess, she burned him, and that wasn\u2019t even true. * * * He burnt himself.\u201d\n\nFather said the finding of abuse was wrong and \u201c[i]f you\u2019re feeding your kid and clothing\n\n\n\n26.\n\fyou kid and they have a roof over then head, that\u2019s not mistreated. But sometimes\n\nparents have to discipline they kids. By law you can hit the child in the buttocks, but not\n\nwith a belt but you hand.\u201d Father acknowledged the children were not seeing doctors\n\nbecause of transportation problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 85} Regarding reports made by the children, father said \u201cyes, you supposed to\n\nbelieve the child, yes. Yes, that\u2019s absolutely true. You supposed to believe the child if\n\nthey got -- if it comes down to abuse, molestation, whatever the case is. But if it\u2019s not\n\naccurate enough and if you know it\u2019s not accurate enough and you know, it just a whole\n\nlittle game of propaganda that you all playing with, yeah, it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d As\n\nto the child who said she was slapped by mother during a visit, \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t play any little\n\ngames with your momma based on telling any story.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 86} Father said LCCS filed the permanent custody motion because mother\n\nspoke her mind and father \u201cnot agreeing with half of the things that you all saying.\u201d\n\nRegarding his concerns about the one child having sex, father was asked if he called the\n\nagency to report it and he responded \u201c[n]o, not at that time. Well, as a matter of fact I\n\ndid, but nobody ever answered. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, right. Nobody ever\n\ndid answer. If you\u2019re talking about -- or are you talking about me talking about -- [?]\u201d\n\nAlso, father did not raise the issue at the 90-day review meeting in June 2020, or with the\n\ncaseworker because he did not think he would be believed.\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\f                          Foster Mother and Parents\u2019 Rebuttal\n\n       {\u00b6 87} Foster mother testified she has fostered children for 50 years, and has been\n\ncaring for J.F. since she was released from the hospital at two days old. J.F.\u2019s difficulties\n\nupon leaving the hospital included tremors for the first few months and feeding issues of\n\ngagging and vomiting, she could not tolerate milk, she was weak on one side and she\n\ncould only roll to one side; J.F. was listed as failure to thrive. The agency recommended\n\nHelp Me Grow for J.F., and she was referred to a gastrointestinal doctor, physical therapy\n\nand occupational therapy for her feeding and sensory issues and deficits. Foster mother\n\ntakes J.F. to appointments and to twice-a-week visitations with mother and father.\n\n       {\u00b6 88} J.F. had an MRI after foster mother noticed problems with J.F.\u2019s eyes and\n\nthe pediatrician sent J.F. to an eye doctor. J.F. saw the eye doctor in October 2020, and\n\nthe doctor thought there may be issues with the optical nerve not getting the right blood\n\nsupply. J.F. was prescribed glasses and an eye patch.\n\n       {\u00b6 89} Foster mother talked to mother and father about J.F.\u2019s services, but\n\n\u201cwhenever I would bring up anything, the only response I got was if she were with me,\n\nshe wouldn\u2019t have these issues or I don\u2019t see these issues.\u201d When mother and father were\n\nallowed to go to J.F.\u2019s appointments, foster mother would tell them about the\n\nappointments, yet mother said she was never told, so the caseworker had foster mother\n\nwrite a list of the appointments for mother. Mother and father went to one appointment,\n\nfor the GI doctor, although there were at least six appointments on the list. Thereafter,\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\fmother and father did not ask about J.F.\u2019s services, her MRI results or why she had a\n\npatch on her glasses.\n\n       {\u00b6 90} Foster mother said father told her that CSB was against him, and the\n\nchildren made up all of the stories about mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 91} Mother testified, in rebuttal, that foster mother told her about four of J.F.\u2019s\n\nappointments, but mother \u201chad meetings on the days that she [foster mother] set doctor\n\nappointments. One I was able to get to, the other one right before the pandemic had\n\npretty much sent me to not being able to go because I had other appointments to go to.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 92} Mother had concerns that J.F. was not drinking milk, and nobody has\n\nhelped to alleviate those concerns. Mother also had issues with the way the foster mother\n\ntook care of J.F. because sometimes J.F. would have on dirty clothes that had not been\n\nwashed, and when mother would change J.F.\u2019s diaper she would \u201cstill have stuff in\n\nbetween her legs.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 93} Father testified, in rebuttal, that his main concern was that J.F. would come\n\nto visits with \u201cnot good hygiene,\u201d and \u201c[t]here were times where it felt like the clothes\n\nthat she was wearing was already wore before or after. There were times when she\n\nwould come with * * * snotty nose, * * * face, all crusty. * * * I believe a kid, you know,\n\nshould be nourished by their hygiene even down to their skin. Plus my daughter got\n\nmelanin, so it\u2019s important.\u201d Father stated \u201c[i]t was just my main concern her coming\n\nthere like that. I didn\u2019t like it. * * * Just giving my daughter just any kind of way to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\f                                   GAL Chris Kimberly\n\n       {\u00b6 94} Kimberly testified she was the GAL appointed to represent appellant\u2019s four\n\nchildren in August 2019, after the previous GAL was reassigned. Kimberly spoke with\n\nthe previous GAL and received notes and a report. Kimberly conducted an independent\n\ninvestigation, and believes it is in J.F.\u2019s best interest for permanent custody to be granted\n\nto LCCS.\n\n       {\u00b6 95} Kimberly had concerns with mother\u2019s ability to parent and manage her\n\nmental health, and there were concerns with father\u2019s ability and willingness to protect J.F.\n\nbecause he believes everything mother says or always takes her side. Kimberly observed\n\nmother and father parent the four children throughout the case, and they have not been\n\n\u201ccapable or able to have gotten all [of] the benefits of services that they really need to\n\nparent safely and effectively.\u201d Mother was \u201cvery, very slow to engage\u201d in some services,\n\nshe completed some services, some she did not do and some she started but did not finish.\n\nKimberly said a therapist suggested mother could benefit from trauma counseling.\n\n       {\u00b6 96} Regarding visits, prior to Kimberly\u2019s involvement, mother and father had\n\nLevel 2 visits with the children at the agency in a room monitored by agency staff. When\n\nKimberly was appointed, the family was at Level 1 visits at the agency with agency staff\n\nsupervising. For a very brief time, the parents had Level 2 visits with J.F., until October\n\n2019, when the incident occurred with the one child. At that point, J.F.\u2019s visits moved\n\nback to Level 1 and the visits with the children were suspended. Mother was really\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\fconsistent with visits while father was a lot less consistent. Before Covid, the GAL\n\nobserved at least three visits between the parents and J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 97} J.F. has developmental issues including tremors, clenching, feeding issues\n\nand eye issues. She is very small and slow to gain weight. J.F. is in need of continuing\n\nservices and someone who is diligent about her medical care Kimberly said in March\n\n2020, at a 90-day review meeting, it was brought up that J.F. has a lazy eye, but mother\n\nsaid no, she does not. The proper eye doctor had to be found, then it took six months to\n\nget an appointment due to Covid, but it was determined there was nothing wrong with\n\nJ.F.\u2019s optic nerve.\n\n       {\u00b6 98} Kimberly does not believe mother has made the progress in services and\n\ngained the understanding needed to be a safe and secure parent. Mother continued to not\n\ntake the safety of the children seriously and mother did not seem to take J.F.\u2019s services\n\nseriously. Kimberly does not think father has fully benefitted from services so that he\n\nwould be able to provide an independent level of protection for J.F. It appears to\n\nKimberly that no matter what evidence exists, father will never believe mother was a\n\ndanger to her children, as father wholeheartedly endorsed her parenting.\n\n       {\u00b6 99} Kimberly was asked about her report, in which it was noted that J.F.\u2019s\n\nmeconium tested positive for THC. The GAL believed that information was in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Kimberly testified housing was the concern that caused LLCS to become\n\ninvolved with the family, but housing is no longer a concern.\n\n\n\n31.\n\f                                Juvenile Court\u2019s Decision\n\n       {\u00b6 101} In its December 23, 2020 judgment entry, the juvenile court found, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), that J.F. could not and\n\nshould not be placed with either parent within a reasonable time, and pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.414(D)(1), it was in the child\u2019s best interest to grant permanent custody to LCCS.\n\n       {\u00b6 102} The court noted the parents secured housing through Empower 1, a three-\n\nyear program, and have been in the program for two years, as of December 2020, and\n\nthere was testimony that the parents are not qualified for independent housing and it does\n\nnot appear they will qualify in the near future. The court referenced caseworkers Costell\n\nand Nicholson\u2019s concerns with mother and father\u2019s ability to parent, and observed that\n\nmother continues to deny she abused the children or negatively impacted them, and father\n\nbelieves the children lied about mother abusing them. The court discussed the parents\u2019\n\nvisits with J.F. The court recognized J.F. has special needs, is on a specialized diet and\n\nhas therapy and doctor appointments.\n\n       {\u00b6 103} The court mentioned the parents\u2019 mental health services, that mother\n\nsuffers from chronic mental illness which is so severe that she is unable to provide an\n\nadequate permanent home for J.F., and mother has difficulty understanding certain\n\nconcepts, like wanting to give J.F. milk when she cannot tolerate it. Father has difficulty\n\nexpressing himself and has tangential and odd thinking, according to his Harbor records.\n\n       {\u00b6 104} The court concluded R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (4), (11) and (14) applied,\n\nand found the following: the parents failed to substantially remedy the problems causing\n\n\n\n32.\n\fJ.F.\u2019s removal, and although the parents made some progress in their case plan services,\n\nthey did not make significant progress to support reunification with J.F., including still\n\nhaving visitation with J.F. under the most restrictive level offered by LCCS; the parents\n\nsuffer from chronic mental illness which is so severe that they are unable to provide an\n\nadequate permanent home for J.F.; the parents demonstrated a lack of commitment to J.F.\n\nby failing to consistently support or visit J.F. or attend her medical and therapy\n\nappointments.; mother had her parental rights to a sibling of the child involuntarily\n\nterminated, and the parents failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that they\n\ncan provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate care for the health,\n\nwelfare and safety of J.F.; the parents are not able to care for J.F.\u2019s basic necessities,\n\nincluding her special needs; and the parents did not make enough progress in their case\n\nplan services to remedy the reasons for removal, including physical abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 105} The court also concluded, under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(a) and (d), that\n\ngranting permanent custody to LCCS is in J.F.\u2019s best interest, and further found: J.F. was\n\ndoing well in her foster home where she has been since birth; J.F. has special needs\n\nwhich are all being met at her current placement; and J.F. needs a legally secure\n\npermanent placement which cannot be achieved without granting permanent custody to\n\nLCCS, as no alternative plan is possible.\n\n                              Standard - Permanent Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 106} The juvenile court may grant permanent custody of a child to a children\n\nservices agency if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) the existence of\n\n\n\n33.\n\fat least one of the four factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) through (d), and (2) the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest is served by granting permanent custody to the agency. In re M.B.,\n\n10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP755, 2005-Ohio-986, \u00b6 6; R.C. 2151.353(A)(4).\n\n       {\u00b6 107} R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) provides that \u201cthe child cannot be placed with\n\neither parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be placed with either\n\nparent.\u201d R.C. 2151.414(E) requires a juvenile court to find that a child cannot be placed\n\nwith either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with\n\neither parent if any one of sixteen factors are met. R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) - (16).\n\n       {\u00b6 108} R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (4), (11) and (14) provide:\n\n              (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home\n\n       and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the\n\n       agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the\n\n       child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and\n\n       repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be\n\n       placed outside the child\u2019s home.\n\n              (2) Chronic mental illness, chronic emotional illness, intellectual\n\n       disability, physical disability, or chemical dependency of the parent that is\n\n       so severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent\n\n       home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year\n\n       after the court holds the hearing * * *;\n\n              ***\n\n\n\n34.\n\f             (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the\n\n      child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child\n\n      when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide\n\n      an adequate permanent home for the child;\n\n             ***\n\n             (11) The parent has had parental rights involuntarily terminated with\n\n      respect to a sibling of the child pursuant to this section or section 2151.353\n\n      or 2151.415 of the Revised Code, or under an existing or former law of this\n\n      state, any other state, or the United States that is substantially equivalent to\n\n      those sections, and the parent has failed to provide clear and convincing\n\n      evidence to prove that, notwithstanding the prior termination, the parent can\n\n      provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate care for the\n\n      health, welfare, and safety of the child.\n\n             ***\n\n             (14) The parent for any reason is unwilling to provide food, clothing,\n\n      shelter, and other basic necessities for the child or to prevent the child from\n\n      suffering physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or physical, emotional, or\n\n      mental neglect.\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\f       {\u00b6 109} To satisfy the best interest prong of the permanent custody test, the\n\nagency must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that permanent custody to the\n\nagency is in the best interest of the child based on an analysis under R.C. 2151.414(D).\n\nThe juvenile court must consider all relevant factors, including: the interaction and\n\ninterrelationship of the child with parents, siblings, relatives and foster caregivers; and\n\nthe child\u2019s need for permanence. See R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(a) and (d).\n\n       {\u00b6 110} Clear and convincing evidence requires proof which \u201cproduce[s] in the\n\nmind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be\n\nestablished.\u201d Cross v. Ledford, 161 Ohio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph\n\nthree of the syllabus. In order to determine whether a juvenile court based its judgment\n\non clear and convincing evidence, the reviewing court examines the record to decide\n\nwhether the trier of fact had sufficient evidence before it to satisfy the appropriate degree\n\nof proof. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990).\n\n                                First Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 111} Mother argues she made sufficient progress in her case plan services to\n\nrebut the presumption that she failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to show\n\nthat she can provide a legally secure placement for J.F. and adequate care for J.F.\u2019s\n\nhealth, welfare and safety, despite the prior termination of parental rights. Mother\n\ncontends she was compliant with her case plan services, including parenting, visitation,\n\nhousing and mental health treatment, and time is \u201cavailable under the statute to address\n\nresidual parenting issues for this child.\u201d Mother submits \u201cshe acknowledged from the\n\n\n\n36.\n\fwitness stand that she had made mistakes in treatment and discipline\u201d of the children.\n\nMother maintains the juvenile court abused its discretion by terminating her parental\n\nrights to J.F.1\n\n       {\u00b6 112} A review of the record shows LCCS established, inter alia, that mother\u2019s\n\nparental rights to the children had been involuntarily terminated. Mother had the burden\n\nof proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that she remedied the condition which\n\ncaused the termination of her parental rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 113} Upon review, we find mother did not present evidence which produced a\n\nfirm belief that she can provide adequate care for J.F.\u2019s health, safety and welfare. While\n\nmother may have been compliant with many of her case plan services, J.F. has special\n\nneeds, not all of which mother has appreciated, and J.F. requires therapies and doctors\u2019\n\nvisits, most of which mother has not attended. Transportation issues were one of the\n\nreasons mother did not take the children for medical care in the previous case, and\n\ntransportation continues to be a problem for mother, as she does not drive.\n\n       {\u00b6 114} In addition, mother has failed to show that she sincerely recognizes and\n\nacknowledges the role she played in traumatizing the children as a result of physically\n\nabusing them. Thus, mother did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that she\n\nremedied the condition which caused the removal of the children and the termination of\n\n\n\n1\n  Abuse of discretion is not the appropriate standard of review in a termination of parental\nrights case. Rather, we review the record to determine whether the juvenile court\u2019s\nfindings are supported by clear and convincing evidence. See In re P.W., 6th Dist. Lucas\nNo. L-12-1060, 2012-Ohio-3556, \u00b6 19.\n\n37.\n\fher parental rights to the children in the previous case. Further, while there may be time\n\nremaining on J.F.\u2019s case, LCCS has been involved with mother for well over two years,\n\nand the same issues remain. Mother has not established that if she were given more time,\n\nshe would rectify the issues.\n\n       {\u00b6 115} Therefore, contrary to mother\u2019s claims, we conclude the juvenile court did\n\nnot commit an error of law, and there was clear and convincing evidence supporting the\n\njuvenile court\u2019s termination of mother\u2019s parental rights to J.F. Accordingly, the first\n\nassignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 116} Father asserts LCCS did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that\n\nJ.F. could not be returned to him, in part because five months were still available to him\n\nduring which J.F. was still eligible for continued temporary custody by LCCS. Father\n\nargues he was compliant with his case plan services, except visits, as he completed a dual\n\ndiagnostic assessment and the classroom portion of parenting classes, he is employed, he\n\nhas stable housing and he has engaged with mental health care providers.\n\n       {\u00b6 117} Father admits his visits were not consistent, but claims there is no\n\nallegation of improper handling of J.F. when he did visit her. Father also acknowledges\n\nhe did not believe the children were truthful when they said mother abused them, and he\n\nnotes he was not a party to the previous case because the children are not his.\n\n       {\u00b6 118} Upon review, we find LCCS did present evidence which produced a firm\n\nbelief that J.F. cannot be returned home to father, as LCCS offered witness testimony that\n\n\n\n38.\n\ffather cannot provide adequate care for J.F.\u2019s health, safety and welfare. Although father\n\nwas somewhat compliant with his case plan services, the progress he made was marginal,\n\nparticularly as it directly relates to J.F. and her care. Father\u2019s visits with J.F. were\n\ninconsistent, and father does not appear to fully comprehend J.F.\u2019s developmental\n\ndisabilities and other medical issues. J.F. has had many therapy and doctors\u2019\n\nappointments, but father attended only one appointment. Just like with mother,\n\ntransportation is an issue for father because he does not drive. What is more, father does\n\nnot seem to believe that mother abused the children, as the majority of the time, he claims\n\nthe children lied about being abused by mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 119} Finally, despite time remaining on J.F.\u2019s case, father has produced no\n\nevidence to suggest that if he were given additional time, he would complete the steps\n\nnecessary to reunify with J.F. Throughout these proceedings, father has shown a lack of\n\nprogress in the areas directly concerning J.F., he failed to participate in all case plan\n\nservices, and he did not consistently acknowledge the abuse suffered by the children at\n\nmother\u2019s hands. Father has been provided with ample opportunity to take corrective steps\n\nand has been unable or unwilling to remedy and improve the situation.\n\n       {\u00b6 120} We therefore conclude the juvenile court did not err when it terminated\n\nfather\u2019s parental rights to J.F. The court considered J.F.\u2019s best interest, and placed her\n\nbest interest above all else. The court properly found, and the record clearly shows, J.F.\u2019s\n\nneed for a legally secure permanent placement could not be achieved without a grant of\n\n\n\n\n39.\n\fpermanent custody to LCCS. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is not well-\n\ntaken.\n\n         {\u00b6 121} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed. Appellants are ordered to pay the court\n\ncosts of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n\n                                                                     Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\f       {\u00b6 2} Appellants set forth two assignments of error:\n\n               I. The trial court abused its discretion when it terminated mother\u2019s\n\n       parental rights, when she had rebutted the presumption against termination\n\n       of rights pursuant to RC 2151.414(E)(11) by becoming and remaining\n\n       complaint [sic] with her case plan services, and when time remained on the\n\n       case.\n\n               II. The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that the minor\n\n       child here could not be returned to her father was not clear and convincing\n\n       with [sic] he was compliant with his mental health services; was employed\n\n       and had stable housing; when no concerns for his parenting were expressed\n\n       at trial; and when time remained on the case.\n\n                                        Background\n\n       {\u00b6 3} Appellant, T.F., is the biological mother (\u201cmother\u201d) of six children, fathered\n\nby different men. The youngest of mother\u2019s children is J.F., who was born in May 2019,\n\nand is the subject of the permanent custody award in this appeal. Appellant, Ja.F., is the\n\nbiological father (\u201cfather\u201d) of only J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} In June 2018, LCCS became involved with mother and three of her children\n\n(\u201cthe children\u201d), as they were homeless. Following an investigation, LCCS learned the\n\nchildren: did not have medical care due to mother\u2019s failure to follow up; were not\n\nregularly attending school; and had been physically abused on a daily basis by mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In July 2018, mother and father were married.\n\n\n\n2.\n\f       {\u00b6 6} On September 26, 2018, LCCS filed a complaint and request for emergency\n\nshelter care in Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, case No.\n\nJC18270763, and interim temporary custody of the children was awarded to LCCS. In\n\nDecember 2018, an adjudication hearing was held, after which two children were found\n\nto be dependent and neglected and the third child was found to be dependent, neglected\n\nand abused. Case plan services were offered including housing, mental health treatment,\n\nsubstance abuse treatment, domestic violence classes and parenting classes. Mother\n\nmostly had supervised, Level 1, visits with the children before her visits were suspended,\n\nin late October 2019, due to concerns with mother: slapping one child; behaving\n\ninappropriately with the children; and attempting to manipulate the children\u2019s\n\ndisclosures. After visits were suspended, the children\u2019s behaviors greatly improved, and\n\nthe children all indicated they did not wish to visit with mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} In July 2020, LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody of the children. In\n\nOctober 2020, a trial was held, and on November 6, 2020, the court issued its judgment\n\nentry awarding permanent custody of the children to LCCS. The court found, inter alia:\n\nmother attempted to comply with the case plan requirements, but failed to take advantage\n\nof the services available to her; mother struggled to accept any responsibility for her\n\nactions and the negative impact her actions had on the children; mother did not\n\nacknowledge the role she played in the children\u2019s removal; mother failed to recognize the\n\ntrauma she inflicted on the children; the children have thrived in substitute care; the\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fchildren\u2019s wishes were to remain out of mother\u2019s care; mother failed to remedy the\n\nproblems that caused the children to be placed outside of the home; mother suffers from a\n\nchronic mental or emotional illness so severe that she is unable to parent the children;\n\nmother demonstrated a lack of commitment to the children by her unwillingness to\n\nprovide an adequate permanent home; and the children were abandoned by their fathers.\n\nMother appealed; the judgment was affirmed. See In re S.W., R.W., J.W., 6th Dist. Lucas\n\nNo. L-20-1204, 2021-Ohio-2065.\n\n        {\u00b6 8} While in the midst of the case with the children, mother gave birth to J.F., in\n\nMay 2019. LCCS filed a complaint in dependency and motion for shelter care hearing in\n\nLucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, case No. JC19274734. A\n\nhearing was held, and interim temporary custody of J.F. was awarded to LCCS.\n\n        {\u00b6 9} On July 15, 2019, mother and father were ordered to pay child support of\n\n$80.00 per month for J.F. On January 16, 2020, mother filed a motion to terminate her\n\nchild support, as she claimed she is actively engaged in case plan service and is unable to\n\nwork.\n\n        {\u00b6 10} On May 20, 2020, mother filed a motion for legal custody of J.F. and to\n\ndetermine support and visitation, and father filed a motion to change disposition and for\n\nlegal custody of J.F. On August 12, 2020, a hearing was held and LCCS was granted an\n\nextension of its temporary custody of J.F.\n\n        {\u00b6 11} On September 23, 2020, LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody of\n\nJ.F. On December 2 and 7, 2020, the dispositional hearing was held, on December 10,\n\n\n\n4.\n\f2020, the court announced its decision, finding LCCS\u2019s motion for permanent custody\n\nwell-taken. On December 23, 2020, the court issued its judgment entry. Mother and\n\nfather appealed.\n\n                                 The Dispositional Hearing\n\n         {\u00b6 12} LCCS called several witnesses to testify, including caseworkers and the\n\nguardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d). Stipulated exhibits were admitted. Mother and father\n\ntestified and called two witnesses. The testimony relevant to the appeal is summarized\n\nbelow.\n\n                                          Therapist\n\n         {\u00b6 13} Berdonna Green testified she is a clinical therapist at Harbor Behavioral\n\nHealth (\u201cHarbor\u201d). She started seeing father in December 2019, and father also had\n\nservices at Harbor when he was a teenager. Father was diagnosed with \u201cBipolar I,\u201d and\n\nparticipates in medication therapy and psychotherapy. Green said father reported\n\nexperiencing some improvement with depression and in managing or coping with stress.\n\n         {\u00b6 14} Green was not sure how long father and mother have been married. Father\n\ntold Green that J.F. was not in his care due to the children. Green had heard that father\n\nfelt sabotaged by one child because that child only thinks of himself and what he can get\n\nout of the foster parents.\n\n         {\u00b6 15} Green has seen father for almost a year and he attended about 85 percent of\n\nhis sessions. In order to complete therapy with Harbor, father would have to report that\n\nhe has three to five coping skills to help him manage his bipolar, and report a reduction in\n\n\n\n5.\n\fhis symptoms. Green said father has reported that he has three coping skills. Green\n\nstated father is on the path to managing his bipolar disorder. Green has weekly team\n\nmeetings with the doctors but there is no firm idea of a timeline for father\u2019s therapy.\n\n                                       Charles Allen\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Allen testified he is the community organizer for Empower 1, which takes\n\nhomeless families and houses them. The program works in three-year increments to help\n\nfamilies restructure their lives, through life planning and financial planning. Typically,\n\nthe program helps families who are together, but mother and father were in a\n\nreunification plan with children services, so it was thought the children would be home\n\nwithin a few months; it is now close to two years. Mother and father \u201cpretty much\u201d\n\nengaged in the life services until Covid, and were given space to finish the classes in their\n\nreunification plan. Empower 1 offers parenting courses, but mother and father had\n\nparenting classes with the reunification plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Empower 1 works with families so they can move into permanent\n\nsupportive housing or fair market housing, but mother and father\u2019s income was not\n\nconsistent, as it was difficult for them to maintain steady work. Mother tried to work on\n\nher obtaining her GED, but no classes were offered due to the pandemic, so she looked\n\nfor work.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Allen said it was \u201cvery difficult to * * * walk [father] through steps to\n\nunderstand a lot of different things, even how to get his pay stub or what a pay stub was.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been working with him on those things.\u201d Father\u2019s jobs were through a\n\n\n\n6.\n\ftemporary agency, so Allen did not know if father could not keep a job because of his\n\ndisability or if the jobs were just short-term. Allen thought it would probably take\n\nanother year for mother and father to be ready for fair market value housing, and he\n\nbelieved the route for them would be more subsidized housing.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Mother and father had two initial courses to take with Empower 1, one\n\ncourse was \u201csort of a life management course which is a lot of time management and how\n\nto schedule and put things down and remember when their appointment was,\u201d and they\n\nalso had to attend biweekly meetings. In the beginning \u201cit got a little rough\u201d for them.\n\nAllen believed with the proper wrap-support services and further education, mother and\n\nfather could maintain a child.\n\n                                 Caseworker Emily Costell\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Costell testified she was an ongoing caseworker when she became involved\n\nwith mother and the children in June 2018, as the family was homeless. Mother and\n\nfather were together for a number of years before they married in July 2018. When\n\nmother and the children were staying at a shelter where father was unable to stay, the\n\nagency received calls that mother was \u201cwhooping\u201d her children and they were screaming\n\nand crying.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Case plan services were offered to mother and father, which included dual\n\ndiagnostic assessments, parenting and getting stable housing. Although mother did what\n\nshe had to do to engage in family therapy, the children were not ready to participate in\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\ffamily trauma therapy. When mother and father found housing, they assumed the\n\nchildren would be returned to them even though the other case plan services had not been\n\nimplemented. This conversation occurred almost monthly, as mother and father did not\n\nunderstand why the children were not returned to them.\n\n      {\u00b6 22} In June 2020, mother acknowledged that she may have been too harsh with\n\nthe children, but by August 2020, when Costell stopped working with the family, mother\n\nsaid she never did anything to the children. Costell said father also acknowledged at one\n\npoint that mother might have gone too far, but he does not always acknowledge it and\n\nusually minimizes mother\u2019s behavior and the risk she presents to the children.\n\n      {\u00b6 23} Mother and father have said the children were removed because they were\n\nblack and Costell was white, money-hungry and corrupt. Mother said she had never done\n\nanything to make the children fearful and she has never harmed them.\n\n      {\u00b6 24} Costell testified at the permanent custody hearing for the children. The\n\nissues which caused mother to lose custody were that she physically abused the children\n\nand she had mental health issues. Costell believed mother did not accept responsibility\n\nfor the trauma the children had gone through.\n\n      {\u00b6 25} Regarding J.F., she was deemed to be dependent, and LCCS received\n\ntemporary custody of her on July 9, 2019. Mother had Level 1 visits at the agency two\n\ndays a week with J.F. Costell observed three of mother\u2019s visits with J.F. and never saw\n\nanything inappropriate. However, Costell received a report from a security officer that in\n\nFebruary 2020, mother was focused on doing J.F.\u2019s hair, but J.F. was crying and\n\n\n\n8.\n\fscreaming. If the security officer looked at mother, she would stop, but if the officer\n\nlooked away, mother would continue to try to do J.F.\u2019s hair.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} When visits became virtual, on Google Duo, because of Covid, the foster\n\nmother reported mother missed visits or was late about six times. Father was not\n\nconsistent in visiting J.F., as he has missed visits and was late. Mother and father\u2019s visits\n\nwith J.F. were never suspended.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Regarding housing, Costell said mother and father have housing, through\n\nEmpower 1, and live in a duplex. The duplex is appropriate and there are no concerns.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} As to father, he was referred in September 2019, to a 12-week parenting\n\nprogram, and he successfully completed the classroom portion in July 2020. He did not\n\ncomplete the observations portion, due to scheduling conflicts and Covid. Costell had\n\nconcerns with father\u2019s parenting ability as it appears he does not understand things that\n\nshe explains to him, so she did not know if he had a mental health issue or a cognitive\n\ndelay. Father also disclosed that mother has some anger issues and has been aggressive\n\nwith the children, but then he denies that he has seen any abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Father was referred in July 2018, to Unison for a dual assessment, which he\n\ncompleted in mid-July 2018. He had to be re-referred in January 2019, because he was\n\nnot following through. Then, in September 2019, he wanted to switch providers and go\n\nto Harbor. He was referred to Harbor in October 2019, and had three assessments\n\nscheduled; he cancelled two and was a no-show for the third. He rescheduled another\n\nassessment, which he attended, and he has been compliant with meeting his therapist.\n\n\n\n9.\n\f       {\u00b6 30} Costell does not think father has progressed far enough in his services to\n\nreunify with J.F. as he still has to work on his mental health, and he is still with mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Costell would have concerns if J.F. were returned to mother soon because\n\nJ.F. has special needs and she is unable to protect herself or report abuse or neglect or\n\nremove herself from those situations. J.F. was referred to Help Me Grow in June 2019,\n\nand is still involved with the program. J.F. has sensory and fine motor skill delays, eating\n\nissues and was referred to an eye specialist. Costell did not believe J.F. would be safe\n\nwith mother, and father would not be able to protect J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} Costell stated J.F. has been in the same foster home, but it is not a potential\n\nadoptive placement. Costell testified LCCS is asking for permanent custody of J.F.\n\n                             Caseworker Rhonda Nicholson\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Nicholson testified she is an ongoing caseworker for LCCS and has been\n\non J.F.\u2019s case since August 2020; case plan services for mother and father were already in\n\neffect. At the time of the hearing, mother still had housing, was engaged in mental health\n\nservices and was attending new parenting classes. Mother started out rocky with the new\n\nparenting classes, as she missed orientation and three appointments. The parent educator\n\ndid not want mother to continue, but Nicholson convinced her to give mother another\n\nchance. Mother has been compliant with the weekly classes since October 16, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Since Nicholson was assigned to the case, mother has had Level 1 visits\n\nwith J.F. Mother never missed a visit, was late or inappropriate. But, Nicholson had\n\nconcerns about mother\u2019s visits with J.F. and her ability to parent J.F. Before mother lost\n\n\n\n10.\n\fcustody of the children, it was reported the children were afraid of mother and did not\n\nwant to return home because of the abuse, but mother denied that she had abused them.\n\nAfter mother lost custody, she did not reach out to arrange a final visit with the children.\n\nNicholson contacted mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Father was still engaged with mental health services, he completed\n\nparenting classes in March 2020, and he has housing. Nicholson had concerns with\n\nfather\u2019s ability to parent and protect J.F. because he blames the children for J.F. not being\n\nhome, he feels one child sabotaged the case, he does not believe mother abused or\n\nneglected the children or acted aggressively with them, and he does not appear to have\n\nany concerns with mother\u2019s parenting style.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} With respect to J.F. being placed with a relative, Nicholson testified that on\n\nher way into court for the hearing, father asked her if she had contacted his aunt and\n\nfather said mother\u2019s adult son may be a potential placement. Nicholson did not know\n\nwhat father was talking about regarding his aunt, and although mother mentioned her\n\nadult son to Nicholson during the first home visit, mother said the previous caseworker\n\ndid not approve of her son because he was verbally aggressive with that caseworker.\n\nNicholson spoke with Emily Costell and learned the son and his girlfriend were both very\n\naggressive at the initial staffing, and the girlfriend refused to undergo a criminal\n\nbackground check. Costell\u2019s supervisor said if the couple was not willing to be cleared\n\nthrough the system, the couple could not be considered for placement.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f       {\u00b6 37} Regarding J.F., she is a one year old with developmental delays, she is\n\nnonverbal and very small for her age. J.F. falls a lot, has balance issues, is startled by\n\nloud noises and has feeding and texture issues. J.F. completed physical therapy before\n\nNicholson was involved, and now has weekly occupational therapy sessions, early\n\nintervention services once a month and she sees a GI doctor. The doctor wants J.F. to try\n\nmilk even though she does not like it.\n\n       {\u00b6 38} The foster mother gives J.F. formula because she is concerned J.F. is not\n\ngetting enough nutrition. Nicholson said the foster mother is very attentive to J.F.\u2019s\n\nneeds. Nicholson talked to mother and father about J.F. not liking certain foods and they\n\nsaid she will probably be a vegetarian as she does not like meat.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Nicholson testified that LCCS is asking for permanent custody of J.F.\n\n                                 Maternal Grandmother\n\n       {\u00b6 40} J.F.\u2019s grandmother testified she met J.F. at the hospital when she was born,\n\nand she stayed about three hours. Grandmother has had no interaction with J.F. since that\n\nday. Grandmother was not sure when J.F. was born.\n\n       {\u00b6 41} Grandmother said mother had six children, including J.F. Regarding the\n\nchildren who were removed from mother\u2019s care, grandmother said mother was a very\n\ngood mother to them, very attentive, she made sure they had something to eat and\n\n\u201csomewhere comfortable to lay their head.\u201d Grandmother had not seen the children in\n\ntwo-and-a-half to three years.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 42} Grandmother thought mother had become a better parent and person\n\n\u201cbecause she wasn\u2019t working * * * when she probably had the kids. Now she is working\n\nand * * * [has] somewhere for them to stay and * * * more money to make sure that they\n\ngot something to eat.\u201d Grandmother retired January 31, 2020, and said she is now able\n\nto help mother. Grandmother thought father was \u201cpretty nice, a pretty nice dude. He was\n\npretty kindhearted * * * a mellow dude.\u201d He was very good to mother, \u201c[b]etter man\n\nthan any of her kids\u2019 father been I think.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Grandmother did not know what mother\u2019s address was, but knows where\n\nmother lives. Grandmother did not know what mother did if the children misbehaved\n\nbecause grandmother \u201cwasn\u2019t really around her like that,\u201d but mother probably believed\n\nin whoopings, as mother was whooped as a child.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Grandmother was asked how often she sees mother and she said \u201cnot real\n\noften, but I talk to her all the time. * * * I don\u2019t drive and she don\u2019t drive so * * * it\u2019s not\n\nthat easy for me to just * * * go get her or go see her.\u201d Before LCCS was involved, \u201cI\n\nthink [mother] lived with me before [J.F.] was born and the kids were little. [Mother]\n\nlived with me for a minute. She stayed with me.\u201d Grandmother said mother and the\n\nchildren lived with her for maybe two or three years, then mother \u201cwanted to get out and\n\nget her own. You know, my apartment wasn\u2019t that big. So I let her stay with me * * *\n\nfor the kids and she could get out and get her own place.\u201d Grandmother knew mother\n\nand the children were homeless, but she did not have them live with her as \u201cI didn\u2019t have\n\nenough room for her and the kids to stay with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n13.\n\f                                    Maternal Great Aunt\n\n         {\u00b6 45} Great aunt to J.F. testified she is mother\u2019s aunt and grandmother\u2019s sister.\n\nGreat aunt met J.F. in the hospital after she was born, and has only seen pictures of her\n\nsince.\n\n         {\u00b6 46} Great aunt saw mother with the children about twice a month and mother\u2019s\n\n\u201ckids were everything to her. * * * And I\u2019m the one that took her to the grocery store and\n\nshe would buy all these groceries, and she said, girl, I got to feed my kids.\u201d Great aunt is\n\nthere for mother, if mother needs a ride or money.\n\n         {\u00b6 47} Great aunt said mother has had a hard life, and did the best she could with\n\nwhat she knew and \u201cwith the kids she did a good job.\u201d Great aunt thought mother was \u201ca\n\nvery good parent.\u201d Grandmother lost custody of mother \u201cwhen [mother] was coming up\n\n* * * [then] she eventually got them back.\u201d Mother and grandmother \u201cthey kind of\n\nclashed heads a little bit for a long time.\u201d Mother\u2019s parents did not have a \u201cvery good\n\nhealthy relationship so [mother] didn\u2019t really know too much about healthy relationships\n\nand how to bring up a person -- or a child.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 48} Great aunt did not know mother\u2019s address, but she has been to the house\n\nseveral times. The last time was when \u201cmy brother got back, and she started using my\n\nbrother because he has a bigger truck for hauling her groceries back and forth.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 49} Great aunt has not seen mother parent the children since \u201cthey took them\n\naway from her.\u201d Great aunt said mother did not have the equipment to bring up a child\n\nbecause mother lost her home, she did not have a job, she lost whatever support she had.\n\n\n\n14.\n\fGreat aunt thought the children were taken from mother because she was homeless.\n\nGreat aunt \u201cwas taking them from hotel to hotel to find them somewhere to stay. I was\n\ntaking them to shelters. And when they would kick her out of a shelter, I would go pick\n\nher up and we would find somewhere else.\u201d Great aunt also thought mother did not have\n\nthe children in school because they did not have their shots and they did not have clothes.\n\n       {\u00b6 50} Great aunt said mother now has the equipment to bring up a child as she\n\nhas a home, it is furnished, she has a husband who has a job and tries to take care of her.\n\nMother has more support now than she did then.\n\n       {\u00b6 51} Great aunt was asked if she knew the children were found to be abused and\n\ngreat aunt said \u201cI don\u2019t think it was by [mother].\u201d Great aunt looked shocked and said\n\nshe never saw mother punish the children. Great aunt said if she found out a child was\n\nabused, that would change her opinion about mother\u2019s ability to parent.\n\n       {\u00b6 52} Great aunt thought father \u201cseems to be a very nice young man, hard\n\nworking. Whenever he gets a job, he did the best he could. He didn\u2019t have any\n\ntransportation so I know at one point he was taking a bike going back and forth to work.\u201d\n\n                                          Mother\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Mother testified J.F. is 17 months old, and LCCS immediately took J.F.\n\nafter she was born. Mother was seeing J.F. twice a week for at least a year at the agency\n\nin a room with a security guard. After Covid, mother saw J.F. once a week virtually, in a\n\nvideo chat over the phone. J.F. met the children at visits at the agency before mother\u2019s\n\nvisits with the children were suspended in October 2019.\n\n\n\n15.\n\f         {\u00b6 54} Mother believed her rights to the children were terminated because she was\n\nnot acknowledging that she had done something wrong. Mother said, \u201cI can\n\nacknowledge and do agree on things that I\u2019ve done wrong and made mistakes toward my\n\nother three kids in which I\u2019ve learned through the parenting class that I\u2019m going through\n\nright now not to do and make the same mistakes again.\u201d Mother said she was \u201c[n]ot\n\ngiving them enough attention, not taking them to they doctor appointments. Not\n\nscheduling appointments, and not making sure I had transportation to get them back and\n\nforth to their appointments, and not being able to keep a roof over their head.\u201d Mother\n\nsaid she has learned \u201c[t]o maintain food, to maintain housing and to maintain the needs,\n\ngoing back and forth to the doctors and making sure her appointments are met and\n\nmaking sure that if I cancel an appointment, that I make sure that I stick to the\n\nappointment. And as well that she makes sure that she gets everything that she desires\n\nand needs and wants.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 55} Mother said she made mistakes when she punished the children, as she did\n\nnot know \u201chow to overcome the overwhelming stress that I was going through and\n\ndealing with.\u201d She learned to deal with stress by going outside, jogging, seeing family,\n\nreading, taking a bath, meditating and listening to music. Before, mother asked\n\ngrandmother to \u201ckeep the kids for a couple of days, * * * just to give me a break from my\n\nkids.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 56} Mother was asked if she heard the testimony about her doing J.F.\u2019s hair and\n\nhow it was traumatic for J.F. Mother said she heard the testimony and \u201cI don\u2019t agree on\n\n\n\n16.\n\fthat, to agree or disagree. I totally outright as much as possible disagree with that\n\nbecause I would never just let my daughter just keep continuing crying and not asking her\n\nif she\u2019s okay or give her a hug or kiss. Her [sic] just to say it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just making you\n\nbeautiful or making you pretty so your hair will be done for the day.\u201d Mother thought\n\nJ.F. \u201cwould be fussing and crying, and she * * * just possibly had got up too early that\n\nmorning. And she be too tired to even want to go through me doing her hair.\u201d Mother\n\nconcluded the foster mother had gotten J.F. up too early.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} Mother did not miss visits but was late to visits \u201c[b]ecause of the time of\n\nme coming from the grocery store or coming from another appointment.\u201d Mother does\n\nnot drive, so she walks, bikes or catches the bus. Mother has worked as a home health\n\naide for almost three months, and is getting her GED. Father also works, and the income\n\nthey make allows them to support themselves. Mother said, \u201cwe making so much money\n\nthey took us off of food stamps because we\u2019re no longer getting food stamps. So we\u2019re\n\nstill able to maintain food without having food stamps.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Mother and father have lived at their home for almost two years, and pay\n\n$400 per month in rent. Mother and father also do volunteer work, a class or a meeting\n\nwith Empower 1 as a requirement for living in the house.\n\n       {\u00b6 59} Mother goes to Harbor for her mental health treatment and she has gone\n\nthere on and off since 2011. She was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder,\n\nbipolar and anxiety. To manage her diagnoses, mother takes medication, plays video\n\ngames, cooks and cleans. Mother was asked if she takes her medicine as prescribed and\n\n\n\n17.\n\fshe said \u201c[y]es, I do.\u201d She was asked if she took her medicine every day and she said\n\n\u201c[y]es, I do.\u201d She was then asked if she missed any doses and she replied \u201cI go maybe\n\nonce -- well, every other day because of the fact of -- because of my job. I don\u2019t want to\n\noversleep and be late for my job because it leads me to being late for my job.\u201d Mother\n\nworks four days a week, 8:00 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mother was asked if she has talked to her\n\ndoctor about the medicine and she replied, \u201c[n]ot lately * * * I plan on letting her know if\n\nI can only take it on a day that I don\u2019t have to work and the days that I don\u2019t have to work\n\nto being able to still have the same -- the same effect.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 60} Mother was asked about the parenting program, in which she had been for\n\nthe last two weeks, and she said she has learned \u201cphysical and verbal * * * redirection * *\n\n* [a]nd * * * how to love your child and not be physically harmful toward your child.\u201d\n\nShe thinks these have helped her be a different parent and keep her child safe and\n\nprotected.\n\n       {\u00b6 61} Mother was asked if she heard testimony that she did not always make the\n\nvirtual visits and she said she heard it, but it was not correct. Mother was asked if she\n\nmissed some virtual visits and she responded \u201cI might have missed a couple of them. * *\n\n* [T]he lady, [foster mother] was supposed to be getting in contact with me between 1\n\nand 1:30. She would call me at around 12, 1:30. She called me at 12:30 at another time\n\nor 1 o\u2019clock and then call me at 12:30 another time. So it varied on what time she would\n\ncall. So I never knew what time she was going to call on a general basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\f        {\u00b6 62} Mother wanted the court to know that \u201cI know how to maintain and\n\nestablish clothing for my daughter, maintain food for my daughter, maintain housing and\n\nmake sure that she\u2019s safe and protected. And as well making sure that she has everything\n\nthat she wants and desires and needs.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 63} On cross-examination, mother said since the hearing a month earlier, she is\n\nno longer smoking marijuana. Mother said she is current with her mental health provider\n\nand she remembers telling her counselor that CSB was keeping the children for the\n\nmoney and her son was being coached. Mother said, \u201c[t]he close-knit relationship with\n\nme and my son before CSB had taken them, me and my son had a relationship that any\n\nmother -- or any mother and son would be jealous of our relationship because of the fact\n\nthat we were so close that my kids could come and talk to me. They could come and\n\nlaugh with me. They could come and play with me. We could do anything together that\n\nno other mother and son would possibly think to even do.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 64} Mother said it was traumatic having the children taken away as \u201cmy kids\n\nare so important to me. And doing their hair, getting their clothes clean, taking them to\n\nthe shopping mall, taking them shopping and going out to eat, and doing fun stuff with\n\nthem and traveling with them is something that I had grew up doing -- was traveling with\n\nmy family every year. That\u2019s something I wanted to do with my kids that I can\u2019t do\n\nnow.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 65} Mother was asked about J.F.\u2019s therapies and she said J.F. went to physical\n\ntherapy and goes to occupational therapy \u201cto get her coordinated to be able to stretch her\n\n\n\n19.\n\fmuscles and being able to relax her hands because she was balling up her hands.\u201d When\n\nasked if those therapies were important for J.F.\u2019s well-being, mother said, \u201cI believe they\n\nknow about [J.F.], but I don\u2019t believe that they know all the time of how [J.F.] could\n\npossibly not drink milk at all. That\u2019s the part I\u2019m not understanding why she\u2019s not\n\ndrinking milk. But she is in some form of drinking milk, but it\u2019s not the type of milk that\n\nI\u2019m drinking or her dad is drinking that it would help her bones become stronger so as\n\nshe grows. Her bones will become stronger instead of brittle.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 66} Mother was asked about J.F.\u2019s eyes and mother said, \u201cher left eye she has --\n\nI believe it\u2019s a stigmatism. I don\u2019t know. She told me before it could be, and the doctor\n\ntold her it would be possibly a tumor. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a tumor. I believe it\u2019s a\n\nstigmatism that she possibly have in her eye, and she genetically got from me from my\n\nyoung age that I received a stigmatism in my eye. And she\u2019s not able to get the one eye\n\nto be able to look straight like I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d Mother said she asked the foster\n\nmother about J.F.\u2019s eye treatment, \u201cand it, like, goes in one ear and other the other.\u201d\n\nMother was asked if she recalled saying she did not notice anything wrong with J.F.\u2019s\n\neyes, and she said, \u201cI have pictures where she is not seen with a lazy eye. Her eye is not\n\ncrossing. Her eyes looked at me like I\u2019m looking at you. And plus my husband has --\n\nhe\u2019s a first (sic) so I know -- pretty much know my daughter will be looked after.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 67} Mother said J.F. sees a GI doctor for her stomach \u201c[b]ecause from my\n\nunderstanding * * * she couldn\u2019t stand the taste of textures, or she couldn\u2019t eat meat or\n\nshe just didn\u2019t want to eat meat.\u201d Mother recalled that J.F. had problems tolerating\n\n\n\n20.\n\fformulas. Mother said when J.F. goes home \u201c[i]f [J.F.] she can tolerate milk, there\u2019s a\n\ncertain kind of milk I can give her. I wouldn\u2019t force her to drink milk if she can\u2019t drink\n\nmilk. But if she can drink milk, yes, I will give my daughter milk so, therefore, she will\n\nhave some milk that will strengthen her bones.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 68} Mother said at one time \u201cI did think that she wouldn\u2019t need them other\n\ntherapies, but being that I see that she has special needs, yes, she do need * * * them.\u201d\n\nMother changed her mind \u201cwhen I seen my daughter * * * have a patch over her eye and\n\nunderstanding that. * * * It\u2019s making it strong.\u201d\n\n                                           Father\n\n       {\u00b6 69} Father testified he is married to mother and \u201cI\u2019ve been living with her for a\n\nwhile now, like, what is it, two years.\u201d J.F. is their child and mother \u201chad two older boys,\n\nand they grown now so -- they\u2019re -- you know, they pretty much -- they don\u2019t say too\n\nmuch bad about their mother as much as they don\u2019t really, like, you know try to -- they\n\ndon\u2019t try to -- they don\u2019t really try to say anything bad about their mother last time I\n\nchecked.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 70} Father was asked, \u201c[t]here are three other children?\u201d Father replied, \u201c[y]ou\n\nsaid three other children? No. No. No. There weren\u2019t.\u201d He was then asked \u201cso when\n\n[LCCS] initially got involved with [mother\u2019s] other children, that was before you[?]\u201d He\n\nsaid \u201c[t]hat was the time when we were separated. When we got in -- they said we got in\n\na little proclaimed altercation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n21.\n\f       {\u00b6 71} Regarding his understanding of LCCS\u2019s reasons for removing the children,\n\nfather said, \u201c[w]ell, when it came down to that, I knew very well. And I witnessed a lot\n\nof things that were going on at the time when we were living in shelters. And what they\n\nwere pretty much saying was that somebody pretty much -- somebody that was next door\n\nto us that was, like, a resident at the shelter at that time pretty much said that -- and I\n\nwasn\u2019t there but when I was there, I didn\u2019t see none of the stuff go on.\u201d Father was asked\n\nthe question again, he said, \u201c[w]ell, their concern I feel like they should have did, like,\n\nmore research before they just took them the way I see it.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 72} Father stated LCCS\u2019s allegations were abuse and neglect, but \u201chow can\n\nsomebody neglect somebody if they keeping their eyes on them 24/7? * * * And then\n\nwhen it come down to abuse, when you all say abuse, I understand the mother, you know,\n\nif she choked the child or tried to kill the child or anything like that. But none of that\n\nstuff never happened.\u201d Regarding concerns with physical abuse, father stated, \u201c[t]o be\n\nhonest, she probably disciplined them, but it wasn\u2019t major. It was more like a warning,\n\nlike, don\u2019t do this again like any mother would do. I mean my momma did it.\u201d Father\n\nwas asked what the physical abuse incidents were and he said, \u201c[t]he incidents that pretty\n\nmuch happened -- I am going to be honest. Me and her used to get in arguments, and the\n\nkids used to see that. Yes, we had a rough relationship at one time. Yes, we had a lot of\n\nthings going on. Yes, she probably got too bothered about certain things. She was\n\nprobably stressing and over the edge, but at the same time I always used to work things\n\nout with her and her kids. There were times when I come out my pocket and she\u2019ll come\n\n\n\n22.\n\fout her pocket, and we\u2019ll feed them. There were times when we would just go to\n\nGoodwill because I was budgeting on the checks that I was getting.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 73} Father thought mother was a really good mother, so he cannot say that her\n\none child was abused. Father said he heard the caseworkers\u2019 testimony that he did not\n\nunderstand or believe the allegations or concerns, but he \u201cunderstood everything. But at\n\nthe same time I\u2019ve got to go by the beliefs of the child, and that\u2019s understandable. I can\n\ndo that. But if it\u2019s nothing truthful in that, you all -- you know, you all remember the\n\nsituation to my rights of the constitution. What else can I say?\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 74} Father said he was concerned because he talked to the one child who said\n\nhe lost his virginity and had sex with a 24-year old. \u201cSo it was like at that time I had to\n\nreally, you know, remind myself that this lady ain\u2019t really paying attention like she\u2019s\n\nsupposed to. * * * LCCS, they got to be responsible and accountable for even allowing\n\nthat to happen.\u201d Father raised the concern because he wants the court to know \u201cI think\n\nit\u2019s a lot of re-appealing we are doing with case. Because those ain\u2019t my biological kids,\n\nbut for my concern for her, I just wish, you know, they can change this whole matter and\n\ndo this case over again. You know, to really do their studies on it and really get to know\n\nthe kids more. Because kids going to tell anybody anything. I was once a kid as well.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 75} Father was offered case plan services when LCCS first became involved\n\nwith mother and the children because he was married to her and they lived together. He\n\nsaid, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna to lie, I probably didn\u2019t come to every last one of them * * * Emily\n\nCostell was giving me my stuff last minute. * * * [S]he really didn\u2019t want to put me on\n\n\n\n23.\n\fthe case for real when her kids got tooken (sic) away.\u201d Case plan services continued after\n\nJ.F. was born, with reunification as the goal.\n\n       {\u00b6 76} Father did not always agree with how mother disciplined the children, \u201cshe\n\ngot this thing, you know, with her that kind of creeped me out. When she got, you know,\n\nmad at me when I asked her, you know, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do this, it wasn\u2019t like abuse\n\nor nothing like that. It was just the way she used to get mad at the kids * * * she\u2019ll get --\n\nnot violent with them. She would cuss them out, so I would say, no, don\u2019t do that * * *\n\ndon\u2019t yell at your child.\u201d Father felt like mother would cherish and nourish J.F. because\n\nmother \u201ccame a long way. Just to be honest with you all, * * * she been doing -- you\n\nknow, she was doing fine. Plus she understands well what she did wrong on some things.\n\nBut somebody who put abuse and neglect still doesn\u2019t make it right, putting something on\n\nsomeone knowing it\u2019s not true.\u201d Father said he will protect J.F., as she is his first child.\n\n       {\u00b6 77} Father said visits were going well until one child \u201cmade the allegation that\n\nher mother allegedly smacked her. * * * [H]ow can you smack somebody when there\u2019s\n\nfull of cameras? * * * [H]ow can the mother smack the child * * * It just -- it\u2019s\n\npropaganda.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 78} Father was diagnosed with bipolar during J.F.\u2019s case, and he takes\n\nmedication which keeps him content. Father agreed with his therapist\u2019s report, but he\n\nwas surprised that she had not had a conversation with the doctor and treatment team.\n\nFather thought if the therapist had the conversation and he had successfully completed his\n\nmental health care, that would have impacted how LCCS viewed his progress. Father\n\n\n\n24.\n\fbelieved it would have taken his therapist to say that he had coping skills in order for\n\nLCCS to say he had successfully completed mental health services, but she did not testify\n\nabout that. Father said he would continue his therapy, as he is starting to like it because\n\nhe has someone he can talk to about his problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 79} Father said Rhonda Nicholson told him LCCS\u2019s concerns were \u201cmy wife.\n\nAin\u2019t no -- ain\u2019t nothing regarding me. It\u2019s something that LCCS not appreciating what\n\nmy wife did. All she did was speak her mind about some things, and you see what\n\nhappened.\u201d Father said he did everything that he was supposed to do, \u201c[m]y daughter got\n\nwipes, * * * Pampers, * * * a bed. * * * What is the problem?\u201d Father stated he learned\n\nabout safety measures, how to protect his daughter, and patience.\n\n       {\u00b6 80} Father said there was \u201c[n]o proof\u201d of domestic violence between him and\n\nmother. Regarding housing, father said \u201c[s]ome people say it\u2019s housing assisting, but how\n\nis it house assisting when I pay rent and lights and gas? It\u2019s not for free.\u201d Father believes\n\nhe can maintain housing. He was asked about getting independent housing, and father\n\nsaid, \u201cjust me staying at the place right now, that\u2019s independently done. * * * [Y]es it\u2019s a\n\nprogram, but it teach you how to manage your own well being.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 81} Father is currently employed and is still trying to get his GED. When he\n\ngets paid, the temporary employment agency takes half \u201cplus the state child support is\n\ntaking my money too. Every time I get a job, they take about $80 or maybe like $115.\u201d\n\nFather believes he is in a position to take custody of J.F. As to other services which may\n\nbe needed, father said, \u201cone thing based on what I\u2019m hearing, that she do need special\n\n\n\n25.\n\fneeds for her eye doctor, you know, dental sooner or later. Because she\u2019s getting bigger.\n\nBased on her eating, there\u2019s a good chance she might be vegan.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 82} On cross-examination, father said he had proof that the children were not\n\nabused, but \u201cnot physical evidence.\u201d Father feels railroaded by LCCS because some of\n\nthe allegations made by the children against mother were not true and the children were\n\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d taking advantage of their situation with the foster parents. Father does not\n\nbelieve mother smacked the child during a visit. Father does not like Lucas County\n\nChild Support taking money out of his paycheck \u201c[b]ecause that\u2019s not my baby mama.\n\nThat\u2019s her right there.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 83} Father said his sisters could watch J.F. while he is working. He was asked\n\nwhere his sisters lived and he said, \u201c[o]ne of my sisters -- I ain\u2019t going to lie. To be\n\nhonest, she live in the Greenbelt. And then I have another sister, and she live in the\n\nGreenbelt as well.\u201d Father said a lot of people talk bad about the Greenbelt apartments.\n\n       {\u00b6 84} On further cross-examination, father said when he married mother they\n\nwere homeless. Father admitted he was kicked out of a shelter \u201c[b]ecause of arguing that\n\ntook place.\u201d When the children were removed from mother\u2019s care, father was on the case\n\nplan, but the caseworker would not let father visit the children. Father heard one child\n\nwas deemed to be an abused child, but \u201cwhen you all said that my wife had burnt him --\n\nwell, somebody said it. Somebody said that they had checked a burnt mark on his back\n\nsaying that, I guess, she burned him, and that wasn\u2019t even true. * * * He burnt himself.\u201d\n\nFather said the finding of abuse was wrong and \u201c[i]f you\u2019re feeding your kid and clothing\n\n\n\n26.\n\fyou kid and they have a roof over then head, that\u2019s not mistreated. But sometimes\n\nparents have to discipline they kids. By law you can hit the child in the buttocks, but not\n\nwith a belt but you hand.\u201d Father acknowledged the children were not seeing doctors\n\nbecause of transportation problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 85} Regarding reports made by the children, father said \u201cyes, you supposed to\n\nbelieve the child, yes. Yes, that\u2019s absolutely true. You supposed to believe the child if\n\nthey got -- if it comes down to abuse, molestation, whatever the case is. But if it\u2019s not\n\naccurate enough and if you know it\u2019s not accurate enough and you know, it just a whole\n\nlittle game of propaganda that you all playing with, yeah, it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d As\n\nto the child who said she was slapped by mother during a visit, \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t play any little\n\ngames with your momma based on telling any story.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 86} Father said LCCS filed the permanent custody motion because mother\n\nspoke her mind and father \u201cnot agreeing with half of the things that you all saying.\u201d\n\nRegarding his concerns about the one child having sex, father was asked if he called the\n\nagency to report it and he responded \u201c[n]o, not at that time. Well, as a matter of fact I\n\ndid, but nobody ever answered. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, right. Nobody ever\n\ndid answer. If you\u2019re talking about -- or are you talking about me talking about -- [?]\u201d\n\nAlso, father did not raise the issue at the 90-day review meeting in June 2020, or with the\n\ncaseworker because he did not think he would be believed.\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\f                          Foster Mother and Parents\u2019 Rebuttal\n\n       {\u00b6 87} Foster mother testified she has fostered children for 50 years, and has been\n\ncaring for J.F. since she was released from the hospital at two days old. J.F.\u2019s difficulties\n\nupon leaving the hospital included tremors for the first few months and feeding issues of\n\ngagging and vomiting, she could not tolerate milk, she was weak on one side and she\n\ncould only roll to one side; J.F. was listed as failure to thrive. The agency recommended\n\nHelp Me Grow for J.F., and she was referred to a gastrointestinal doctor, physical therapy\n\nand occupational therapy for her feeding and sensory issues and deficits. Foster mother\n\ntakes J.F. to appointments and to twice-a-week visitations with mother and father.\n\n       {\u00b6 88} J.F. had an MRI after foster mother noticed problems with J.F.\u2019s eyes and\n\nthe pediatrician sent J.F. to an eye doctor. J.F. saw the eye doctor in October 2020, and\n\nthe doctor thought there may be issues with the optical nerve not getting the right blood\n\nsupply. J.F. was prescribed glasses and an eye patch.\n\n       {\u00b6 89} Foster mother talked to mother and father about J.F.\u2019s services, but\n\n\u201cwhenever I would bring up anything, the only response I got was if she were with me,\n\nshe wouldn\u2019t have these issues or I don\u2019t see these issues.\u201d When mother and father were\n\nallowed to go to J.F.\u2019s appointments, foster mother would tell them about the\n\nappointments, yet mother said she was never told, so the caseworker had foster mother\n\nwrite a list of the appointments for mother. Mother and father went to one appointment,\n\nfor the GI doctor, although there were at least six appointments on the list. Thereafter,\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\fmother and father did not ask about J.F.\u2019s services, her MRI results or why she had a\n\npatch on her glasses.\n\n       {\u00b6 90} Foster mother said father told her that CSB was against him, and the\n\nchildren made up all of the stories about mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 91} Mother testified, in rebuttal, that foster mother told her about four of J.F.\u2019s\n\nappointments, but mother \u201chad meetings on the days that she [foster mother] set doctor\n\nappointments. One I was able to get to, the other one right before the pandemic had\n\npretty much sent me to not being able to go because I had other appointments to go to.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 92} Mother had concerns that J.F. was not drinking milk, and nobody has\n\nhelped to alleviate those concerns. Mother also had issues with the way the foster mother\n\ntook care of J.F. because sometimes J.F. would have on dirty clothes that had not been\n\nwashed, and when mother would change J.F.\u2019s diaper she would \u201cstill have stuff in\n\nbetween her legs.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 93} Father testified, in rebuttal, that his main concern was that J.F. would come\n\nto visits with \u201cnot good hygiene,\u201d and \u201c[t]here were times where it felt like the clothes\n\nthat she was wearing was already wore before or after. There were times when she\n\nwould come with * * * snotty nose, * * * face, all crusty. * * * I believe a kid, you know,\n\nshould be nourished by their hygiene even down to their skin. Plus my daughter got\n\nmelanin, so it\u2019s important.\u201d Father stated \u201c[i]t was just my main concern her coming\n\nthere like that. I didn\u2019t like it. * * * Just giving my daughter just any kind of way to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\f                                   GAL Chris Kimberly\n\n       {\u00b6 94} Kimberly testified she was the GAL appointed to represent appellant\u2019s four\n\nchildren in August 2019, after the previous GAL was reassigned. Kimberly spoke with\n\nthe previous GAL and received notes and a report. Kimberly conducted an independent\n\ninvestigation, and believes it is in J.F.\u2019s best interest for permanent custody to be granted\n\nto LCCS.\n\n       {\u00b6 95} Kimberly had concerns with mother\u2019s ability to parent and manage her\n\nmental health, and there were concerns with father\u2019s ability and willingness to protect J.F.\n\nbecause he believes everything mother says or always takes her side. Kimberly observed\n\nmother and father parent the four children throughout the case, and they have not been\n\n\u201ccapable or able to have gotten all [of] the benefits of services that they really need to\n\nparent safely and effectively.\u201d Mother was \u201cvery, very slow to engage\u201d in some services,\n\nshe completed some services, some she did not do and some she started but did not finish.\n\nKimberly said a therapist suggested mother could benefit from trauma counseling.\n\n       {\u00b6 96} Regarding visits, prior to Kimberly\u2019s involvement, mother and father had\n\nLevel 2 visits with the children at the agency in a room monitored by agency staff. When\n\nKimberly was appointed, the family was at Level 1 visits at the agency with agency staff\n\nsupervising. For a very brief time, the parents had Level 2 visits with J.F., until October\n\n2019, when the incident occurred with the one child. At that point, J.F.\u2019s visits moved\n\nback to Level 1 and the visits with the children were suspended. Mother was really\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\fconsistent with visits while father was a lot less consistent. Before Covid, the GAL\n\nobserved at least three visits between the parents and J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 97} J.F. has developmental issues including tremors, clenching, feeding issues\n\nand eye issues. She is very small and slow to gain weight. J.F. is in need of continuing\n\nservices and someone who is diligent about her medical care Kimberly said in March\n\n2020, at a 90-day review meeting, it was brought up that J.F. has a lazy eye, but mother\n\nsaid no, she does not. The proper eye doctor had to be found, then it took six months to\n\nget an appointment due to Covid, but it was determined there was nothing wrong with\n\nJ.F.\u2019s optic nerve.\n\n       {\u00b6 98} Kimberly does not believe mother has made the progress in services and\n\ngained the understanding needed to be a safe and secure parent. Mother continued to not\n\ntake the safety of the children seriously and mother did not seem to take J.F.\u2019s services\n\nseriously. Kimberly does not think father has fully benefitted from services so that he\n\nwould be able to provide an independent level of protection for J.F. It appears to\n\nKimberly that no matter what evidence exists, father will never believe mother was a\n\ndanger to her children, as father wholeheartedly endorsed her parenting.\n\n       {\u00b6 99} Kimberly was asked about her report, in which it was noted that J.F.\u2019s\n\nmeconium tested positive for THC. The GAL believed that information was in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Kimberly testified housing was the concern that caused LLCS to become\n\ninvolved with the family, but housing is no longer a concern.\n\n\n\n31.\n\f                                Juvenile Court\u2019s Decision\n\n       {\u00b6 101} In its December 23, 2020 judgment entry, the juvenile court found, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), that J.F. could not and\n\nshould not be placed with either parent within a reasonable time, and pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.414(D)(1), it was in the child\u2019s best interest to grant permanent custody to LCCS.\n\n       {\u00b6 102} The court noted the parents secured housing through Empower 1, a three-\n\nyear program, and have been in the program for two years, as of December 2020, and\n\nthere was testimony that the parents are not qualified for independent housing and it does\n\nnot appear they will qualify in the near future. The court referenced caseworkers Costell\n\nand Nicholson\u2019s concerns with mother and father\u2019s ability to parent, and observed that\n\nmother continues to deny she abused the children or negatively impacted them, and father\n\nbelieves the children lied about mother abusing them. The court discussed the parents\u2019\n\nvisits with J.F. The court recognized J.F. has special needs, is on a specialized diet and\n\nhas therapy and doctor appointments.\n\n       {\u00b6 103} The court mentioned the parents\u2019 mental health services, that mother\n\nsuffers from chronic mental illness which is so severe that she is unable to provide an\n\nadequate permanent home for J.F., and mother has difficulty understanding certain\n\nconcepts, like wanting to give J.F. milk when she cannot tolerate it. Father has difficulty\n\nexpressing himself and has tangential and odd thinking, according to his Harbor records.\n\n       {\u00b6 104} The court concluded R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (4), (11) and (14) applied,\n\nand found the following: the parents failed to substantially remedy the problems causing\n\n\n\n32.\n\fJ.F.\u2019s removal, and although the parents made some progress in their case plan services,\n\nthey did not make significant progress to support reunification with J.F., including still\n\nhaving visitation with J.F. under the most restrictive level offered by LCCS; the parents\n\nsuffer from chronic mental illness which is so severe that they are unable to provide an\n\nadequate permanent home for J.F.; the parents demonstrated a lack of commitment to J.F.\n\nby failing to consistently support or visit J.F. or attend her medical and therapy\n\nappointments.; mother had her parental rights to a sibling of the child involuntarily\n\nterminated, and the parents failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that they\n\ncan provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate care for the health,\n\nwelfare and safety of J.F.; the parents are not able to care for J.F.\u2019s basic necessities,\n\nincluding her special needs; and the parents did not make enough progress in their case\n\nplan services to remedy the reasons for removal, including physical abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 105} The court also concluded, under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(a) and (d), that\n\ngranting permanent custody to LCCS is in J.F.\u2019s best interest, and further found: J.F. was\n\ndoing well in her foster home where she has been since birth; J.F. has special needs\n\nwhich are all being met at her current placement; and J.F. needs a legally secure\n\npermanent placement which cannot be achieved without granting permanent custody to\n\nLCCS, as no alternative plan is possible.\n\n                              Standard - Permanent Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 106} The juvenile court may grant permanent custody of a child to a children\n\nservices agency if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) the existence of\n\n\n\n33.\n\fat least one of the four factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) through (d), and (2) the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest is served by granting permanent custody to the agency. In re M.B.,\n\n10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP755, 2005-Ohio-986, \u00b6 6; R.C. 2151.353(A)(4).\n\n       {\u00b6 107} R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) provides that \u201cthe child cannot be placed with\n\neither parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be placed with either\n\nparent.\u201d R.C. 2151.414(E) requires a juvenile court to find that a child cannot be placed\n\nwith either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with\n\neither parent if any one of sixteen factors are met. R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) - (16).\n\n       {\u00b6 108} R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (4), (11) and (14) provide:\n\n              (1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home\n\n       and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the\n\n       agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the\n\n       child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and\n\n       repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be\n\n       placed outside the child\u2019s home.\n\n              (2) Chronic mental illness, chronic emotional illness, intellectual\n\n       disability, physical disability, or chemical dependency of the parent that is\n\n       so severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent\n\n       home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year\n\n       after the court holds the hearing * * *;\n\n              ***\n\n\n\n34.\n\f             (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the\n\n      child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child\n\n      when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide\n\n      an adequate permanent home for the child;\n\n             ***\n\n             (11) The parent has had parental rights involuntarily terminated with\n\n      respect to a sibling of the child pursuant to this section or section 2151.353\n\n      or 2151.415 of the Revised Code, or under an existing or former law of this\n\n      state, any other state, or the United States that is substantially equivalent to\n\n      those sections, and the parent has failed to provide clear and convincing\n\n      evidence to prove that, notwithstanding the prior termination, the parent can\n\n      provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate care for the\n\n      health, welfare, and safety of the child.\n\n             ***\n\n             (14) The parent for any reason is unwilling to provide food, clothing,\n\n      shelter, and other basic necessities for the child or to prevent the child from\n\n      suffering physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or physical, emotional, or\n\n      mental neglect.\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\f       {\u00b6 109} To satisfy the best interest prong of the permanent custody test, the\n\nagency must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that permanent custody to the\n\nagency is in the best interest of the child based on an analysis under R.C. 2151.414(D).\n\nThe juvenile court must consider all relevant factors, including: the interaction and\n\ninterrelationship of the child with parents, siblings, relatives and foster caregivers; and\n\nthe child\u2019s need for permanence. See R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(a) and (d).\n\n       {\u00b6 110} Clear and convincing evidence requires proof which \u201cproduce[s] in the\n\nmind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be\n\nestablished.\u201d Cross v. Ledford, 161 Ohio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph\n\nthree of the syllabus. In order to determine whether a juvenile court based its judgment\n\non clear and convincing evidence, the reviewing court examines the record to decide\n\nwhether the trier of fact had sufficient evidence before it to satisfy the appropriate degree\n\nof proof. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990).\n\n                                First Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 111} Mother argues she made sufficient progress in her case plan services to\n\nrebut the presumption that she failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to show\n\nthat she can provide a legally secure placement for J.F. and adequate care for J.F.\u2019s\n\nhealth, welfare and safety, despite the prior termination of parental rights. Mother\n\ncontends she was compliant with her case plan services, including parenting, visitation,\n\nhousing and mental health treatment, and time is \u201cavailable under the statute to address\n\nresidual parenting issues for this child.\u201d Mother submits \u201cshe acknowledged from the\n\n\n\n36.\n\fwitness stand that she had made mistakes in treatment and discipline\u201d of the children.\n\nMother maintains the juvenile court abused its discretion by terminating her parental\n\nrights to J.F.1\n\n       {\u00b6 112} A review of the record shows LCCS established, inter alia, that mother\u2019s\n\nparental rights to the children had been involuntarily terminated. Mother had the burden\n\nof proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that she remedied the condition which\n\ncaused the termination of her parental rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 113} Upon review, we find mother did not present evidence which produced a\n\nfirm belief that she can provide adequate care for J.F.\u2019s health, safety and welfare. While\n\nmother may have been compliant with many of her case plan services, J.F. has special\n\nneeds, not all of which mother has appreciated, and J.F. requires therapies and doctors\u2019\n\nvisits, most of which mother has not attended. Transportation issues were one of the\n\nreasons mother did not take the children for medical care in the previous case, and\n\ntransportation continues to be a problem for mother, as she does not drive.\n\n       {\u00b6 114} In addition, mother has failed to show that she sincerely recognizes and\n\nacknowledges the role she played in traumatizing the children as a result of physically\n\nabusing them. Thus, mother did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that she\n\nremedied the condition which caused the removal of the children and the termination of\n\n\n\n1\n  Abuse of discretion is not the appropriate standard of review in a termination of parental\nrights case. Rather, we review the record to determine whether the juvenile court\u2019s\nfindings are supported by clear and convincing evidence. See In re P.W., 6th Dist. Lucas\nNo. L-12-1060, 2012-Ohio-3556, \u00b6 19.\n\n37.\n\fher parental rights to the children in the previous case. Further, while there may be time\n\nremaining on J.F.\u2019s case, LCCS has been involved with mother for well over two years,\n\nand the same issues remain. Mother has not established that if she were given more time,\n\nshe would rectify the issues.\n\n       {\u00b6 115} Therefore, contrary to mother\u2019s claims, we conclude the juvenile court did\n\nnot commit an error of law, and there was clear and convincing evidence supporting the\n\njuvenile court\u2019s termination of mother\u2019s parental rights to J.F. Accordingly, the first\n\nassignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 116} Father asserts LCCS did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that\n\nJ.F. could not be returned to him, in part because five months were still available to him\n\nduring which J.F. was still eligible for continued temporary custody by LCCS. Father\n\nargues he was compliant with his case plan services, except visits, as he completed a dual\n\ndiagnostic assessment and the classroom portion of parenting classes, he is employed, he\n\nhas stable housing and he has engaged with mental health care providers.\n\n       {\u00b6 117} Father admits his visits were not consistent, but claims there is no\n\nallegation of improper handling of J.F. when he did visit her. Father also acknowledges\n\nhe did not believe the children were truthful when they said mother abused them, and he\n\nnotes he was not a party to the previous case because the children are not his.\n\n       {\u00b6 118} Upon review, we find LCCS did present evidence which produced a firm\n\nbelief that J.F. cannot be returned home to father, as LCCS offered witness testimony that\n\n\n\n38.\n\ffather cannot provide adequate care for J.F.\u2019s health, safety and welfare. Although father\n\nwas somewhat compliant with his case plan services, the progress he made was marginal,\n\nparticularly as it directly relates to J.F. and her care. Father\u2019s visits with J.F. were\n\ninconsistent, and father does not appear to fully comprehend J.F.\u2019s developmental\n\ndisabilities and other medical issues. J.F. has had many therapy and doctors\u2019\n\nappointments, but father attended only one appointment. Just like with mother,\n\ntransportation is an issue for father because he does not drive. What is more, father does\n\nnot seem to believe that mother abused the children, as the majority of the time, he claims\n\nthe children lied about being abused by mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 119} Finally, despite time remaining on J.F.\u2019s case, father has produced no\n\nevidence to suggest that if he were given additional time, he would complete the steps\n\nnecessary to reunify with J.F. Throughout these proceedings, father has shown a lack of\n\nprogress in the areas directly concerning J.F., he failed to participate in all case plan\n\nservices, and he did not consistently acknowledge the abuse suffered by the children at\n\nmother\u2019s hands. Father has been provided with ample opportunity to take corrective steps\n\nand has been unable or unwilling to remedy and improve the situation.\n\n       {\u00b6 120} We therefore conclude the juvenile court did not err when it terminated\n\nfather\u2019s parental rights to J.F. The court considered J.F.\u2019s best interest, and placed her\n\nbest interest above all else. The court properly found, and the record clearly shows, J.F.\u2019s\n\nneed for a legally secure permanent placement could not be achieved without a grant of\n\n\n\n\n39.\n\fpermanent custody to LCCS. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is not well-\n\ntaken.\n\n         {\u00b6 121} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed. Appellants are ordered to pay the court\n\ncosts of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n\n                                                                     Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\f       {\u00b6 2} Appellants set forth two assignments of error:\n\n               I. The trial court abused its discretion when it terminated mother\u2019s\n\n       parental rights, when she had rebutted the presumption against termination\n\n       of rights pursuant to RC 2151.414(E)(11) by becoming and remaining\n\n       complaint [sic] with her case plan services, and when time remained on the\n\n       case.\n\n               II. The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that the minor\n\n       child here could not be returned to her father was not clear and convincing\n\n       with [sic] he was compliant with his mental health services; was employed\n\n       and had stable housing; when no concerns for his parenting were expressed\n\n       at trial; and when time remained on the case.\n\n                                        Background\n\n       {\u00b6 3} Appellant, T.F., is the biological mother (\u201cmother\u201d) of six children, fathered\n\nby different men. The youngest of mother\u2019s children is J.F., who was born in May 2019,\n\nand is the subject of the permanent custody award in this appeal. Appellant, Ja.F., is the\n\nbiological father (\u201cfather\u201d) of only J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} In June 2018, LCCS became involved with mother and three of her children\n\n(\u201cthe children\u201d), as they were homeless. Following an investigation, LCCS learned the\n\nchildren: did not have medical care due to mother\u2019s failure to follow up; were not\n\nregularly attending school; and had been physically abused on a daily basis by mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In July 2018, mother and father were married.\n\n\n\n2.\n\f       {\u00b6 6} On September 26, 2018, LCCS filed a complaint and request for emergency\n\nshelter care in Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, case No.\n\nJC18270763, and interim temporary custody of the children was awarded to LCCS. In\n\nDecember 2018, an adjudication hearing was held, after which two children were found\n\nto be dependent and neglected and the third child was found to be dependent, neglected\n\nand abused. Case plan services were offered including housing, mental health treatment,\n\nsubstance abuse treatment, domestic violence classes and parenting classes. Mother\n\nmostly had supervised, Level 1, visits with the children before her visits were suspended,\n\nin late October 2019, due to concerns with mother: slapping one child; behaving\n\ninappropriately with the children; and attempting to manipulate the children\u2019s\n\ndisclosures. After visits were suspended, the children\u2019s behaviors greatly improved, and\n\nthe children all indicated they did not wish to visit with mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} In July 2020, LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody of the children. In\n\nOctober 2020, a trial was held, and on November 6, 2020, the court issued its judgment\n\nentry awarding permanent custody of the children to LCCS. The court found, inter alia:\n\nmother attempted to comply with the case plan requirements, but failed to take advantage\n\nof the services available to her; mother struggled to accept any responsibility for her\n\nactions and the negative impact her actions had on the children; mother did not\n\nacknowledge the role she played in the children\u2019s removal; mother failed to recognize the\n\ntrauma she inflicted on the children; the children have thrived in substitute care; the\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\fchildren\u2019s wishes were to remain out of mother\u2019s care; mother failed to remedy the\n\nproblems that caused the children to be placed outside of the home; mother suffers from a\n\nchronic mental or emotional illness so severe that she is unable to parent the children;\n\nmother demonstrated a lack of commitment to the children by her unwillingness to\n\nprovide an adequate permanent home; and the children were abandoned by their fathers.\n\nMother appealed; the judgment was affirmed. See In re S.W., R.W., J.W., 6th Dist. Lucas\n\nNo. L-20-1204, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4697218\"><a href=\"/opinion/4893439/in-re-sw/\">2021-Ohio-2065</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n        {\u00b6 8} While in the midst of the case with the children, mother gave birth to J.F., in\n\nMay 2019. LCCS filed a complaint in dependency and motion for shelter care hearing in\n\nLucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, case No. JC19274734. A\n\nhearing was held, and interim temporary custody of J.F. was awarded to LCCS.\n\n        {\u00b6 9} On July 15, 2019, mother and father were ordered to pay child support of\n\n$80.00 per month for J.F. On January 16, 2020, mother filed a motion to terminate her\n\nchild support, as she claimed she is actively engaged in case plan service and is unable to\n\nwork.\n\n        {\u00b6 10} On May 20, 2020, mother filed a motion for legal custody of J.F. and to\n\ndetermine support and visitation, and father filed a motion to change disposition and for\n\nlegal custody of J.F. On August 12, 2020, a hearing was held and LCCS was granted an\n\nextension of its temporary custody of J.F.\n\n        {\u00b6 11} On September 23, 2020, LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody of\n\nJ.F. On December 2 and 7, 2020, the dispositional hearing was held, on December 10,\n\n\n\n4.\n\f2020, the court announced its decision, finding LCCS\u2019s motion for permanent custody\n\nwell-taken. On December 23, 2020, the court issued its judgment entry. Mother and\n\nfather appealed.\n\n                                 The Dispositional Hearing\n\n         {\u00b6 12} LCCS called several witnesses to testify, including caseworkers and the\n\nguardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d). Stipulated exhibits were admitted. Mother and father\n\ntestified and called two witnesses. The testimony relevant to the appeal is summarized\n\nbelow.\n\n                                          Therapist\n\n         {\u00b6 13} Berdonna Green testified she is a clinical therapist at Harbor Behavioral\n\nHealth (\u201cHarbor\u201d). She started seeing father in December 2019, and father also had\n\nservices at Harbor when he was a teenager. Father was diagnosed with \u201cBipolar I,\u201d and\n\nparticipates in medication therapy and psychotherapy. Green said father reported\n\nexperiencing some improvement with depression and in managing or coping with stress.\n\n         {\u00b6 14} Green was not sure how long father and mother have been married. Father\n\ntold Green that J.F. was not in his care due to the children. Green had heard that father\n\nfelt sabotaged by one child because that child only thinks of himself and what he can get\n\nout of the foster parents.\n\n         {\u00b6 15} Green has seen father for almost a year and he attended about 85 percent of\n\nhis sessions. In order to complete therapy with Harbor, father would have to report that\n\nhe has three to five coping skills to help him manage his bipolar, and report a reduction in\n\n\n\n5.\n\fhis symptoms. Green said father has reported that he has three coping skills. Green\n\nstated father is on the path to managing his bipolar disorder. Green has weekly team\n\nmeetings with the doctors but there is no firm idea of a timeline for father\u2019s therapy.\n\n                                       Charles Allen\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Allen testified he is the community organizer for Empower 1, which takes\n\nhomeless families and houses them. The program works in three-year increments to help\n\nfamilies restructure their lives, through life planning and financial planning. Typically,\n\nthe program helps families who are together, but mother and father were in a\n\nreunification plan with children services, so it was thought the children would be home\n\nwithin a few months; it is now close to two years. Mother and father \u201cpretty much\u201d\n\nengaged in the life services until Covid, and were given space to finish the classes in their\n\nreunification plan. Empower 1 offers parenting courses, but mother and father had\n\nparenting classes with the reunification plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Empower 1 works with families so they can move into permanent\n\nsupportive housing or fair market housing, but mother and father\u2019s income was not\n\nconsistent, as it was difficult for them to maintain steady work. Mother tried to work on\n\nher obtaining her GED, but no classes were offered due to the pandemic, so she looked\n\nfor work.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Allen said it was \u201cvery difficult to * * * walk [father] through steps to\n\nunderstand a lot of different things, even how to get his pay stub or what a pay stub was.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been working with him on those things.\u201d Father\u2019s jobs were through a\n\n\n\n6.\n\ftemporary agency, so Allen did not know if father could not keep a job because of his\n\ndisability or if the jobs were just short-term. Allen thought it would probably take\n\nanother year for mother and father to be ready for fair market value housing, and he\n\nbelieved the route for them would be more subsidized housing.\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Mother and father had two initial courses to take with Empower 1, one\n\ncourse was \u201csort of a life management course which is a lot of time management and how\n\nto schedule and put things down and remember when their appointment was,\u201d and they\n\nalso had to attend biweekly meetings. In the beginning \u201cit got a little rough\u201d for them.\n\nAllen believed with the proper wrap-support services and further education, mother and\n\nfather could maintain a child.\n\n                                 Caseworker Emily Costell\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Costell testified she was an ongoing caseworker when she became involved\n\nwith mother and the children in June 2018, as the family was homeless. Mother and\n\nfather were together for a number of years before they married in July 2018. When\n\nmother and the children were staying at a shelter where father was unable to stay, the\n\nagency received calls that mother was \u201cwhooping\u201d her children and they were screaming\n\nand crying.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Case plan services were offered to mother and father, which included dual\n\ndiagnostic assessments, parenting and getting stable housing. Although mother did what\n\nshe had to do to engage in family therapy, the children were not ready to participate in\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\ffamily trauma therapy. When mother and father found housing, they assumed the\n\nchildren would be returned to them even though the other case plan services had not been\n\nimplemented. This conversation occurred almost monthly, as mother and father did not\n\nunderstand why the children were not returned to them.\n\n      {\u00b6 22} In June 2020, mother acknowledged that she may have been too harsh with\n\nthe children, but by August 2020, when Costell stopped working with the family, mother\n\nsaid she never did anything to the children. Costell said father also acknowledged at one\n\npoint that mother might have gone too far, but he does not always acknowledge it and\n\nusually minimizes mother\u2019s behavior and the risk she presents to the children.\n\n      {\u00b6 23} Mother and father have said the children were removed because they were\n\nblack and Costell was white, money-hungry and corrupt. Mother said she had never done\n\nanything to make the children fearful and she has never harmed them.\n\n      {\u00b6 24} Costell testified at the permanent custody hearing for the children. The\n\nissues which caused mother to lose custody were that she physically abused the children\n\nand she had mental health issues. Costell believed mother did not accept responsibility\n\nfor the trauma the children had gone through.\n\n      {\u00b6 25} Regarding J.F., she was deemed to be dependent, and LCCS received\n\ntemporary custody of her on July 9, 2019. Mother had Level 1 visits at the agency two\n\ndays a week with J.F. Costell observed three of mother\u2019s visits with J.F. and never saw\n\nanything inappropriate. However, Costell received a report from a security officer that in\n\nFebruary 2020, mother was focused on doing J.F.\u2019s hair, but J.F. was crying and\n\n\n\n8.\n\fscreaming. If the security officer looked at mother, she would stop, but if the officer\n\nlooked away, mother would continue to try to do J.F.\u2019s hair.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} When visits became virtual, on Google Duo, because of Covid, the foster\n\nmother reported mother missed visits or was late about six times. Father was not\n\nconsistent in visiting J.F., as he has missed visits and was late. Mother and father\u2019s visits\n\nwith J.F. were never suspended.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} Regarding housing, Costell said mother and father have housing, through\n\nEmpower 1, and live in a duplex. The duplex is appropriate and there are no concerns.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} As to father, he was referred in September 2019, to a 12-week parenting\n\nprogram, and he successfully completed the classroom portion in July 2020. He did not\n\ncomplete the observations portion, due to scheduling conflicts and Covid. Costell had\n\nconcerns with father\u2019s parenting ability as it appears he does not understand things that\n\nshe explains to him, so she did not know if he had a mental health issue or a cognitive\n\ndelay. Father also disclosed that mother has some anger issues and has been aggressive\n\nwith the children, but then he denies that he has seen any abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Father was referred in July 2018, to Unison for a dual assessment, which he\n\ncompleted in mid-July 2018. He had to be re-referred in January 2019, because he was\n\nnot following through. Then, in September 2019, he wanted to switch providers and go\n\nto Harbor. He was referred to Harbor in October 2019, and had three assessments\n\nscheduled; he cancelled two and was a no-show for the third. He rescheduled another\n\nassessment, which he attended, and he has been compliant with meeting his therapist.\n\n\n\n9.\n\f       {\u00b6 30} Costell does not think father has progressed far enough in his services to\n\nreunify with J.F. as he still has to work on his mental health, and he is still with mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Costell would have concerns if J.F. were returned to mother soon because\n\nJ.F. has special needs and she is unable to protect herself or report abuse or neglect or\n\nremove herself from those situations. J.F. was referred to Help Me Grow in June 2019,\n\nand is still involved with the program. J.F. has sensory and fine motor skill delays, eating\n\nissues and was referred to an eye specialist. Costell did not believe J.F. would be safe\n\nwith mother, and father would not be able to protect J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} Costell stated J.F. has been in the same foster home, but it is not a potential\n\nadoptive placement. Costell testified LCCS is asking for permanent custody of J.F.\n\n                             Caseworker Rhonda Nicholson\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Nicholson testified she is an ongoing caseworker for LCCS and has been\n\non J.F.\u2019s case since August 2020; case plan services for mother and father were already in\n\neffect. At the time of the hearing, mother still had housing, was engaged in mental health\n\nservices and was attending new parenting classes. Mother started out rocky with the new\n\nparenting classes, as she missed orientation and three appointments. The parent educator\n\ndid not want mother to continue, but Nicholson convinced her to give mother another\n\nchance. Mother has been compliant with the weekly classes since October 16, 2020.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Since Nicholson was assigned to the case, mother has had Level 1 visits\n\nwith J.F. Mother never missed a visit, was late or inappropriate. But, Nicholson had\n\nconcerns about mother\u2019s visits with J.F. and her ability to parent J.F. Before mother lost\n\n\n\n10.\n\fcustody of the children, it was reported the children were afraid of mother and did not\n\nwant to return home because of the abuse, but mother denied that she had abused them.\n\nAfter mother lost custody, she did not reach out to arrange a final visit with the children.\n\nNicholson contacted mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Father was still engaged with mental health services, he completed\n\nparenting classes in March 2020, and he has housing. Nicholson had concerns with\n\nfather\u2019s ability to parent and protect J.F. because he blames the children for J.F. not being\n\nhome, he feels one child sabotaged the case, he does not believe mother abused or\n\nneglected the children or acted aggressively with them, and he does not appear to have\n\nany concerns with mother\u2019s parenting style.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} With respect to J.F. being placed with a relative, Nicholson testified that on\n\nher way into court for the hearing, father asked her if she had contacted his aunt and\n\nfather said mother\u2019s adult son may be a potential placement. Nicholson did not know\n\nwhat father was talking about regarding his aunt, and although mother mentioned her\n\nadult son to Nicholson during the first home visit, mother said the previous caseworker\n\ndid not approve of her son because he was verbally aggressive with that caseworker.\n\nNicholson spoke with Emily Costell and learned the son and his girlfriend were both very\n\naggressive at the initial staffing, and the girlfriend refused to undergo a criminal\n\nbackground check. Costell\u2019s supervisor said if the couple was not willing to be cleared\n\nthrough the system, the couple could not be considered for placement.\n\n\n\n\n11.\n\f       {\u00b6 37} Regarding J.F., she is a one year old with developmental delays, she is\n\nnonverbal and very small for her age. J.F. falls a lot, has balance issues, is startled by\n\nloud noises and has feeding and texture issues. J.F. completed physical therapy before\n\nNicholson was involved, and now has weekly occupational therapy sessions, early\n\nintervention services once a month and she sees a GI doctor. The doctor wants J.F. to try\n\nmilk even though she does not like it.\n\n       {\u00b6 38} The foster mother gives J.F. formula because she is concerned J.F. is not\n\ngetting enough nutrition. Nicholson said the foster mother is very attentive to J.F.\u2019s\n\nneeds. Nicholson talked to mother and father about J.F. not liking certain foods and they\n\nsaid she will probably be a vegetarian as she does not like meat.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Nicholson testified that LCCS is asking for permanent custody of J.F.\n\n                                 Maternal Grandmother\n\n       {\u00b6 40} J.F.\u2019s grandmother testified she met J.F. at the hospital when she was born,\n\nand she stayed about three hours. Grandmother has had no interaction with J.F. since that\n\nday. Grandmother was not sure when J.F. was born.\n\n       {\u00b6 41} Grandmother said mother had six children, including J.F. Regarding the\n\nchildren who were removed from mother\u2019s care, grandmother said mother was a very\n\ngood mother to them, very attentive, she made sure they had something to eat and\n\n\u201csomewhere comfortable to lay their head.\u201d Grandmother had not seen the children in\n\ntwo-and-a-half to three years.\n\n\n\n\n12.\n\f       {\u00b6 42} Grandmother thought mother had become a better parent and person\n\n\u201cbecause she wasn\u2019t working * * * when she probably had the kids. Now she is working\n\nand * * * [has] somewhere for them to stay and * * * more money to make sure that they\n\ngot something to eat.\u201d Grandmother retired January 31, 2020, and said she is now able\n\nto help mother. Grandmother thought father was \u201cpretty nice, a pretty nice dude. He was\n\npretty kindhearted * * * a mellow dude.\u201d He was very good to mother, \u201c[b]etter man\n\nthan any of her kids\u2019 father been I think.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 43} Grandmother did not know what mother\u2019s address was, but knows where\n\nmother lives. Grandmother did not know what mother did if the children misbehaved\n\nbecause grandmother \u201cwasn\u2019t really around her like that,\u201d but mother probably believed\n\nin whoopings, as mother was whooped as a child.\n\n       {\u00b6 44} Grandmother was asked how often she sees mother and she said \u201cnot real\n\noften, but I talk to her all the time. * * * I don\u2019t drive and she don\u2019t drive so * * * it\u2019s not\n\nthat easy for me to just * * * go get her or go see her.\u201d Before LCCS was involved, \u201cI\n\nthink [mother] lived with me before [J.F.] was born and the kids were little. [Mother]\n\nlived with me for a minute. She stayed with me.\u201d Grandmother said mother and the\n\nchildren lived with her for maybe two or three years, then mother \u201cwanted to get out and\n\nget her own. You know, my apartment wasn\u2019t that big. So I let her stay with me * * *\n\nfor the kids and she could get out and get her own place.\u201d Grandmother knew mother\n\nand the children were homeless, but she did not have them live with her as \u201cI didn\u2019t have\n\nenough room for her and the kids to stay with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n13.\n\f                                    Maternal Great Aunt\n\n         {\u00b6 45} Great aunt to J.F. testified she is mother\u2019s aunt and grandmother\u2019s sister.\n\nGreat aunt met J.F. in the hospital after she was born, and has only seen pictures of her\n\nsince.\n\n         {\u00b6 46} Great aunt saw mother with the children about twice a month and mother\u2019s\n\n\u201ckids were everything to her. * * * And I\u2019m the one that took her to the grocery store and\n\nshe would buy all these groceries, and she said, girl, I got to feed my kids.\u201d Great aunt is\n\nthere for mother, if mother needs a ride or money.\n\n         {\u00b6 47} Great aunt said mother has had a hard life, and did the best she could with\n\nwhat she knew and \u201cwith the kids she did a good job.\u201d Great aunt thought mother was \u201ca\n\nvery good parent.\u201d Grandmother lost custody of mother \u201cwhen [mother] was coming up\n\n* * * [then] she eventually got them back.\u201d Mother and grandmother \u201cthey kind of\n\nclashed heads a little bit for a long time.\u201d Mother\u2019s parents did not have a \u201cvery good\n\nhealthy relationship so [mother] didn\u2019t really know too much about healthy relationships\n\nand how to bring up a person -- or a child.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 48} Great aunt did not know mother\u2019s address, but she has been to the house\n\nseveral times. The last time was when \u201cmy brother got back, and she started using my\n\nbrother because he has a bigger truck for hauling her groceries back and forth.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 49} Great aunt has not seen mother parent the children since \u201cthey took them\n\naway from her.\u201d Great aunt said mother did not have the equipment to bring up a child\n\nbecause mother lost her home, she did not have a job, she lost whatever support she had.\n\n\n\n14.\n\fGreat aunt thought the children were taken from mother because she was homeless.\n\nGreat aunt \u201cwas taking them from hotel to hotel to find them somewhere to stay. I was\n\ntaking them to shelters. And when they would kick her out of a shelter, I would go pick\n\nher up and we would find somewhere else.\u201d Great aunt also thought mother did not have\n\nthe children in school because they did not have their shots and they did not have clothes.\n\n       {\u00b6 50} Great aunt said mother now has the equipment to bring up a child as she\n\nhas a home, it is furnished, she has a husband who has a job and tries to take care of her.\n\nMother has more support now than she did then.\n\n       {\u00b6 51} Great aunt was asked if she knew the children were found to be abused and\n\ngreat aunt said \u201cI don\u2019t think it was by [mother].\u201d Great aunt looked shocked and said\n\nshe never saw mother punish the children. Great aunt said if she found out a child was\n\nabused, that would change her opinion about mother\u2019s ability to parent.\n\n       {\u00b6 52} Great aunt thought father \u201cseems to be a very nice young man, hard\n\nworking. Whenever he gets a job, he did the best he could. He didn\u2019t have any\n\ntransportation so I know at one point he was taking a bike going back and forth to work.\u201d\n\n                                          Mother\n\n       {\u00b6 53} Mother testified J.F. is 17 months old, and LCCS immediately took J.F.\n\nafter she was born. Mother was seeing J.F. twice a week for at least a year at the agency\n\nin a room with a security guard. After Covid, mother saw J.F. once a week virtually, in a\n\nvideo chat over the phone. J.F. met the children at visits at the agency before mother\u2019s\n\nvisits with the children were suspended in October 2019.\n\n\n\n15.\n\f         {\u00b6 54} Mother believed her rights to the children were terminated because she was\n\nnot acknowledging that she had done something wrong. Mother said, \u201cI can\n\nacknowledge and do agree on things that I\u2019ve done wrong and made mistakes toward my\n\nother three kids in which I\u2019ve learned through the parenting class that I\u2019m going through\n\nright now not to do and make the same mistakes again.\u201d Mother said she was \u201c[n]ot\n\ngiving them enough attention, not taking them to they doctor appointments. Not\n\nscheduling appointments, and not making sure I had transportation to get them back and\n\nforth to their appointments, and not being able to keep a roof over their head.\u201d Mother\n\nsaid she has learned \u201c[t]o maintain food, to maintain housing and to maintain the needs,\n\ngoing back and forth to the doctors and making sure her appointments are met and\n\nmaking sure that if I cancel an appointment, that I make sure that I stick to the\n\nappointment. And as well that she makes sure that she gets everything that she desires\n\nand needs and wants.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 55} Mother said she made mistakes when she punished the children, as she did\n\nnot know \u201chow to overcome the overwhelming stress that I was going through and\n\ndealing with.\u201d She learned to deal with stress by going outside, jogging, seeing family,\n\nreading, taking a bath, meditating and listening to music. Before, mother asked\n\ngrandmother to \u201ckeep the kids for a couple of days, * * * just to give me a break from my\n\nkids.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 56} Mother was asked if she heard the testimony about her doing J.F.\u2019s hair and\n\nhow it was traumatic for J.F. Mother said she heard the testimony and \u201cI don\u2019t agree on\n\n\n\n16.\n\fthat, to agree or disagree. I totally outright as much as possible disagree with that\n\nbecause I would never just let my daughter just keep continuing crying and not asking her\n\nif she\u2019s okay or give her a hug or kiss. Her [sic] just to say it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just making you\n\nbeautiful or making you pretty so your hair will be done for the day.\u201d Mother thought\n\nJ.F. \u201cwould be fussing and crying, and she * * * just possibly had got up too early that\n\nmorning. And she be too tired to even want to go through me doing her hair.\u201d Mother\n\nconcluded the foster mother had gotten J.F. up too early.\n\n       {\u00b6 57} Mother did not miss visits but was late to visits \u201c[b]ecause of the time of\n\nme coming from the grocery store or coming from another appointment.\u201d Mother does\n\nnot drive, so she walks, bikes or catches the bus. Mother has worked as a home health\n\naide for almost three months, and is getting her GED. Father also works, and the income\n\nthey make allows them to support themselves. Mother said, \u201cwe making so much money\n\nthey took us off of food stamps because we\u2019re no longer getting food stamps. So we\u2019re\n\nstill able to maintain food without having food stamps.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 58} Mother and father have lived at their home for almost two years, and pay\n\n$400 per month in rent. Mother and father also do volunteer work, a class or a meeting\n\nwith Empower 1 as a requirement for living in the house.\n\n       {\u00b6 59} Mother goes to Harbor for her mental health treatment and she has gone\n\nthere on and off since 2011. She was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder,\n\nbipolar and anxiety. To manage her diagnoses, mother takes medication, plays video\n\ngames, cooks and cleans. Mother was asked if she takes her medicine as prescribed and\n\n\n\n17.\n\fshe said \u201c[y]es, I do.\u201d She was asked if she took her medicine every day and she said\n\n\u201c[y]es, I do.\u201d She was then asked if she missed any doses and she replied \u201cI go maybe\n\nonce -- well, every other day because of the fact of -- because of my job. I don\u2019t want to\n\noversleep and be late for my job because it leads me to being late for my job.\u201d Mother\n\nworks four days a week, 8:00 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mother was asked if she has talked to her\n\ndoctor about the medicine and she replied, \u201c[n]ot lately * * * I plan on letting her know if\n\nI can only take it on a day that I don\u2019t have to work and the days that I don\u2019t have to work\n\nto being able to still have the same -- the same effect.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 60} Mother was asked about the parenting program, in which she had been for\n\nthe last two weeks, and she said she has learned \u201cphysical and verbal * * * redirection * *\n\n* [a]nd * * * how to love your child and not be physically harmful toward your child.\u201d\n\nShe thinks these have helped her be a different parent and keep her child safe and\n\nprotected.\n\n       {\u00b6 61} Mother was asked if she heard testimony that she did not always make the\n\nvirtual visits and she said she heard it, but it was not correct. Mother was asked if she\n\nmissed some virtual visits and she responded \u201cI might have missed a couple of them. * *\n\n* [T]he lady, [foster mother] was supposed to be getting in contact with me between 1\n\nand 1:30. She would call me at around 12, 1:30. She called me at 12:30 at another time\n\nor 1 o\u2019clock and then call me at 12:30 another time. So it varied on what time she would\n\ncall. So I never knew what time she was going to call on a general basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n18.\n\f        {\u00b6 62} Mother wanted the court to know that \u201cI know how to maintain and\n\nestablish clothing for my daughter, maintain food for my daughter, maintain housing and\n\nmake sure that she\u2019s safe and protected. And as well making sure that she has everything\n\nthat she wants and desires and needs.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 63} On cross-examination, mother said since the hearing a month earlier, she is\n\nno longer smoking marijuana. Mother said she is current with her mental health provider\n\nand she remembers telling her counselor that CSB was keeping the children for the\n\nmoney and her son was being coached. Mother said, \u201c[t]he close-knit relationship with\n\nme and my son before CSB had taken them, me and my son had a relationship that any\n\nmother -- or any mother and son would be jealous of our relationship because of the fact\n\nthat we were so close that my kids could come and talk to me. They could come and\n\nlaugh with me. They could come and play with me. We could do anything together that\n\nno other mother and son would possibly think to even do.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 64} Mother said it was traumatic having the children taken away as \u201cmy kids\n\nare so important to me. And doing their hair, getting their clothes clean, taking them to\n\nthe shopping mall, taking them shopping and going out to eat, and doing fun stuff with\n\nthem and traveling with them is something that I had grew up doing -- was traveling with\n\nmy family every year. That\u2019s something I wanted to do with my kids that I can\u2019t do\n\nnow.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 65} Mother was asked about J.F.\u2019s therapies and she said J.F. went to physical\n\ntherapy and goes to occupational therapy \u201cto get her coordinated to be able to stretch her\n\n\n\n19.\n\fmuscles and being able to relax her hands because she was balling up her hands.\u201d When\n\nasked if those therapies were important for J.F.\u2019s well-being, mother said, \u201cI believe they\n\nknow about [J.F.], but I don\u2019t believe that they know all the time of how [J.F.] could\n\npossibly not drink milk at all. That\u2019s the part I\u2019m not understanding why she\u2019s not\n\ndrinking milk. But she is in some form of drinking milk, but it\u2019s not the type of milk that\n\nI\u2019m drinking or her dad is drinking that it would help her bones become stronger so as\n\nshe grows. Her bones will become stronger instead of brittle.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 66} Mother was asked about J.F.\u2019s eyes and mother said, \u201cher left eye she has --\n\nI believe it\u2019s a stigmatism. I don\u2019t know. She told me before it could be, and the doctor\n\ntold her it would be possibly a tumor. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a tumor. I believe it\u2019s a\n\nstigmatism that she possibly have in her eye, and she genetically got from me from my\n\nyoung age that I received a stigmatism in my eye. And she\u2019s not able to get the one eye\n\nto be able to look straight like I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d Mother said she asked the foster\n\nmother about J.F.\u2019s eye treatment, \u201cand it, like, goes in one ear and other the other.\u201d\n\nMother was asked if she recalled saying she did not notice anything wrong with J.F.\u2019s\n\neyes, and she said, \u201cI have pictures where she is not seen with a lazy eye. Her eye is not\n\ncrossing. Her eyes looked at me like I\u2019m looking at you. And plus my husband has --\n\nhe\u2019s a first (sic) so I know -- pretty much know my daughter will be looked after.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 67} Mother said J.F. sees a GI doctor for her stomach \u201c[b]ecause from my\n\nunderstanding * * * she couldn\u2019t stand the taste of textures, or she couldn\u2019t eat meat or\n\nshe just didn\u2019t want to eat meat.\u201d Mother recalled that J.F. had problems tolerating\n\n\n\n20.\n\fformulas. Mother said when J.F. goes home \u201c[i]f [J.F.] she can tolerate milk, there\u2019s a\n\ncertain kind of milk I can give her. I wouldn\u2019t force her to drink milk if she can\u2019t drink\n\nmilk. But if she can drink milk, yes, I will give my daughter milk so, therefore, she will\n\nhave some milk that will strengthen her bones.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 68} Mother said at one time \u201cI did think that she wouldn\u2019t need them other\n\ntherapies, but being that I see that she has special needs, yes, she do need * * * them.\u201d\n\nMother changed her mind \u201cwhen I seen my daughter * * * have a patch over her eye and\n\nunderstanding that. * * * It\u2019s making it strong.\u201d\n\n                                           Father\n\n       {\u00b6 69} Father testified he is married to mother and \u201cI\u2019ve been living with her for a\n\nwhile now, like, what is it, two years.\u201d J.F. is their child and mother \u201chad two older boys,\n\nand they grown now so -- they\u2019re -- you know, they pretty much -- they don\u2019t say too\n\nmuch bad about their mother as much as they don\u2019t really, like, you know try to -- they\n\ndon\u2019t try to -- they don\u2019t really try to say anything bad about their mother last time I\n\nchecked.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 70} Father was asked, \u201c[t]here are three other children?\u201d Father replied, \u201c[y]ou\n\nsaid three other children? No. No. No. There weren\u2019t.\u201d He was then asked \u201cso when\n\n[LCCS] initially got involved with [mother\u2019s] other children, that was before you[?]\u201d He\n\nsaid \u201c[t]hat was the time when we were separated. When we got in -- they said we got in\n\na little proclaimed altercation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n21.\n\f       {\u00b6 71} Regarding his understanding of LCCS\u2019s reasons for removing the children,\n\nfather said, \u201c[w]ell, when it came down to that, I knew very well. And I witnessed a lot\n\nof things that were going on at the time when we were living in shelters. And what they\n\nwere pretty much saying was that somebody pretty much -- somebody that was next door\n\nto us that was, like, a resident at the shelter at that time pretty much said that -- and I\n\nwasn\u2019t there but when I was there, I didn\u2019t see none of the stuff go on.\u201d Father was asked\n\nthe question again, he said, \u201c[w]ell, their concern I feel like they should have did, like,\n\nmore research before they just took them the way I see it.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 72} Father stated LCCS\u2019s allegations were abuse and neglect, but \u201chow can\n\nsomebody neglect somebody if they keeping their eyes on them 24/7? * * * And then\n\nwhen it come down to abuse, when you all say abuse, I understand the mother, you know,\n\nif she choked the child or tried to kill the child or anything like that. But none of that\n\nstuff never happened.\u201d Regarding concerns with physical abuse, father stated, \u201c[t]o be\n\nhonest, she probably disciplined them, but it wasn\u2019t major. It was more like a warning,\n\nlike, don\u2019t do this again like any mother would do. I mean my momma did it.\u201d Father\n\nwas asked what the physical abuse incidents were and he said, \u201c[t]he incidents that pretty\n\nmuch happened -- I am going to be honest. Me and her used to get in arguments, and the\n\nkids used to see that. Yes, we had a rough relationship at one time. Yes, we had a lot of\n\nthings going on. Yes, she probably got too bothered about certain things. She was\n\nprobably stressing and over the edge, but at the same time I always used to work things\n\nout with her and her kids. There were times when I come out my pocket and she\u2019ll come\n\n\n\n22.\n\fout her pocket, and we\u2019ll feed them. There were times when we would just go to\n\nGoodwill because I was budgeting on the checks that I was getting.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 73} Father thought mother was a really good mother, so he cannot say that her\n\none child was abused. Father said he heard the caseworkers\u2019 testimony that he did not\n\nunderstand or believe the allegations or concerns, but he \u201cunderstood everything. But at\n\nthe same time I\u2019ve got to go by the beliefs of the child, and that\u2019s understandable. I can\n\ndo that. But if it\u2019s nothing truthful in that, you all -- you know, you all remember the\n\nsituation to my rights of the constitution. What else can I say?\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 74} Father said he was concerned because he talked to the one child who said\n\nhe lost his virginity and had sex with a 24-year old. \u201cSo it was like at that time I had to\n\nreally, you know, remind myself that this lady ain\u2019t really paying attention like she\u2019s\n\nsupposed to. * * * LCCS, they got to be responsible and accountable for even allowing\n\nthat to happen.\u201d Father raised the concern because he wants the court to know \u201cI think\n\nit\u2019s a lot of re-appealing we are doing with case. Because those ain\u2019t my biological kids,\n\nbut for my concern for her, I just wish, you know, they can change this whole matter and\n\ndo this case over again. You know, to really do their studies on it and really get to know\n\nthe kids more. Because kids going to tell anybody anything. I was once a kid as well.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 75} Father was offered case plan services when LCCS first became involved\n\nwith mother and the children because he was married to her and they lived together. He\n\nsaid, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna to lie, I probably didn\u2019t come to every last one of them * * * Emily\n\nCostell was giving me my stuff last minute. * * * [S]he really didn\u2019t want to put me on\n\n\n\n23.\n\fthe case for real when her kids got tooken (sic) away.\u201d Case plan services continued after\n\nJ.F. was born, with reunification as the goal.\n\n       {\u00b6 76} Father did not always agree with how mother disciplined the children, \u201cshe\n\ngot this thing, you know, with her that kind of creeped me out. When she got, you know,\n\nmad at me when I asked her, you know, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do this, it wasn\u2019t like abuse\n\nor nothing like that. It was just the way she used to get mad at the kids * * * she\u2019ll get --\n\nnot violent with them. She would cuss them out, so I would say, no, don\u2019t do that * * *\n\ndon\u2019t yell at your child.\u201d Father felt like mother would cherish and nourish J.F. because\n\nmother \u201ccame a long way. Just to be honest with you all, * * * she been doing -- you\n\nknow, she was doing fine. Plus she understands well what she did wrong on some things.\n\nBut somebody who put abuse and neglect still doesn\u2019t make it right, putting something on\n\nsomeone knowing it\u2019s not true.\u201d Father said he will protect J.F., as she is his first child.\n\n       {\u00b6 77} Father said visits were going well until one child \u201cmade the allegation that\n\nher mother allegedly smacked her. * * * [H]ow can you smack somebody when there\u2019s\n\nfull of cameras? * * * [H]ow can the mother smack the child * * * It just -- it\u2019s\n\npropaganda.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 78} Father was diagnosed with bipolar during J.F.\u2019s case, and he takes\n\nmedication which keeps him content. Father agreed with his therapist\u2019s report, but he\n\nwas surprised that she had not had a conversation with the doctor and treatment team.\n\nFather thought if the therapist had the conversation and he had successfully completed his\n\nmental health care, that would have impacted how LCCS viewed his progress. Father\n\n\n\n24.\n\fbelieved it would have taken his therapist to say that he had coping skills in order for\n\nLCCS to say he had successfully completed mental health services, but she did not testify\n\nabout that. Father said he would continue his therapy, as he is starting to like it because\n\nhe has someone he can talk to about his problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 79} Father said Rhonda Nicholson told him LCCS\u2019s concerns were \u201cmy wife.\n\nAin\u2019t no -- ain\u2019t nothing regarding me. It\u2019s something that LCCS not appreciating what\n\nmy wife did. All she did was speak her mind about some things, and you see what\n\nhappened.\u201d Father said he did everything that he was supposed to do, \u201c[m]y daughter got\n\nwipes, * * * Pampers, * * * a bed. * * * What is the problem?\u201d Father stated he learned\n\nabout safety measures, how to protect his daughter, and patience.\n\n       {\u00b6 80} Father said there was \u201c[n]o proof\u201d of domestic violence between him and\n\nmother. Regarding housing, father said \u201c[s]ome people say it\u2019s housing assisting, but how\n\nis it house assisting when I pay rent and lights and gas? It\u2019s not for free.\u201d Father believes\n\nhe can maintain housing. He was asked about getting independent housing, and father\n\nsaid, \u201cjust me staying at the place right now, that\u2019s independently done. * * * [Y]es it\u2019s a\n\nprogram, but it teach you how to manage your own well being.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 81} Father is currently employed and is still trying to get his GED. When he\n\ngets paid, the temporary employment agency takes half \u201cplus the state child support is\n\ntaking my money too. Every time I get a job, they take about $80 or maybe like $115.\u201d\n\nFather believes he is in a position to take custody of J.F. As to other services which may\n\nbe needed, father said, \u201cone thing based on what I\u2019m hearing, that she do need special\n\n\n\n25.\n\fneeds for her eye doctor, you know, dental sooner or later. Because she\u2019s getting bigger.\n\nBased on her eating, there\u2019s a good chance she might be vegan.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 82} On cross-examination, father said he had proof that the children were not\n\nabused, but \u201cnot physical evidence.\u201d Father feels railroaded by LCCS because some of\n\nthe allegations made by the children against mother were not true and the children were\n\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d taking advantage of their situation with the foster parents. Father does not\n\nbelieve mother smacked the child during a visit. Father does not like Lucas County\n\nChild Support taking money out of his paycheck \u201c[b]ecause that\u2019s not my baby mama.\n\nThat\u2019s her right there.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 83} Father said his sisters could watch J.F. while he is working. He was asked\n\nwhere his sisters lived and he said, \u201c[o]ne of my sisters -- I ain\u2019t going to lie. To be\n\nhonest, she live in the Greenbelt. And then I have another sister, and she live in the\n\nGreenbelt as well.\u201d Father said a lot of people talk bad about the Greenbelt apartments.\n\n       {\u00b6 84} On further cross-examination, father said when he married mother they\n\nwere homeless. Father admitted he was kicked out of a shelter \u201c[b]ecause of arguing that\n\ntook place.\u201d When the children were removed from mother\u2019s care, father was on the case\n\nplan, but the caseworker would not let father visit the children. Father heard one child\n\nwas deemed to be an abused child, but \u201cwhen you all said that my wife had burnt him --\n\nwell, somebody said it. Somebody said that they had checked a burnt mark on his back\n\nsaying that, I guess, she burned him, and that wasn\u2019t even true. * * * He burnt himself.\u201d\n\nFather said the finding of abuse was wrong and \u201c[i]f you\u2019re feeding your kid and clothing\n\n\n\n26.\n\fyou kid and they have a roof over then head, that\u2019s not mistreated. But sometimes\n\nparents have to discipline they kids. By law you can hit the child in the buttocks, but not\n\nwith a belt but you hand.\u201d Father acknowledged the children were not seeing doctors\n\nbecause of transportation problems.\n\n       {\u00b6 85} Regarding reports made by the children, father said \u201cyes, you supposed to\n\nbelieve the child, yes. Yes, that\u2019s absolutely true. You supposed to believe the child if\n\nthey got -- if it comes down to abuse, molestation, whatever the case is. But if it\u2019s not\n\naccurate enough and if you know it\u2019s not accurate enough and you know, it just a whole\n\nlittle game of propaganda that you all playing with, yeah, it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d As\n\nto the child who said she was slapped by mother during a visit, \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t play any little\n\ngames with your momma based on telling any story.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 86} Father said LCCS filed the permanent custody motion because mother\n\nspoke her mind and father \u201cnot agreeing with half of the things that you all saying.\u201d\n\nRegarding his concerns about the one child having sex, father was asked if he called the\n\nagency to report it and he responded \u201c[n]o, not at that time. Well, as a matter of fact I\n\ndid, but nobody ever answered. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, right. Nobody ever\n\ndid answer. If you\u2019re talking about -- or are you talking about me talking about -- [?]\u201d\n\nAlso, father did not raise the issue at the 90-day review meeting in June 2020, or with the\n\ncaseworker because he did not think he would be believed.\n\n\n\n\n27.\n\f                          Foster Mother and Parents\u2019 Rebuttal\n\n       {\u00b6 87} Foster mother testified she has fostered children for 50 years, and has been\n\ncaring for J.F. since she was released from the hospital at two days old. J.F.\u2019s difficulties\n\nupon leaving the hospital included tremors for the first few months and feeding issues of\n\ngagging and vomiting, she could not tolerate milk, she was weak on one side and she\n\ncould only roll to one side; J.F. was listed as failure to thrive. The agency recommended\n\nHelp Me Grow for J.F., and she was referred to a gastrointestinal doctor, physical therapy\n\nand occupational therapy for her feeding and sensory issues and deficits. Foster mother\n\ntakes J.F. to appointments and to twice-a-week visitations with mother and father.\n\n       {\u00b6 88} J.F. had an MRI after foster mother noticed problems with J.F.\u2019s eyes and\n\nthe pediatrician sent J.F. to an eye doctor. J.F. saw the eye doctor in October 2020, and\n\nthe doctor thought there may be issues with the optical nerve not getting the right blood\n\nsupply. J.F. was prescribed glasses and an eye patch.\n\n       {\u00b6 89} Foster mother talked to mother and father about J.F.\u2019s services, but\n\n\u201cwhenever I would bring up anything, the only response I got was if she were with me,\n\nshe wouldn\u2019t have these issues or I don\u2019t see these issues.\u201d When mother and father were\n\nallowed to go to J.F.\u2019s appointments, foster mother would tell them about the\n\nappointments, yet mother said she was never told, so the caseworker had foster mother\n\nwrite a list of the appointments for mother. Mother and father went to one appointment,\n\nfor the GI doctor, although there were at least six appointments on the list. Thereafter,\n\n\n\n\n28.\n\fmother and father did not ask about J.F.\u2019s services, her MRI results or why she had a\n\npatch on her glasses.\n\n       {\u00b6 90} Foster mother said father told her that CSB was against him, and the\n\nchildren made up all of the stories about mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 91} Mother testified, in rebuttal, that foster mother told her about four of J.F.\u2019s\n\nappointments, but mother \u201chad meetings on the days that she [foster mother] set doctor\n\nappointments. One I was able to get to, the other one right before the pandemic had\n\npretty much sent me to not being able to go because I had other appointments to go to.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 92} Mother had concerns that J.F. was not drinking milk, and nobody has\n\nhelped to alleviate those concerns. Mother also had issues with the way the foster mother\n\ntook care of J.F. because sometimes J.F. would have on dirty clothes that had not been\n\nwashed, and when mother would change J.F.\u2019s diaper she would \u201cstill have stuff in\n\nbetween her legs.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 93} Father testified, in rebuttal, that his main concern was that J.F. would come\n\nto visits with \u201cnot good hygiene,\u201d and \u201c[t]here were times where it felt like the clothes\n\nthat she was wearing was already wore before or after. There were times when she\n\nwould come with * * * snotty nose, * * * face, all crusty. * * * I believe a kid, you know,\n\nshould be nourished by their hygiene even down to their skin. Plus my daughter got\n\nmelanin, so it\u2019s important.\u201d Father stated \u201c[i]t was just my main concern her coming\n\nthere like that. I didn\u2019t like it. * * * Just giving my daughter just any kind of way to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n29.\n\f                                   GAL Chris Kimberly\n\n       {\u00b6 94} Kimberly testified she was the GAL appointed to represent appellant\u2019s four\n\nchildren in August 2019, after the previous GAL was reassigned. Kimberly spoke with\n\nthe previous GAL and received notes and a report. Kimberly conducted an independent\n\ninvestigation, and believes it is in J.F.\u2019s best interest for permanent custody to be granted\n\nto LCCS.\n\n       {\u00b6 95} Kimberly had concerns with mother\u2019s ability to parent and manage her\n\nmental health, and there were concerns with father\u2019s ability and willingness to protect J.F.\n\nbecause he believes everything mother says or always takes her side. Kimberly observed\n\nmother and father parent the four children throughout the case, and they have not been\n\n\u201ccapable or able to have gotten all [of] the benefits of services that they really need to\n\nparent safely and effectively.\u201d Mother was \u201cvery, very slow to engage\u201d in some services,\n\nshe completed some services, some she did not do and some she started but did not finish.\n\nKimberly said a therapist suggested mother could benefit from trauma counseling.\n\n       {\u00b6 96} Regarding visits, prior to Kimberly\u2019s involvement, mother and father had\n\nLevel 2 visits with the children at the agency in a room monitored by agency staff. When\n\nKimberly was appointed, the family was at Level 1 visits at the agency with agency staff\n\nsupervising. For a very brief time, the parents had Level 2 visits with J.F., until October\n\n2019, when the incident occurred with the one child. At that point, J.F.\u2019s visits moved\n\nback to Level 1 and the visits with the children were suspended. Mother was really\n\n\n\n\n30.\n\fconsistent with visits while father was a lot less consistent. Before Covid, the GAL\n\nobserved at least three visits between the parents and J.F.\n\n       {\u00b6 97} J.F. has developmental issues including tremors, clenching, feeding issues\n\nand eye issues. She is very small and slow to gain weight. J.F. is in need of continuing\n\nservices and someone who is diligent about her medical care Kimberly said in March\n\n2020, at a 90-day review meeting, it was brought up that J.F. has a lazy eye, but mother\n\nsaid no, she does not. The proper eye doctor had to be found, then it took six months to\n\nget an appointment due to Covid, but it was determined there was nothing wrong with\n\nJ.F.\u2019s optic nerve.\n\n       {\u00b6 98} Kimberly does not believe mother has made the progress in services and\n\ngained the understanding needed to be a safe and secure parent. Mother continued to not\n\ntake the safety of the children seriously and mother did not seem to take J.F.\u2019s services\n\nseriously. Kimberly does not think father has fully benefitted from services so that he\n\nwould be able to provide an independent level of protection for J.F. It appears to\n\nKimberly that no matter what evidence exists, father will never believe mother was a\n\ndanger to her children, as father wholeheartedly endorsed her parenting.\n\n       {\u00b6 99} Kimberly was asked about her report, in which it was noted that J.F.\u2019s\n\nmeconium tested positive for THC. The GAL believed that information was in the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n       {\u00b6 100} Kimberly testified housing was the concern that caused LLCS to become\n\ninvolved with the family, but housing is no longer a concern.\n\n\n\n31.\n\f                                Juvenile Court\u2019s Decision\n\n       {\u00b6 101} In its December 23, 2020 judgment entry, the juvenile court found, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), that J.F. could not and\n\nshould not be placed with either parent within a reasonable time, and pursuant to R.C.\n\n2151.414(D)(1), it was in the child\u2019s best interest to grant permanent custody to LCCS.\n\n       {\u00b6 102} The court noted the parents secured housing through Empower 1, a three-\n\nyear program, and have been in the program for two years, as of December 2020, and\n\nthere was testimony that the parents are not qualified for independent housing and it does\n\nnot appear they will qualify in the near future. The court referenced caseworkers Costell\n\nand Nicholson\u2019s concerns with mother and father\u2019s ability to parent, and observed that\n\nmother continues to deny she abused the children or negatively impacted them, and father\n\nbelieves the children lied about mother abusing them. The court discussed the parents\u2019\n\nvisits with J.F. The court recognized J.F. has special needs, is on a specialized diet and\n\nhas therapy and doctor appointments.\n\n       {\u00b6 103} The court mentioned the parents\u2019 mental health services, that mother\n\nsuffers from chronic mental illness which is so severe that she is unable to provide an\n\nadequate permanent home for J.F., and mother has difficulty understanding certain\n\nconcepts, like wanting to give J.F. milk when she cannot tolerate it. Father has difficulty\n\nexpressing himself and has tangential and odd thinking, according to his Harbor records.\n\n       {\u00b6 104} The court concluded R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (2), (4), (11) and (14) applied,\n\nand found the following: the parents failed to substantially remedy the problems causing\n\n\n\n32.\n\fJ.F.\u2019s removal, and although the parents made some progress in their case plan services,\n\nthey did not make significant progress to support reunification with J.F., including still\n\nhaving visitation with J.F. under the most restrictive level offered by LCCS; the parents\n\nsuffer from chronic mental illness which is so severe that they are unable to provide an\n\nadequate permanent home for J.F.; the parents demonstrated a lack of commitment to J.F.\n\nby failing to consistently support or visit J.F. or attend her medical and therapy\n\nappointments.; mother had her parental rights to a sibling of the child involuntarily\n\nterminated, and the parents failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that they\n\ncan provide a legally secure permanent placement and adequate care for the health,\n\nwelfare and safety of J.F.; the parents are not able to care for J.F.\u2019s basic necessities,\n\nincluding her special needs; and the parents did not make enough progress in their case\n\nplan services to remedy the reasons for removal, including physical abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 105} The court also concluded, under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(a) and (d), that\n\ngranting permanent custody to LCCS is in J.F.\u2019s best interest, and further found: J.F. was\n\ndoing well in her foster home where she has been since birth; J.F. has special needs\n\nwhich are all being met at her current placement; and J.F. needs a legally secure\n\npermanent placement which cannot be achieved without granting permanent custody to\n\nLCCS, as no alternative plan is possible.\n\n                              Standard - Permanent Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 106} The juvenile court may grant permanent custody of a child to a children\n\nservices agency if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) the existence of\n\n\n\n33.\n\fat least one of the four factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) through (d), and (2) the\n\nchild\u2019s best interest is served by granting permanent custody to the agency.

Mother\n\ncontends she was compliant with her case plan services, including parenting, visitation,\n\nhousing and mental health treatment, and time is \u201cavailable under the statute to address\n\nresidual parenting issues for this child.\u201d Mother submits \u201cshe acknowledged from the\n\n\n\n36.\n\fwitness stand that she had made mistakes in treatment and discipline\u201d of the children.\n\nMother maintains the juvenile court abused its discretion by terminating her parental\n\nrights to J.F.1\n\n       {\u00b6 112} A review of the record shows LCCS established, inter alia, that mother\u2019s\n\nparental rights to the children had been involuntarily terminated. Mother had the burden\n\nof proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that she remedied the condition which\n\ncaused the termination of her parental rights.\n\n       {\u00b6 113} Upon review, we find mother did not present evidence which produced a\n\nfirm belief that she can provide adequate care for J.F.\u2019s health, safety and welfare. While\n\nmother may have been compliant with many of her case plan services, J.F. has special\n\nneeds, not all of which mother has appreciated, and J.F. requires therapies and doctors\u2019\n\nvisits, most of which mother has not attended. Transportation issues were one of the\n\nreasons mother did not take the children for medical care in the previous case, and\n\ntransportation continues to be a problem for mother, as she does not drive.\n\n       {\u00b6 114} In addition, mother has failed to show that she sincerely recognizes and\n\nacknowledges the role she played in traumatizing the children as a result of physically\n\nabusing them. Thus, mother did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that she\n\nremedied the condition which caused the removal of the children and the termination of\n\n\n\n1\n  Abuse of discretion is not the appropriate standard of review in a termination of parental\nrights case. Rather, we review the record to determine whether the juvenile court\u2019s\nfindings are supported by clear and convincing evidence. See In re P.W., 6th Dist. Lucas\nNo. L-12-1060, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2012-Ohio-3556</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 19.\n\n37.\n\fher parental rights to the children in the previous case. Further, while there may be time\n\nremaining on J.F.\u2019s case, LCCS has been involved with mother for well over two years,\n\nand the same issues remain. Mother has not established that if she were given more time,\n\nshe would rectify the issues.\n\n       {\u00b6 115} Therefore, contrary to mother\u2019s claims, we conclude the juvenile court did\n\nnot commit an error of law, and there was clear and convincing evidence supporting the\n\njuvenile court\u2019s termination of mother\u2019s parental rights to J.F. Accordingly, the first\n\nassignment of error is not well-taken.\n\n                                Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {\u00b6 116} Father asserts LCCS did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that\n\nJ.F. could not be returned to him, in part because five months were still available to him\n\nduring which J.F. was still eligible for continued temporary custody by LCCS. Father\n\nargues he was compliant with his case plan services, except visits, as he completed a dual\n\ndiagnostic assessment and the classroom portion of parenting classes, he is employed, he\n\nhas stable housing and he has engaged with mental health care providers.\n\n       {\u00b6 117} Father admits his visits were not consistent, but claims there is no\n\nallegation of improper handling of J.F. when he did visit her. Father also acknowledges\n\nhe did not believe the children were truthful when they said mother abused them, and he\n\nnotes he was not a party to the previous case because the children are not his.\n\n       {\u00b6 118} Upon review, we find LCCS did present evidence which produced a firm\n\nbelief that J.F. cannot be returned home to father, as LCCS offered witness testimony that\n\n\n\n38.\n\ffather cannot provide adequate care for J.F.\u2019s health, safety and welfare. Although father\n\nwas somewhat compliant with his case plan services, the progress he made was marginal,\n\nparticularly as it directly relates to J.F. and her care. Father\u2019s visits with J.F. were\n\ninconsistent, and father does not appear to fully comprehend J.F.\u2019s developmental\n\ndisabilities and other medical issues. J.F. has had many therapy and doctors\u2019\n\nappointments, but father attended only one appointment. Just like with mother,\n\ntransportation is an issue for father because he does not drive. What is more, father does\n\nnot seem to believe that mother abused the children, as the majority of the time, he claims\n\nthe children lied about being abused by mother.\n\n       {\u00b6 119} Finally, despite time remaining on J.F.\u2019s case, father has produced no\n\nevidence to suggest that if he were given additional time, he would complete the steps\n\nnecessary to reunify with J.F. Throughout these proceedings, father has shown a lack of\n\nprogress in the areas directly concerning J.F., he failed to participate in all case plan\n\nservices, and he did not consistently acknowledge the abuse suffered by the children at\n\nmother\u2019s hands. Father has been provided with ample opportunity to take corrective steps\n\nand has been unable or unwilling to remedy and improve the situation.\n\n       {\u00b6 120} We therefore conclude the juvenile court did not err when it terminated\n\nfather\u2019s parental rights to J.F. The court considered J.F.\u2019s best interest, and placed her\n\nbest interest above all else. The court properly found, and the record clearly shows, J.F.\u2019s\n\nneed for a legally secure permanent placement could not be achieved without a grant of\n\n\n\n\n39.\n\fpermanent custody to LCCS. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is not well-\n\ntaken.\n\n         {\u00b6 121} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of\n\nCommon Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.
